The project is based on pretrained models, I used MODNet-background substraction and Toonify GAN- cartoonization purposes based models for solving the tasks asked 
in a hackathon. 

The original model repository for background removal used is here - https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet

The original model repository for cartoonization used is here - https://github.com/SystemErrorWang/White-box-Cartoonization/
