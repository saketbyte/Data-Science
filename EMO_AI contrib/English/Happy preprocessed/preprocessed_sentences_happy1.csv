ugh you just made me feel a negative emotion i can not forgive you or show you love until i hurt you back or give you the silent treatment until you prostrate yourself and beg for forgiveness

that fragmentation of our attention creates suffering and it is not until we stop for moment that we realise how busy our minds actually are
love between women is a wonderful gift
virtually every form of electronic engagement takes away from happiness tv internet talking on cell video chat texting social media computer games and even listening to music on your phone pushes us away from happiness longterm
i believe many people are living under an illusion
i end my case there
it was you so i texted you and we found out how we were both artists and clicked instantly we stayed friends for a few months until our feelings told us otherwise
and what the fuck are you crying about you are the one who wants to break up
her bio was simple but she probably had no idea what to put thinking back it seems incredible a simple swipe would create a new chapter in each others lives
i really could not be happier i feel like i might tear up again over how wonderful he is to constantly deal with me having these episodes i can not control knowing how to calm me down
i am grateful my boyfriends friend bought us taco bell last night and even gave us extra food because he could not eat all of his i could because i am pregnant and needed to eat something beside ramen and potatos lol damn cravings have me wanting a sushi crunchy roll but that is toxic for my baby and i got a crunchwrap instead so it is a win either way
push yourself to achieve great things be happy but also be sad without sadness you can never truly appreciate happiness
does it i am 18 i never had a girlfriend its just because i treat love like something special
what is your reality or what do you see the goal or the assumed hinderance
i gave her my phone and told her the pin so she can play her music she froze for a moment trying to process that i just told her the pin to my phone
6 times in 7 hours just because the passion next to the emotional connection is like nothing i have ever experienced before
i really do not so
we clicked even more staying up late to text and play imessage games even though we were strangers
previously the longest pin was for 75 years they created a new acknowledgment just for john

he took me to the place where we had our first kiss told me he loved me more than anything in the world and that he will always be with me his knee barely touched the ground before i said yes
i posted this here as opposed to in any nonmonogamous group because in my eyes this is as much if not more a topic about love rather than nonmonogamy
he was frustrated and seemed sad he talked about feeling sick and he suddenly started needing you for emotional support
now i have met someone new he is so wonderful and he spoils me i am a simple girl so anything someone does for me is more than enough
today we look at how we can stop the habit of overthinking or excessive thinking we look at our addiction to thinking and how we can choose to live in the present moment rather than living with such busy minds to learn how to control the mind in this way is a real path to happiness

we started stirring in the morning and ended up face to face still all tangled up in each others embrace next thing you know we are kissing passionately and my heart was in full on overload i caught the feels like i never had before and only rarely since
at first it felt weird like i was feeling an emotion that was never felt by anyone ever i am thanks to god not suicidal and never been but it felt like i had a purpose in life for the first time i have never been more scared of death before
so here is how the convo went down afterwards
i hung out with him once and never left i did the same with my previous ex as well

your love was nothing more than a burden and prison to her she treated you like trash and somehow convinced the love you gave her had no value
now that i have cleared that up love is nothing more than a dangerous addiction i have been in love many many times
we are all sacred
i realised that there was nothing wrong with my life and it was seriously amazing
then we fail do not fail bro get out the way
but i just did it i sent my first business email asking an organization if they would be interested in my services for an event it felt great i was ecstatic to just send the email i have been dreading it seems like nothing but it was just such a release of not caring i guess i do not really know
here are some examples when all is said and done more is said than done
like i have mentioned i heard from a friend that she had broken up with her bf a while ago
jennifer became an awardwinning gymnast using her buttocks hips and arms
i love her good naturedness her laugh her humour her strength and empathy her spirituality etc the only thing is that she is almost 2 years older than me

what is crushing these people is not the event since there are other people it does not crush but their opinion about it do not hesitate however to sympathize with them in words and even maybe share their groans but take care not to groan inwardly as well
i have met my soulmate we have been dating for 253 months now and he is everything i could ever want in a man we are so compatible and right from the start i knew there was something different about him
i want to know if this or falling in love with a friend is something common
a dream that i did not even know i had
i do not think they ever will though has this happened to anyone else out there
we can be doing everything or doing nothing and i would be happy
everytime he talks about getting on the computer again i try to show that i want his attention but i feel a sort of guilt
it always gets better
she actually said love you sausage chicken and then i said what and she just replied sausage chicken i did not think anything of it and thought that i must be imagining things

anybody who wants to live life by design and increase their happiness and personal well beinghi guys i am a 27 y
that was faith and it was right
i just needed to voice this being so busy i can not really maintain friendships other than the very few i have had since the sandbox and even then they are just as busy as i am and recently we have all been torn apart
lives are led at court ii things gravitate toward what they were intended for
you want me out of your life this is not like you
meanwhile another best friend m started dating her bfff so we crossed paths often in our circles in time we grew close and began to spend a lot of time together
im 100 sure that we all agree on the fact that the reddit chat groups are not working the way we would like but groups can be very useful right especially in these times with the virus
my girlfriend is going through a lot lately personal issues i will not get into i am doing everything to make her happy make her feel appreciated and loved despite her problems
so i have been in a boat that i do not know what makes me happy i know overcoming a huge obstacle does but other than that i do not feel true happiness when talking to someone i think i am interested in i do not have a huge grin or feel like the whole world is amazing is there something wrong with me what can i do to change this
my boyfriend is the best i have ever had he puts in time and effort to be with me he shows a lot of affection and care that i have never had before he actually does anything he can to be with me and it is wonderful he makes me feel special and safe i think love for me means that you make time and effort for people that you truly care about
then you are an achiever you are the very best
one way i am going to stop wasting my timeone negative belief i am going to drop
he was so patient and kind with my parents they like to talk a lot about the most mundane things and he was so engaged and listened to all of it and told me he loved them and he can not wait to come back and spend more time with them
first off i am manifesting faster i can think of a person and i will see them literally within 2448 hours i am able to manifest finding a dime or quarter butterflies coffees parking spots etc life is becoming more of a video game and i like it a lot
my best friend my love my everything i love him so much
you turned my life around and you saved me you have shown me what love is and you are the biggest blessing i could ever ask for
with on a deeper level keep your circle fresh keep your circle full of quality rather than quantity
i now reckon upon a speedy dissolution
i sit uncomfortably numb waiting for the next step forward to our next meeting
how can this feeling be so truei wish to be kneeling just for you
we ask each other questions about what we think about things our conversations are on such a different level than i ever expected to have with a boyfriend
could you tell me is it ok to stalk a girl and meet her accidentally and speak to her or is it creepy
luckily i get my first paycheck from work tomorrow
we would not have much of a desire to understand the workings of ourselves and environment
while driving home from work i got a pretty strong urge to just chop my hair off so i pulled into the hair salon 2 blocks from home and just went in with long brown hair and came out with a short black edgy cut with bangs
mentally try to always ensure the situation is a winwin no matter the outcome running most powerful for the mind and weightlifting for a quality body
4 my children are going to bed earlier and i am way calmer and happier around hem and with them
we are both so grateful for each other and he is told me i am everything he could ever want we have both had bad relationships in the past and had both given up on finding partner
the worst feeling is waking up knowing that there is a possibility that your girlfriend is dead and you have know way of knowing
i never think about happy people they seem irrational blind naive or selfaborbed i only think about evil people they are the ones who are on my mind all the time the worst of the worst that i can think of i do not think about beautiful places i think about darkness and hiding myself away isolation
one person i am going to befriend or reconnect withone person i am going to spend more time with
let us meet it as if we were preparing to meet a good friendintentionally and consciouslyand preferably in good health
i 33m broke up with my girlfriend 31f of 2 years and the love of my life the sweet part is that i actually felt what real love is and it is nothing shy of incredible the bitter part is that it had to end because of outside forces i was not strong enough to go against my culture to be with her
it is about time you regain your freedom from the wrath of electronics turn off and get to bed
i sent her a message saying thanks for today it was shit but that it was the closure that i needed
so i have known this guy for a couple years now

somewhere along the way we believed someone else who probably gave up on their own dreams that we could not live a successful life and support ourselves and our families if we pursued that which we enjoyed that we could not have our cake and eat it to
i would still eat it because he would hate food to go to waste in the end the sandwich is made with love
instead they very calmly bore the wrong committed by their attackers
i have to believe that that is not true just because you have not felt it it does not mean that it does not exist every story has a grain of truth in it someone must have experienced it or at least seen it at one point in time to be able to write about it
when attraction is so deep and strong on one side it is just really hard to comprehend that the other might not feel the same way
stars these twinkly shiny bursts of light and color i had never seen before were suddenly cast across the sky for me for the very first time
i met him when we were 16

the only difference was that my brother now lived with us rather than my husband

this best ted talk on the extended sadness topic has absolutely 0 impact effect on me anymore i am immune to extended sadness

the problems in the world are countless and yet they will never be all fixed just like crime will never be vanquished and there will always be people taking their own lives
i never stress about him falling out of love or being tempted by anyone else when i struggle with anything he is my number one supporter
similarly only an absolute fool values a man according to his clothes or according to his social position
here is your permission to do just that and let yourself be silly many of us want to go back to the good old days but who says we can not have the heart of a child now do not let the coolness of this world dampen your shine
i hope to see you in my dreams the only place i am allowed to nowtonight my bf surprised me with his dog and flowers it made me smile to the moon and back
is this common to fall for these types of people when you are just like them
i know you absolutely respect my girlfriend and do not wish for me to break up with her or anything like that because after all you are basically perfect
she might b self conscious about it
but if the rupture is too often repeated it makes the severed part hard to reconnect and to restore you can see the difference between the branch that is been there since the beginning remaining on the tree and growing with it and the one that is been cut off and grafted back

you are the reason for my smile and my happiness i love you
hello everyone could you tell me your story on how you found happiness when was the time you said to yourself i have made it
obviously there is a lot of events i have had to skip over because this is not listen to my story
i think a lot of people carry a fake love based on how someone makes them feel or what they can do for them
the nerve of that woman finally it was time to leave i was being admitted to some shody college cosmetology school
it hurts so much i just can not stop thinking
it makes me feel finally understood by myself why i have felt and experienced all the things i have since such a young age of 15 years
so basically i have never been in love neither have i had exclusive serious relationship i have had 12 friends with benefits tho
good things come to people who wait but better things come to those who go out and get them anonymous

and she has told me she feels the same
it is one of the most profound moments of my life discovering you and our love
from this instant on vow to stop disappointing yourself separate yourself from the mob
i always wrote him off as a friend and explained that it could not be more than that often justified by the fact that i was leaving in december and had no plan to return

what do i do when my crush does not say anything about meeting up even after i bring it up but keeps texting me
her home life is a strange one she is treated with special carei am not saying that she should not b but it is kind of the whole thing her sister does most of the chores since their parents make her sister do it rather than her
i know that your depression has made you lose all hope and i am startled by how you are where you are even after everything life has thrown at you you do not think anyone can love you or stay in your life for long and maybe that is why you told me we should stop talking

flash forward 34 of a year to the present day he is 25 and i am 24 and we are more in love than ever
do we find some of our relationships are clouding our happiness maybe some of our friends are quite toxic and instead of lifting us inspiring us and making us happy are in fact a because of our unhappiness
i have been thinking about it more and more recently and i am wondering if we are both romanticizing our relationship because 1 it was the last one we have both had and 2 because we were in the honeymoon phase of course it was wonderful

i am praying to god that this virus does not because more upheaval i cannot wait to see you jaan

i 15 met a girl we loved each other one day her brother told me she was taken to the icu because she got covid19 i could not talk to her and that hurt after a few days she was taken back home because there was nothing the doctors could do when she died my world collapsed i was sad crying i had suicidal thoughts
faith it is a real thing

me and her get along pretty well and i make her laugh all the time and says i am funny person because it is nice to make her laugh especially when she is smiling too so when i do not see her sometimes i think about those good moments that make me happy a lot but i think i stared developing feelings for her because just seeing her makes my day
i hesitated to make our relationship official and now that we are he has shown me love in ways i have never felt it before
i am grateful for my team for promoting self care and supporting each other
i made a few posts on the extended sadness sites on reddit like the depression ones in the past but i think i deleted them cos they were not important this extended sadness topic has been an entirely closed topic since i just got bored with it
wow what a mix and rush of emotions it felt good it made me feel down thinking of other peoples opinions everything in between
i always strived for perfection to the point where it would limit me her imperfection drew me closer to her
life changes people change
i am too hungery
bruh you can not get mad at your partner for expressing what upsets them even if it is not deep to you it may be a serious matter to them genuine consideration is the key

he decided he had to learn it and took lessons from then on assiduously
so both me and my cousin fairly slim and small females stood by the door holding onto the poll
from myself
you still were my best friend and you still are so i moved on buried my feelings for you and went on with my life
then it felt like she was stabbing me straight through the chest gave me all these weird excuses saying we can not be in an official relationship because her last one made her suffer mentally as her ex was constantly putting her down
he admitted that those feelings of first love can never be matched for him
the best summer of my life goes by and she gets the opportunity for a much better job but was reluctant i kept nudging her to take it and we will work everything out step by step i do not regret nudging her to get this job know that it would be the catalyst for the end her old jobs sucked
i always wondered what made a good relationship and it is that closeness to the other person when i see couples cuddling and showing affection i realize it is something you can not force
me and you have been talking and i know you really like me and i do to funny part is i have been down this road before but this time i am choosing to go through it and enjoy rather than worry about what could happened
so me and my boyfriend are in a longdistance relationship halfway across the yous
the goal here is to keep having low numbers of days since if it is 1 or 2 days the emotion is in the green light meaning it is okay if it is above 3 the emotion becomes yelloworange meaning that creating that emotionmemory should be a priority because it is been a few days
i am in love with myself finally
he loved her so much and he is not a very emotional guy but he sent me paragraphs among paragraphs telling me how much he loved her
the only thing i ask for from you is to communicate with me and be honest
afterwards j revealed to me that he was bisexual which instantly got me excited but soon after that statement he also revealed that he was already talking to a girl at the moment
i am one of the fortunate few right now i can afford food next to broke but getting funds soon wifi and my basic life needs
as i stuck my left foot forward to take another step i managed to step on the bottle and slip and fall pretty hard
all of them monogamous in all of them there was this what felt like kind of trial period of either a few days to a couple weeks where we got to know each other before making it official and having this unspoken agreement that we are in a relationship
16 that incredible feeling you have right after you finish working out17 staying in bed to binge watch fav tv shows in your pjs
can you text me or something if you are running late
i simply do not care about the negative things because the reasons she broke up with me does not matter because its in the past i made my peace with it and i am happy with it
so i ask to anyone reading this please feel free to share some simple yet something she will remember date ideas
you are favored regardless of what you see because it is subject to change hence do not be deceived and walk by faith
is it normal to have someone proofread a letter that you wrote to your future significant other
i like having someone to cuddle i like that we have common interests
if they have reciprocated the same feelings what says they can not do it again though the first time i suspected they felt the same but ruled it off as me being desperate it is happening again
the realization that life is short and ends in death
but listen no rush let it flow
i tell him everything
i have never been someone who has planned their wedding since being a kid no i have dreamed about getting my own house that i can call my home
man i wish this world would kick me over already instead of leaving me on cliffhangers like that
he is not your almost boyfriend he is just an asshole who picks and chooses when he wants to acknowledge your existence
5 months we are doing a trial run of moving in together
people who have at least three or four very close friendships are healthier have higher wellbeing and are more engaged in their jobs
i have had to travel for work before not seeing each other for over a month but i could fly back at any time to see her which i did something about this was just different though
when you wake up well rested life is groovy and you are excited to take on the day life becomes simpler when you sleep well
right now it is been 6 months since we spoke and i am seeing someonebut if she called i do not know if i am strong enough to not go back to her there are so many other wonderful stable women and i am even dating one now but i do not love anyone but her
and it has been magic we have tremendous sexual chemistry shared interests and hobbies and we have great communication everything a girl could wantthen last sunday happened
i walked out of an abusive mental and emotional relationship where i had to constantly hide my true self to become someone else he would love
it is not driving you around in a nice car but accompanying you even if it means taking the midnight bus home because every second i spend with you makes me warm and happy because making sure you feel safe at the cost of reaching home at 1 in the morning is nothing compared to seeing a smile on your face after the pain you have gone through
last summer he called me and we ended up talking for over eight hours
so yeah thanks reddit i am grateful to have you around
i started thinking that we might not see each other on christmas so i planned to make a big christmas care package for her will all the stuff she liked and needed
inside i fell apart with that revelation
i entered this relationship in january my first real relationship ever at age 27 so we were able to get a few actual dates in and make it official in march right before covid hit
i came across this love story on human of new yorks instagram page today this is the by far one of the most amazing things i have read the universe does have a mysterious way of connecting people together
you would not want to lay in your death bed wondering why you were so scared of doing this one thing you wanted and regret it
jesus i rarely cry but i did that night
we have so many friends in common and we did not meet until a few months ago when i am with her the weight of the world seems easy and mundane domestic things feel romantic i do not want to scare her but every time i wake up next to her i am certain i want everything with her i love her
because we continue to respond from deep within that is control as opposed to selfcontrol like an electromagnetic device our mental wiring creates the energy that perpetuates our submission
she goes most everywhere with me and when she can not i know she will be watching through the window and excited when i return
what a gift to us all for the holidays
i remember stepping through the doors of his home
i feel the same and tell her so it is like nothing has changed and we end up getting back together again
she was sad because she wanted me to marry her son
she said i love you on call a few days ago and i swear i cried she means so much to me everything about her is just so beautiful
today i am grateful for treating people with respectdo you treat service people with respecthttpsyoutubedvjmtseg9ry
then about six or eight months later you asked if i might have been bi i did not know the term i had to look it up when i got home
she means so much to me it hurts thinking about her makes me beam and blush she is incredible she is been so patient and sweet and kind and so so understanding through this year of knowing each other i love her i have not said it yet but holy shit i love her i have loved her for longer than i have known and i have known longer than i would care to admit she is absolutely incredible
i thought about you all day and spent it entirely trying to figure out why i am feeling this way

the very important thing you should have is patienceyou need right people with you not the best people
should i say something or just go with the flow but what if i am wasting my time and just overthinking
i am grateful that i am alive and healthy i am grateful my family is in good health and spirits i am grateful for another day and a morning with such good weather
i like school but when i have a class with her its 1000x better and i just want to spend more time with her is this what love is like
she radiates happiness which makes other people happy and when other people are happy she is happydo you see how her happiness feeds her happiness
after lunch they just cuddle up together till it is 430 and my father has to get back into work but in days like this they just cuddle and kiss thewholeevening
circumstance had made this particular admiration white hot and the rest were tinder
love is based on respect trust and honesty if you are meant to be with someone it work out
the gift i gave myself of quitting cigarettesthe lovely food i have to eat
i have talked to too less girls in my life and after forgettting her now i have to forget her again what can i do
i have read online a couple times that guys never fully move on from girls they have been in love with is this true if so how does it effect future relationships how would you know when a guy is ready for the next relationship just interested in more information on this topic
i will still love them and that fact makes me happy i am glad they betrayed me now i know what kind of people they are and it makes you happy
yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances a vision or a dream or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled with wine
do whatever you like i do not give a shit about what you want and what the fuck are you crying about you are the one who wants to break up

i do not want to be just your friend my heart wants to treat you like a princess and give you the world
in other words to make ourselves happy and to make the world a better place the meaning of life is to be to be present with what we are experiencing in the present moment
it becomes almost impossible to master a skill because you simply do not have the will power to endure such irritating and tedious practice on a consistent basis for the length of time necessary to master the skill

i had been gifted a few perfumes over the years but anytime i wore something i swear i smelled like a funeral home
and i told you i was scared of losing you as a friend and that i did not want to lose you and that i was scared because you asked me once no matter what happens we will still be friends right it did not affect me then but of recent i felt that i was losing someone close to me heart without knowing why and that it had happened before and it really felt like it was happening again
he says the cutest stuff i have never loved someone as much as him it is been two years the feelings are getting stronger every day and i can not believe my luck
i am so glad that we are my life could not have turned out better and i am so lucky you are even in my life right now
but in the same time i fear that she might think that i do not care if she comes back how do i strike the right balance i am really struggling to do so
keep the faith the person your soul is searching for will come and when they do all the fears will become so much less scary because you just know love to you all
i become dissatisfied with the lack of happiness and searched for knowledge and wisdom on what truly brings happiness my research led me to this quote which helped me overcome my dilutional viewpoint of the world
from both options only one seems obtainable
i did not tho but later i told him that i was about to say it and actually i was about to say it in his language and he felt amazing and he hugged me and tell me how cute this is
and that is only if we are lucky and not working a salaried job or coming in on the weekends to spend more time doing work
the pains source is unexplainable everything in my life is at the best it could be but still i feel empty
i love you ji do not know what i mean exactly
the wolf wearing the sheeps clothes acts weak vulnerable and everything can hurt it but deep down its still a wolf it will attack the sheep and see through its disguise and try to defend its self
thank you
it is due to be lockdown the next day and we had agreed that i would stay at hers
i feel so good about myself because my favorite teacher laughed so hard at the two that i made him and then hugged me he is so nice and he always recognizes when i am panicking andor having an anxiety attack

i did the same with my previous ex as well
he is just an asshole who picks and chooses when he wants to acknowledge your existence
so powerful and deep it will forever beour hearts are so pure and love so sweet
remember that after a year of making out whenever we found ourselves alone we just stopped i think i was the one to cut it off
this is going to sound kind of cynical to you all but is does anybody know any mind games or psychological strategy to make someone fall for me i know a way but i want to know what you all know to see if it is better
he does not typically kiss me as much as i kiss him so for him to just do that a little act felt so nice
however i have also been seeing a man for the last four months he makes me feel so special and the sex is amazing he let us me be my most authentic and queer self i love and care about him so much and i just want to be together but do not feel fulfilled knowing my partner is a man
i know you are thinking that i am weird for typing that but that is how i feel
it can do anything
which can more easily lead to reasons why you could get the jobpromotionraisebetter position
viii how much more damage anger and grief do than the things that because themix
i still thought he looked good tho and i do not think that about many people so i was interested
i grew up hating how i looked i grew up comparing myself to other girls wondering how attractive i am and even going so far as to searching up body measurements of models and researching how i measure up i based myself and others on an attractive and subjective scale which seemed to somehow determine mytheir selfworth and how i treated myselfthem
how do we do this the answer is to let go of the future and the past enjoy the feeling of being alive enjoy what is right in front of us
yea there have been times where i have been happy but deep down i know i have not i want to find happiness i want to fall in love and feel genuinely loved
even him seen to like mehe did not even notice that i was not wearing my maski regret a little that i bullied him i wonder how he did not arrest me
the both of us will keep each other in a positive light and we will grow from this so that in the future the both of us can find new loves to be with
i was drinking every single day and waking up in throw up every morning just to get off work and do it all over again
i do not really have anyone to say this to except a couple friends who know what is up
3 years of one sided love what now i do not even see myself with anyone else
if you read this and i know you will i love you
they felt weird about it bad call all around
from that day on something broke in girl b she was never the same towards me
the future will eventually arrive but let us not drug ourselves with a paycheck until we finally get there let us meet it as if we were preparing to meet a good friendintentionally and consciouslyand preferably in good health
layla has truly changed my life layla has helped me to be more open minded and headstrong husband
i see it
please forgive me every word i say is true song by bryan adamsi have said some horrible things things i regret made accusations i regret
i f28 have met this amazing man 31
in time i have learnt to accept that it is part of our humannesschallenge after challenge we learn to let go a bit more
but love can hurt too
i felt fragile vulnerable
i had attempts of talking to girls and i even fell for a girl in my class when i was 17
seemed fake i felt weird about it
and i think i just want to accept that as the nature of love instead of trying to change that to be something else
it hurts even more on the holidays that i still have not found that special someone yet the loneliness and frustration
a few people can be productive while multitasking if you put your focus on things you can be more productive
gone forever forgotten
why does it hurt or not feel good when a person does not use your love languageare love languages only valid in healthy happy relationships
she loves sending heartfelt messages to me the one she wrote that night read as follows i just love you more than anything my love
at a point we were best friends or at least to me we were always there for each other
there is nothing like felling in love for someone or having a crush on someone it is just the overthinking because of which we think the other person is very important for us
i found myself in the uncomfortable position of loving 2 women and not knowing how to reconcile that i felt trapped in my marriage
there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the true you that you can be
all the nonromantic stuff had not gone away and we still shared pictures back and forth since we could not be together romantically
for this reason i created this project httpswww100dayssmilingorghttpswww100dayssmilingorg or httpswww100dayssmilingcomhttpswww100dayssmilingcom it is simple on the main page you will read the rules for you to participate it is simple
but it is just such an esoteric measure to try to decrypt why would we courageously invest ourselves for someone through any hardship who we know is just one individual out of the billions who exist on this planet yet we make them the most imperative pinnacle to be tightly painted into our lives through love we prove and surprise ourselves again and again with the possibilities of our limited beliefs to walk towards an intangible object
i recognized that i was happier but to have the people outside me especially my best friend notice it i would not have it any other way
she is really brought the best out in me and helped me from a dark place and after that amazing day we spent together i finally know what love truly feels like
back in 2015 i was a sophomore in high school and she was a freshman at the time i was already in relationship with girl a
i just met her after knowing her for 8 months i finally saw her touched her hands everything else just disappears when she is in front me i love her more than i ever could love anyone else 3
thanks anxiety
the lower things are here for the higher ones and the higher ones for one another if you set a high value on liberty then you must set a low value on everything else
you do not know how blessed i am to have you in life you have given a new meaning to my life love you
moral of the story
it is pretty hard to maintain happiness if you hate your job do not waste the best years of your life in a joyless job even if it is paying the bills what are you interested in what are you truly passionate about focus on building a career in an area that motivates you and will provide you with a high level of satisfaction and your happiness factor will go up exponentially
while everybody wants to be happy there are different happiness triggers that bring in happiness in peoples life something that makes one very happy may not make the other happy

but she did want to mark the occasion and was inspired to give 80 to 80 people with a slight catch read on
i love you more than you will ever knowi just wanted to say i am never letting go
but i feel like he was never there in the first placei mean why would sth like that happen to me how could that happen
for me was the small things the way the pillows were arranged on the bed
i am so thankful to have someone like him in my life i do not know what i did to deserve him
i am not a designer and that is the best i could do

she eventually started telling me that she had major feels exact words for me and that made me just incredibly happy
i know many people do not see these things as inherently damaging but to put it shortly i very much do
so i will be patient i will wait for you
i want a gorgeous romance that sweeps me off my feet however i have had past experiences with people who have bad intentions
then a couple years later she explained to me that i had said some really fcked up things in the passed

not to mention he is the most attractive human being i have ever encountered
what is the use of winning if it makes us sadnot just money that we earn and burn
i knew i would love working in the movie industry i can not wait to see what comes next now

my boyfriend and i were young and prideful when we first met it went so wrong and was my worst heartbreak he was my first love and i did not realize it
the entire time he was perfect he made me feel so safe and so cared for
i tried searching for happiness through people destructive things and even nondestructive things like meditation and staying clear of negative people but i just kept going back to feeling useless

when your homeless you are completely exposed to the elements and not having a jacket can mean anything from misery to death
you keep denying and denying and denying to the point it drives me crazy you say you are not gay so much it makes me believe you might be but even if you are it will not matter there are people everyone can not disappoint for me that person is my mother for you it is god himself
i swear it feels like we are in the honey moon phase again even though we have been dating for 2 years now i feel like this girl is my universe and i really cannot even fathom why i felt the way i did
so my question to you guys is how could i have helped the gentleman or what could i have done differently it pains to be able to help someone who trusts you although i was a complete stranger to him
so i decide i am going to make him a card and get all of his students to sign itniko agreed to get his class to sign it right away p5
as time progressed we started getting close and we were very happy together we hugged kissed and did all the stuff a couple would do
i excitedly took a nice shower sang the whole way through made myself a large pizza and just sat with my dogs doing absolutely nothing watching movies for 7 hours and it never felt so fun to just be by myself
it is being able to smile and able to laugh not just trying to raise our success graph

his mom said she was proud but sad she was sad because she wanted me to marry her son
so back to my question i asked myself is it really that easy to just decide to believe one day that you can and in a blink of an eye your life changes do not give up it is not going to be easy lifes meant to test you but it is those tests that make you stronger it is the struggles that make you hunger hunger for you to accomplish your dreams and succeed
it is as if we live in a trance inside the artificial world of our workplace where in order to to have financial freedom we play the role of an extra in a really shitty theatre play interacting with other uncommitted characters

i love being in a relationship that is so safe and encouraging my hair stylist even made a comment like oh i would love to chop my hair off like this but i do not think my boyfriend would like that and it made me sad i can not think of a single thing i could do to my body that i would need to get permission for or just be afraid of what my fiance would think
anything less in his opinion is simply could decheating ourselves klaus smile and happy energy are infectiousa day spent in his company would degrinch anyone
this will help us have the courage to voice and act on our values
so they run from their past ignoring their actions and destroying everything in their path one of them spreading lies about me which is why you became afraid of me
but as the week goes on the feeling eventually subsides into indifference
so me as a good friend did her a favor and got them together that did not really turned out well
many stoic ideas focus on stiff upper lip etc these help take care of yourself
i doubt if my way of loving is even right or if i am even good enough
my city has had a big surge of cases recently and its really been stressing me out she picked me up from work today and bought my flowers and mango juice it is my favorite drink

me and my boyfriend has been in isolation for a long while and in 3days i get to see him again
i have formed relationships with people before with whom there was smoke but not this fire it was so intense
have been using dating apps to meet people just for the purpose of connecting and sharing casual but meaningful intimacy
and now i am even hating the fact that i know what love feels likei am writing a book called what is love
this also applies to having a purpose greater than ourselves
show the actions that come from them once the principles have been absorbed
when she and i talked about her pregnant mom she complained that the baby is going to take up all their finances so she can not buy clothes and etc and i am not sure if she was joking
when you love who you are now who you are supposed to be will happen automatically
i could always be myself with him and i think most of the time he found my opinion strange but he still listened and understood me
you knew that the sound of their laugh and voice did not sound like anybody elsesso you wrote them off in your mind you did not look at them you did not talk to them
i should obviously be fully in love with her but the fact she asks the question makes me question my own feelings
i am grateful they give me enough hours that i have a bountiful paychecki am grateful that our family has seen endless blessings as of lately

to kiss someone else for the first time i want to be your best friend to be the maid of honor at your wedding someday
i was devastated i can not put it in words
so i watched a bunch of short documentaries today and realized that we who live in developed countries are taking literally everything for granted and need to be so much more grateful this list is not evem the half of it
yet it calls for our base nature principally and its effects can be devastatingdisarm it by delaying reactions this deactivates the psychoemotional connections
we caught up about everything going on in our lives and both ended up just drinking waters
my gratitude to the universe for this imperfect day and all those before and after
i text my best friend who is only familiar with this guy and who knows none of his friends and tell him

i think i do not know how to do this anymore or how to feel it anymore i met someone and i think that sometimes i really feel love
he plucked me out of this dark place and back up to earth i do not feel like i have ever connected with a man on this mutual level and that is not just my oxytocin speaking we have only been seeing each other a little over a month we have been inseparable since we met
we were constantly spending time around each other and i loved every second of it i loved his presence

2 i am more in touch with in control of and aware of my emotions both positive and negative 3 i manifested an email from my publisher that my book is in the final stages of formatting
people will always try to bring you but they will never unless you let them to because i have grown to understand i manifest a lot of power that i never knew i had the power to heal my scars the power to rise no matter how many times they bring me down and the power to be what you want to
the same correlation could be made thorough getting a promotion at work or another girlfriend
i can not be any happier i hope that one day i marry him he is everything i ever needed and more we have amazing communication and honesty i love him to the ends of this earth and onwards
what now i do not even see myself with anyone else it is so hard

house of representatives to agree that rosies should receive the congressional gold medal for their valiant war efforts she is now working on getting senate approval

i have zero doubt that they are happier places than in more affluent places
i mean they stopped looking for parters because they are not okay so should i be doing that too should i actually try and love myself because i have tried
so anyways i had the actual guts to text her and tell her that i feel more than friendship for her
we began texting and talking a little then more and more as time went on i found myself in the uncomfortable position of loving 2 women and not knowing how to reconcile that

if only you could see yourself through my eyes you would understand how special and lovely you are love you my princess
it develops into this crazy intense romantic i can not live without you codependency that has no match
i like that you can cook i like that you give me access to sex
i am sorry i refused to tell you my birthday that day you asked i am sorry i never told you at all
it is a small thing but it is quite really beautiful i have been dealing with way too much and taking a step back and enjoying the little things in life is amazing i used to feel hopeless burdened thought life had no meaning but now i do not even care if i have a meaning to life heck i think i found my purpose i want to enjoy these little things in life that give me joy
tonight he tickled me until i let go and then he sat the pillow smack dab in the middle of the bed
where he is not giving any of these stupid bitches the time or day straight dubbing the fuck outta them
true happiness is eternal not just a moment of joy it lasts forever it can not be destroyed
so our conclusion might be that the meaning of life is to be happy in each moment
girls it is possible if this could happen for me it can happen for anyone i swear to god i am in love with him and it is only been a few days of this
to this day he has not said he loves me and i am not trying to rush it but i have worked on myself and our relationship so that we are at a place where we are both happy and feeling the same way
believe it or not many guys love the sweet torture of a slow burn
idk i was not in the best spot to experience it but i am damn sure i felt it it is embedded into anyone no matter how distorted you might have become
you get one fun challenge a day that either covers the mental social or physical aspects of wellbeing
he makes me feel like the prettiest girl ever he loves me unconditionally and he loves me in my love language he is patient kind understanding nonjudgmental and smart
not being forced to marry at age 12 a less fucked up than other places justice system
he calls me cute funny smart sexy beautiful etc i know he really believes i am those things but i just do not see it
the life lived with feeling all emotions is such a unique perspective it allows us to know that we are human beings and we are alive
i love who he is and it is so much more than just a feeling that can evaporate like water he is handsome and his strong arms make me feel safe and protected
is your emotional state reflected in your facebook postshttpsyoutubekudfezkg4vc
i usually put the dogs outside otherwise they would try to comfort me and i am not up for that yet and then abuse umpteen pages of paper with scrawled histrionics
that we should mourn and grieve yes absolutely but never to forget that appreciation of what was and is is what will pull us through and onward
i have overflowing love for her and she is just amazing and deserves so much more i love the fact that i can tell her anything without her judging me
she says that this is the problem
but the job experience itself is not so good
i did not approach the budding relationship by diving in
i have never cared to or felt ready to be in a relationship
for many years i was not a person who wore perfume very often i just was never a fan of perfume because i always felt they were too florally smelling
i my relationship to them that we came into the world for the sake of one another or from another point of view i came into it to be their guardianas the ram is of the flock and the bull of the herd
it is like every syllable becomes a tongue twister
of course that hurt p asked to be left alone
and now i see so much more that it is not that he is not showing me he loves me it is just in different actions
i am the luckiest girl on earth for having him for kissing him for joking around with him and i hope it never ends
i could make good food on my own but when i listen to his ideas it makes it taste better
the main point of this gushing is to thank him for indirectly saving my life and making it better
i still remember that was your favorite flavor of cake i wish i could give you yours
do right do your best
well i will refer you to epicurus for payment anger carried to excess begets madness
did the popular kids in your school go on to do great things or just fizzle out
i was ready for whatever was next no matter where that would lead me tolittle i knew that less than 10 hours later i would meet my future husband in very improbable circumstances
we just exist together and appreciate each other exactly as we are and support the journey of growth we are each on
but being in love and kissing the person you love just gives you this amazing feeling i can not explain
while sorry can easily be said the title merely does it justice
she heard me and leaned into my ear like people do at a noisy event space and said why
once i was a senior in high school we got even closer like really close friends i remember one friday afternoon once school ended
the translation for those who want to knowjucilea today i became a better person know that my love for you manages to get here in write here without parentheses the city and country you are in i deilson love you very much
i am grateful that i have water and foodi am grateful that i am healthy and happy
seems rare to genuinely find real happy people
fall in love with someone who inspires you to be a better person someone who shows you the gardens within your soul where you only ever used to see cemeteries fall in love with someone who makes you believe in your goodness someone who supports you who ruthlessly encourages your mind and your talent every moment you question your purpose fall in love with someone who is proud of you
half an hour later i wake up again to her tidying our things up
she knew he would love her and she loved him too
i am currently rereading the meditations and this subreddit was created during my first read it was created on the tenth book and i have reached it already which means that if i kept posting what i read i would be posting quotes i have posted before and i thinks it is better not to post repeating stuff so it is up to your for a few days until i start reading epictetus
but it happened he is the best
she helps me truly
this is a great read the importance of happiness in work life
but for the past almost week now i have been text back and forth with another woman it was kind of wooden and a little awkward at first but now it feels like we have know each other forever
i just want you to know that a month from now or yearsi will be here waiting i promised to love you forever and always and i meant it
i know i think about it all the time because it was the first and last love i have ever felt
i felt miserable crying and looking at her with awe and sadness knowing this amazing lady i have learnt to love each and every single detail about even her imperfections is not going to be mine and i was bound to lose her because going back to england i was going to get even more desperate
i am grateful that she also bought us those explosion gender reveal powders so i can reveal my gender tomorrow finally
i still very much am
being bolder because you are buoyed by the brightness in their eyes when they look longingly at you drawing in the beauty of small moments and peaceful places because there is a newfound clarity in your eyes
so goose this ones for you i love you
call me selfish but the reason why i did this is because i am not goodlooking people always reject or block me everytime i am looking for chatmates using my original photos
we can marry whomever we want antimiscegenation laws are gone and social norms have been relaxed empowered women sexual liberation and lesbianism mean there are fewer white women available or desirable as wives white men are looking elsewhere especially to asian women
i want to stop worrying bc it takes so much away from the now the present with him i love him so much
eventually she came to find that he was sleeping with one of his coworkers and had cheated on her multiple times
it is important to step out of ones mentally created shadows and embrace the heartwarming light of living fully
i do have good days at work but there are times when i do not feel so good
there is a bitter backlash from white women who resent this but nobody wants to marry a bitter woman
about 8 months prior to meeting me she came out of a relationship a terrible one at that
so go look at a collection of cute animals on the web
i am grateful that i meditated this morning
but after talking to you there is a certain clarity and reminder in me of what love is supposed to be
my heart sank why you i thought
i am going 08 with relationships so i do not feel anything when they say no it is just an expectation that i get rejected
it works 100 of the time
that was all until this summer when my friend started speaking and hanging out more often with another guy that she thought was closer to her ex initially also when we were hanging out all three of us she kind of felt closer to that guy
besides having worked in retail all of my life i could not see a way to get a better paid job which would make me feel more of an adult and less of an eternal teenager
the friends boys around my age were so kind
ow my heart
and then my other partner is equally as perfect its so insanely funny sweet knows just how to make me stop worrying we fall asleep in video calls and listen to music using streaming sites we have never met but it has been there for me since i was a child and we have grown together completely
it happened over quarantine when we would text all day and then talk on the phone all night
but that is not how life has worked out do not worry i do not give up that easily but at the end of the day we all have to admit that there is things that are not entirely in our control in the past i used to fight that fact and do stupid selfish stuff that would hurt the people i liked loved that is because i myself was not entirely ok
""
at the same time i notice how she pays a lot of attention to other people rather than me i truly despise love if this is what it is
so i literally will call him crying and rant about work and he is so sweet he does his best to make me feel better despite knowing there is nothing he can do to solve my problem
educated exvagrants of broken homes we conquer our challenges like they were made for us to step over you are better than the dream i had
one new place i am going to visitone thing i am going to throw out
apparently it is not
i do not want to i want to show up and sweep her off her feet to make a life together but to do so would be the epitome of selfishness we live 800 miles apart we both have successful careers we both have wonderful children who deserve parents who are present for them above all else more importantly i am pretty sure it would be an atrocity against her well being to even try
i wondered why suddenly but since i know her in person i accepted the request anyway minutes later i got a message on fb inbox from her thanking for following her page
i fucking hate that like i will never compare and be forever inadequate and settled for and lied to by my future so who still carries feelings for them makes me never want to date and just die alone
these modifiers create a not so unique mode of being settling on a bell curve or spectrum i like that i can trust you
it felt like my body was aching to be close to his
so in that theory i do love myself i do care for me
he transfers those pictures glimpses of it out onto the canvas and the whole image gets the true meaning
i 25f met my boyfriend 24m over a month ago he today asked me to be his girlfriend officially today
i wrote her a letter but that did not work too
john mccurdy at 102 received the first ever plaque awarded by the international united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners for his 80 years of union membership
she lied to me but i could not explain my feelings of fury because she retired the next year so i never had her instead i had mr c
aside from the small amount of light peeking in through the blinds
it is crazy to think two people broken by the same lover can find so much comfort and happiness in each other
she does not deserve this and it is impossible that right now we would work together our lives are just too different
your pain is the breaking of the she will that encloses your understanding logic will keep you alive but love will keep you living
i had buried my feelings so deep by then that i had not even mentioned her name in many years they came rushing back with a vengeance
be martin eden he pursued his passion and loved passionately he had fun all the time he enjoyed his money by spending it and giving away happily
every moment he can give me is a precious gift i have to let him come to me
when we apply beginners mind to our loved ones our environment and our workstudies we have a deeper appreciation for what we have and can live happier lives
of course i did vividly i thought to myself after you went to sleep she continued ______ another mutual friend raped me that night
today i saw an old couple in face masks walking down the road to the shops he pinched her bum and she giggled and swatted him away they both fell about laughing it was a beautiful and tender moment between two old folk that are young at heart
i feel loved very completely and it is a wonderful thing
never really is
working 2630 hours a week on top of maintaining low 90s after each day i am extremely drained as extroverted as i am i need that time alone
this love is so different than the whirlwinds i have found myself caught up in before
i saw a box for a tent next to the trash at the truck stop before i left for the day
we started talking and laughing almost instantly it made me super excited because i have always had these feelings for her
i guess maybe i have trust issues
we are all 1 of 1 we are all sacred
the other day he helped me with my anxiety and he reassures me we both see a future with each other and we are working together to build it
life is full of cycles and this one
within three or four months i was out i was a lesbian
i never understood why it took so long for her to come see me how could i was still a kid
it is true what they say love happens when you least expect it
this has just happened far too many times
you may be saying that it is impossible to dispel those nagging voices but that is the problem of what most people do
we fell in love with different people but at last after 6 years we kissed
update she is amazing she was so sweet and fun and beautiful i got to snuggle with her for basically three hours so it was lovely
we can reignite and restart whenever we like why not do it right now
the boy does not know what to do with himself i keep telling him be patient i will get you a new brother soon but words just are not cutting it
i am just sitting here crying about my ex and my dog is laying next to me in bed and my cat is in my lap
there is no real point to this post but as someone who endured some pretty heavy trauma from his previous relationship he wanted to take things slow with me i have been accommodating and understanding as i want to provide a space for him to heal while still being apart of his life i love this man in the purest sense of the word and it is been so sweet getting close to him
then the mind can access higher sense of reasoning and change the responsiveness altogetherjust as the animal kingdom shows us the example
my question was not argumentative i was genuinely inquiring
so what do you say you have my back and i have yours or really you scratch my back then i scratch yours
go for a meal with her family it is really nice and we spend the night there
i am not sure if i should tell him soon or if i should wait for a better time
i want to climb up to the roof tops and scream it to the world i want to tell it to you over and over again
we have both had bad relationships in the past and had both given up on finding partner
i miss you so much of cry to sleep on some nights because there is so much uncertainty i found you my love after some terrible relationships and i wish to hold on to you still
i am only 25 and already feel like i am wasting time i often do not know know how to cope with this feeling what should i do
i thought i could say no whenever but instead i kept helping them while continuing to seethe insidehopelessly expecting this person to realize how crappy they were
i am asking for your thoughts will this get better what should i do how do i deal with this sadness that is overwhelming me girls always expect us to be confident but i just can not be like that in this period of my life i want true love i do not give a f about sx
i have suffered from depression for 15 years and i feel like i want to come out of it and experience life i just need someone to be my cheerleader someone who can act as a mentor and be there for me if anyones interested please let me know

every part of him is precious to me i love who he is and it is so much more than just a feeling that can evaporate like water
he was finally in a peaceful home where everyone was just grateful to be in together
right now we are cuddling in the backseat of her car and she is laying on me falling asleep i love this girl so much she is so perfect
but you are not ready to hear it yet i do not want to scare you off
this is the true terror of a high school while you know it is insignificant in nature that it would not matter whether you grant it or not it still nudges at the sourest most tender depths of your heart
and yesterday while we were on the phone out of the blue he finally told me he loved me he said he finally felt it and it was the most wonderful thing to hear i have never been in a relationship before and to hear him say i love you was just so wonderful
he is so fucking sweet sending me messages trying his best to talk to me even tho it is crazy as hell at his work

if we can hate for no reason why can not we love instead httpsyoutuberhd_gay6ddchttpsyoutuberhd_gay6ddc
sadly though he notices that i am tired and starts playing super slow songs to make me fall asleep
a great attribute of what we possess it is what differentiates us from animals
the only good thing is the flexibility with school finishing school in 4 months
i do not know if we are ever going to see each other because we live miles away i miss him
i am not denying but i am not entirely accepting of it i have feint glimmers of memories but no entire memory i asked her for specifics so i could remember i then asked her how are you going to claim to not remember me except i was someone you went to school with but then remember i said some fcked up things never have i been argumentative with her every time i have spoken with her through messaging it is always been inquisitive
within the next 14 days i intend on making a drastic shift in my inner state and circumstances i am going to rise above my mind and be guided by my higher mind
comprehending the scale of the world
i tried then so hard tried everything i could to keep her at least until i come back so we can discuss and talk about things to find solution but i just felt like she became more and more distant
just us the beach the sun and the moon the best part is that we are going to a dream destination and i do not care
if you would just for a while create a different scenario in your head no matter how absurd it is they wronged me but it is fine
i found you my love after some terrible relationships and i wish to hold on to you still i will not let the virus get the better of us
i just want to be loved my girlfriend left me when she found out that i have been diagnosed with cancer
this weekend was the 18th anniversary of my grandmas death and she was the closest person to me and the only person before meeting my so that i had ever had truly unconditional love from
we begin the next chapter of our lives after several devastating losses we are now 5 months into a healthy albeit high risk pregnancy
the only thing that pulled me out of my rage and hatred was the largerthanlife person standing right in front of me the minute i crossed the threshold into his home
she never wanted to put herself out there and worst of all did not really believe in herself
i wrote your name in the sky but the wind blew it away i wrote your name in the sand but the waves washed it away i wrote your name in my heart and forever it will stay
i am so glad he took the time to understand me that is something i never thought i would find
maybe my expectations were too high or i thought it would be something else apparently it is not
happiness is a habitcultivate it elbert hubbard
i like the variety a is very philosophical and spiritual our conversations are deep and intense and very open he feels like someone i can step back from the world with and actually talk about real shit
you forgive his mistakes you reciprocate the goodness of him with a thousand times better demeanor and natural behavior and you build the foundations for the best impeccably beautiful moment that you wish it lasts forever taking your heart in heaven as mutual happiness is the perennial quest
my best friend also asked me that which slightly freaked me out how to bring our relationship to a healthier level
so i stopped hanging out with my friends now ten months later we are both out of our shitty 2020 relationships and hanging out again
and to think that the ability is only found in the self and independent of external variables i might be wrong but that is what i have been told
it was elbows to elbows in this restaurant the wait time was something like 45 minutes to an hour unless we wanted to sit at the bar
i tried everything i could thing of but just nothing tried making list of the things that i love about my self but i just can not write anything am just lost
they thought that we entered in someone else home so they were asking us questions

so my brother and his wife calls each other love and it absolutely warmed my heart when their twoyear old daughter called my sisinlaw love because it is what she kept hearing from the two of them it is too darn cute
i could argue about politics or my beliefs until i was blue in the face but now i keep my opinions and beliefs to myself
but in my opinion its not alla about butterflies well sometimes yeahand tense feelings its about understanding and supporting having fun and making the other person feel good that is what i believe and i am realizing
idk if you know the feeling when
recently my step brother has been asking about if i have a girlfriend more often my mom asked me if a girl was playing dumb just to talk to me in this case i know for a fact she was not and i have been told that i am conventionally speaking attractive
however because of you we could rush our father to the er and you saved his life
when i talk to him i feel like i am worth something like maybe there really is nothing wrong with me maybe i am not broken
it is an exaggerated situation of the stoic spirit of being content with whatever happens and not trying to change what is outside of our control
so that was a rollercoaster of horribleness
i am not sure my sof is still in love with me but i am wildly in love with them how do i bring this up without seeming like an asshole
tldr i think love requires no action and is simply a mode of being
you helped me in the process of buying a new car you got me to stop smoking and drinking
we will see face to face what i know now is not complete
it is asking are we ready to move on to the next level usually we force our own bad outcomes based on our own insecure desires based panicked fears driven decisions based on what a situation looks like or could potentially become and based on what actually is
i would hope that i would only get it when i think it is mutual otherwise having butterflies in my stomach as someone says they are not into me would be so devastating it is a gut reaction and your gut is usually right but i just want to prepare myself if rejection is still possible
never overthink and never try to compare yourself to the other but you do always rightbut the truth is never compare yourself to anyone because you are better in your own just the way you are all you have to do is just open your mind and see the worldit is just the way as it is because as houdini the greatest magician once said the doors are never locked they are always open for you
amen
i knew that she was probably the only person i did not want to hurt or because any harm to
that same day later in the evening we got into a deep conversation about each others feelings towards one another i knew she liked me and she knew i liked her as well
his varied career at the bbc eventually resulted in life on earth which set the high standard of quality and professionalism in wildlife filmmaking that generations of documentary filmmakers sought to emulate
it is what i look forward to to get through the week
the moment i knew you the hottest baddest muscled masculine man you handed me a tupperware of homemade cookies for me to take to work for my techs you knew we were about to pull an overnight job and you wanted them to have something nice i got to say my boyfriend made cookies for you and they were delicious
i am here my capacity of love was not ruined i am terrified but ecstatic i can not tell him yet but for now i will rejoice in feeling human again
he is unbelievable i can not believe i am so lucky to have met him and to have fallen in love with him so fast
listen here
to the time that i could think of nothing but her and rejected some dates because i wanted her
i broke down and wanted a simple talk on the phone like how we did when we meet she lead me on a goose chase after work that she will call later but later turned to never with a believable excuse
she told me to enjoy my own company she told me all such things that indicate me that i was just forcing her
my partner had a breast reduction recently she had to stay in the hospital overnight
it starts in the pit of my chest and it radiates to the tips of my fingers and toes until the excitement just has to escape from my body
did not want to get back together but that i hope we can be friends
he did and i felt everything like i had been struck by lightning i had fallen head over heels in only a week
it is still really hard not to
all because you perceived and changed the situation in your head it is as simple as that
this post is dedicated to the love of my life she is not a redditor and the trivial life lesson for all of you
i am grateful for the time i spent in the military and the benefits i have received because of what i have accomplished
my initial instinct was to stick to my patriotism at the time which was england is gods gracious we are number one we are not racist which is true to some extent
i can get kind of moody especially when i feel bad about myself or i am hungry both of which happen often and i cry so much but he is always there for me always there to comfort me and make me feel better
i love how we heal together moving forward in consciousness in strides loving to learn creative and how you are willing to truly love me in all my glorious flaws
your objectives should not change because yesterday you were confident it will work but today you are kind of reluctant about it just because of an assumed hinderance

drop the violence go and talk
6 do you think you work to live or you live to work7 do you think that the economic growth of a country determines its happiness
i know it is stupid but i feel like that 3rd friend
i want to be happy in this crazy world so i do not talk about moon beams with the blind music with the deaf and under no circumstances talk about sex with a eunuch it only pisses them off
when we reached my stop my cousin whispered say bye to him before you leave i shook my head no and got my things ready and fixed my hair and bag before the train stopped i when the door opened i felt him watch me as i turned to face him i waved bye and he waved back that was the first and probably the last time i will see him
which is preposterous because if that were the case i would have been arrested and taken in for attempted murder
it was a summer night at around 1am
her joy at seeing them was unbounded
and if you can not stop prizing a lot of other things then you will never be freefree independent imperturbable because you will always be envious and jealous afraid that people might come and take it all away from you
i know you will read this eventually love i miss you 3
got something from that phrase no well here is nothing to this just keep following one path of your dreams and discover the other paths when you reach the end
my so did something that i never received before he listened to me as i talked about my process and how i could potentially provide a solution
it was incredibly self obsessed but it left it open for p to get in touch with me when she was ready and that i would not contact her

at the time i was already in relationship with girl a but slowly me and girl b started becoming friends
regaining control of your own world is one of the key steps to achieve a happy life and it sounds cheesy but you are the captain of your own ship not just physicaly but also mentaly
this love is so different than the whirlwinds i have found myself caught up in before i have never felt like i have lost myself or sense of direction with them
every night we used to facetime with the group and once everyone left and it was only us we would have deep conversations about our love for each other and our future
you got better excersizing again dieting like you used to smiling joking laughing making friends you were quickly becoming the person i remembered
his name was sean he was on a work visa from scotland
for some reason that makes me feel sad and left out i really do not know what it is about me
and i had this lastditch plan that said why do not i try the idea of gratitude daily for 365 days and i would video and document my journey
i hope you believe in the future
i have a problem a terrible problem

about 2 months ago she broke up because she did not love me and said the spark had faded for her obviously i was devastated but we decided to remain friends and keep contact since we still cared deeply for eachother
i am aware that you are not wanting fuss that you are not have not been especially looking forward to today i counter and reject this with fuss and reasons to celebrate and be happy that is right i dan will now attempt optimism
focus on it and organize in order to carry it outthe beginning is also part of the process as much as the end product
it was not aimed at me but it was in the comment thread and today when i looked for it it had been taken down
i feel safe to talk to you and be who i truly amyou make me better supporting me through my times of need
i love you more with every heartbeat
these negative thoughts always creep up on mewhy can not this man see how much i truly care about him
hard to pay if something happens to youdo you have anything else to add
again i would recommend meditation as a tool to let things go
that leads to awkward moments when she sometimes asks me if i love her i have never met a girl that is so kind patient and lovely
people tell me that i should stop looking for love
the third thing concerns freedom from deception and rashness in judgement and generally it concerns the assents
i have been thinking about reality alot the world perception mater the mind
remember you know positivity because of negativity
but then again he is also strong and protective over me and is very comforting as well and is always there when i need him

i have also processed the realisation that i do not believe anyone has loved me with the same unconditional deep intense love like he did i think as we never dated his love for me remains untainted with complexity relationship drama and other difficultiesit remains pure and untouched
yet this is turned into something difficult by the madness that is universal among men we push one another into vices and how can people be called back to spiritual wellbeing when no one is trying to hold them back and the crowd is urging them on
since we have known each other for a long time i know that when she is with family and her really close friends she is really emotionless most of the time no one has really questioned it but i am guessing its bc of exhaustion of interacting with ppl or its just a mask she uses to hide the fact that she is a robot

i am doing an interview for school and i have 5 questions for you1 what has been the most challenging time of your relationship
fellow redditors how do you define love
yes boorish people do boorish things
how can we expect others to love us immensely and unconditionally if we do not even try to love ourselves that way we spend so much time and energy focusing on being loved by others have you asked yourself if maybe you are craving your own love
so when you say you love someone will you have to add for now to be 100 honest
sure i know it is possible that people i would rather not know my business could read it but i do not care
you do not love me yet you say you would be surprised if i said it first
in any of those endeavors i wish us well in our actions to be that much more peaceful and happier
i am so thankful for you for us

fall in love with someone who takes the time to remember how you like your coffee in the morning someone who just picks up on your energy because they have made the effort to dive into the depth of it
it reminds me of silence of the lambs you are putting on the skins of me and other people who have been in my life

i would drive to the airport just park and look at the stars while we talked we talked about our high school days
as a child inquires about god or religion were typically dismissed or met with a scientific explanation as a result after beginning to date my now wife i realized how damaging it actually was growing up without faith the inability to change how i thought about the grand scheme of the universe or life itself
today i interview lionel wilson lionel helps clients and business owners overcome the frustration of not living their potential he teaches people to take control over their life and discover the greatness within he does this by coaching them to understand how their mind works and helps them to understand how to live from the inside out rather than letting outside circumstances determine their success

long distance is so hard not our first time apart we have been doing long distance for awhile now

the true happiness is the result of the minimization of the suffering happiness is not a goal is a result a return you reap what you sow
when you have plenty of options to date but you focus on your studies instead of dating to avoid any potential distractions
perhaps in these scenarios he would lost his temper became depressed or stopped checking in with himself

we had known each other and were friends for about 8 months before quarantine but never got to know each super well until quarantine

but it fucking sucks it hurts having to become distant
i was not happy about it but definitely not sad
i really love the way he makes me feel but i do not like him at all
i thought i had fallen for him to be honest i was always watching and rewatching our videos that we filmed togheter just being funny
i am not familiar with the term romantic feelings i have heard it before but can not say i ever experienced them i have been infatuated with others before and i am currently with my girlfriend of 6months and can confidently say that i love her in my experience it is not a feeling it is a collection of other feelingsmost important of all being happy
it was the way she emphasized the wrong syllables when she spoke with her accent which i loved it was the way she thought of me throughout the day
but i fall in love too easily
it can be learned it can do anything
so we have been rlly busy with school so we have not been able to see each other in a long time and i really miss him
i wish i was a better man who did not leave her alone with a rapist who did not put my own desire to be loved before her mental health who did not leave her and our friendship behind when she could have really used a friend like i was someone safe and caring and unselfish someone who does not leave
it is so hard because with the breakup she just does not understand that i needed a reality check and i am so certain how perfect we would be now
he was stuck in my head but something felt off i felt that if he left i would not be so sad about it like the first boyfriend
i did not know how to respond because it caught me off guard but then i started to wonder was she asking me this because she had an interest in me was this her way of objecting to my relationship with someone else at the time when i was young and dumb i could not and still can not take hints or signs
running most powerful for the mind and weightlifting for a quality body showing appreciation for small things eg cashier handling my purchases
i came to the conclusion that i am not truly happy nor was i ever
but i should not divulge my whole self into them when it is not properly reciprocated in fact it is a serious thing to consider

though they are a person who greatly values their privacy they are always willing to open up about their life and experiences whenever i ask
this experience is familiar to me it has happened before with my first boyfriend
she looks at me when we enter our school
i was destroyed i could not feel anymore people i once was attracted to now had a slew of problems and baggage and i felt like for the first time in my life i could see everyone would always just hurt me i lost the spark physically existing with someone felt like my head was under water no one felt like they fit with me and i felt alone
i never heard from him again
i posted to rthexeffect my wall which has motivation is often the result if action not the because as a part of a community it can be very difficult to find your identity or validation there within
i wish i could never feel the venom of love ever again
we have been friends for quite a long time ngl 34 years i think and we have never been much more than that tbh
all i want is everything any true human desires
other times she just wonders if something is wrong with her to feel so strongly about it how can she attach feelings and emotions to an object because that is precisely what it is
she has been dedicated to the centre ever since volunteering she says very rewarding
so back in early november i met this girl on an highly relevant app and i commented on their post and they saw it
all my foster brothers were imposing but even when they were all in the same room the one that stuck out most was him alexander
he is a very logical person so i am trying to convince him but i can not seem to think of a good enough reason besides can not you just do it for me because you love me because he can use that same excuse
how i was happy and that the medication was doing so much it also thanked her
furthermore though you should be attracted to one another
but together
it will be 7 months in 3 days and i have never felt so much for another person like i feel for her sometimes i can not contain how much i love and i just want to tell someone but it is such a struggle to hold it in and be content with her knowing how much i love her i can not do it anymore
iva surprised herself by running almost all the way in the marathon and making it to the finish line for which she was honored with a point of light award

i have date ideas already planned out that i think we would both like
he is so unbelievably smart and we have the same sense of humor but he is way funnier he also is the most caring and thoughtful person i have ever met
we are long distance right now and he still manages to make me this giddy and head over heels the thought alone of seeing him in person again gives me feelings i can not even explain or describe
he followed that with a text that said it is interesting how common this is and it has become the standard to block out of respect as it always should be if you do not respect that person its apparent you would not as in that is the obvious choice obviously this was a problem in our relationship as he took it upon himself to block 30 people including relatives without my consent because he was jealous
his talentwith five primetime emmy awards one tony and an academy award best supporting actor nomination so far to his namewill continue to dazzle us no doubt
and it is been heaven even the hard parts i would do over again in a second
i slowly started to reciprocate feelings but i remember feeling nervous about letting my guard down with only a few months left in country

id always make time to call and text her and she always stayed up late to text me good morning or goodnight

a lot of older people say that your highschool relationship is not going to last long is that true will i not love her after some time will she not love me after some time is something inevitable going to seperate us and we will move on to find a replacement that is just as good as us i do not want a replacement i want her

it is not buying you an expensive 100 dinner it is noticing your bottle is empty and refilling it with warm water the way you like it it is eating your carbs and giving you my protein because i know you like it and that you are worried about your weight even though i think you are the most beautiful person i have come to know and that i wish i could tell you everyday that you are beautiful to me
we might encounter failure and rejection need to deal with unfriendly or problematic people plans goes wrong or work at a job that we do not like these bad situations and events prevent us from feeling the happiness and the fulfillment and their memory affects our mind in the long term afterward

when one of her daughters wanted to attend college lois worked as both a hospital nurses aide and assisted in doctors offices to help pay for the tuition
should not everyone have the right to the pursuit of happiness and yet metal illness trauma and war threaten to take this away from us

there is no need to feel resentment toward themin fact you should look out for their wellbeing and be gentle with thembut keep in mind that everything you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind

1 i have learned that people will forget what you said people will forget what you did but people will never forget how you made them feel
i did not care if she bought me things the fact that i crossed her mind was enough for me
she was so beautiful and i could immediately tell that this was someone i would want to invest my time into
during my 6 year marriage it felt at times like i was more a care taker than a husband her anxiety seemed to be focused on me and our relationship
should i tell her how i feel about her and if i do i am afraid of what if she does not like me back or anything
someone perfectly imperfect will come along in my life so why am i in a rush for it if these people come and go in my life they are only temporary and i need to learn the art of letting go
edit well she said no but it is okay she said that she wanted to stay friends but she thought we did not text all too often in the last few months and said that we should text more frequently so i think that is a win
i get sad about this and so i leave it
i told her that she loved me and she was so shocked that she shyly admitted to it and then really admitted to it
i certainly was not engaged but when dad started to get really sick we decided to have a daddydaughter dance
so all things considered do not we at times sacrifice beings and principles of love for objects of lovelife cannot be freed of challenges trials and tribulations

she unexpectedly came as well catching a ride from albany with her ex i was already there and setting up my tent when they arrived
walking around a very busy borough market i hoped to find cakes that would heal the woundbeing among all those tourists and food lovers made feel somehow alienated and detached
i kissed her we have hung out a couple times since the change in our dynamic and though we have only kissed a couple times the spark i missed so damn much from over a decade ago came back but it was not a spark it was a whole freaking fireworks show it was my own personal concert playing at their best i have never had a kiss in my life feel like it just was perfect
we see how happiness arises naturally once we still the mind this is also helpful in developing and refining concentration
try to understand the person next to you do not think always that you are right
has anyone ever been in a situation like me how did it turn out
a year later i confessed as we were graduating they liked me too for a while
sometimes i wake up in the morning and have to pinch myself i can not believe i am so lucky
people think that happiness will come sometime in the future when some event happens maybe it is a holiday when they finish school when they finish college when they start working when they get married when they have kids when they retire when they get a promotion when they get more money the list goes on
hearing them talk about what they wear and their favorite scents almost made me feel like a 12 year old that only wears body spray on occasion

i wanted this post to launch a discussion on what love is what it means to you and how you rationalize love between objects family and nonfamilial members
i have spent four years with my walls up so high that they were impossible to climb this time they were patient
i did not realize how much love could brighten up my world i think i understand what the love songs on the radio are talking about now
i am embarrassed to admit it but i have been in love with a fictional character i know i sound like a naïve idiot but it is the truth
for some people the illusion continues from childhood to death always chasing something that they think will make them happy only to achieve it and decide it must be something else that makes them happy

probably already has and moved on she is that type
for me she is talkative downtoearth and athletic she is really funny and has a dark sense of humor she has fierce eyebrows and sharp facial features and her wavy auburn hair is the color of deep red autumn leaves she is fit and feisty and her movements are swift and lithe she is like a hunter goddess the pure image of fierce feminine beauty
