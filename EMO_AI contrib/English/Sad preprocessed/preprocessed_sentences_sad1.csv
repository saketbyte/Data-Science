lockdown made me realize how lonely i have been i have never had a serious relationship all were just too casual some even hookups
only reason i did not do it today was to not ruin christmas for my little siblings he even asked for a quickie and i said no

i have never had a girlfriend and the lack of intimacy is taking it is toll on me i just did not realize it mattered that much but it happens randomly
i went to work the next day acted as if it never happened but i could feel the throbbing pain of the slits on my wrists every time i did something
i just really wanted to tell him that i loved him the whole time but just would have make things harder for both of us

for background they say nothing has ever happened between them she says he is like a little brother and i have even hung out with her several times without him and it was fun
i see my dad maybe 3 times a year but sometimes i just find that too much it destroys my mental health being around her
i know now that i need to clean up my act and just look to have fun with friends and a meetup group and not care about sex and intimacy so much i let so much of my life pass me by and regret it so much
i am scared i am heading back down the rabbit hole after beating 3 years of struggle any advice would be greatly appreciated
we broke up after the second time she had been telling me for months she had lost the feelings the once had
we had really good sex and he was honestly one of the first guys i experienced real passionate and intimate sex with

so today is christmas eve is the first after a 9 year relationship and 2 children breakup and despite my ex had invited me to spend the evening with her and the children i just can not take it anymore
i miss having sex i still love my ex but any possibility of us ever getting back together is not going to happen
and i feel like hes smiling not visible like 67 feel like hes just part of meso from that day my life is like pain game never ends
i know this seems obvious but i have really thought that a lot of the times especially online i do not want to reach out because i think they will not like me or sometimes i never get around to answering again because i do not see how it is worth the effort which is terrible that i leave most people on read for all eternity
and i know that this might not be a text that you want right now and maybe even i am blocked but i need to be selfish one last time
it makes me feel physically sick i have done nothing but try and try to find people for years and years and nothing

as soon as i came up the stairs he immediately hung up his call i confronted him about it and he said it was his friend but would not say who i freaked out and had another breakdown and broke his phone and our tv that i bought while i lived there and his mirror
i do not know if this is part of her mental health issues or she is just annoying but she talks 247 if she is awake she is talking usually you can not get a word in edgewise like i have tried sometimes and it can take up to five minutes to manage to squeeze something in

for me christmas used to be one day out of the year where i could tolerate my family after my mom died 2 years ago its never been the same
i have not talked to her since the breakup but she said she still wanted me to be her friend but my dream last night showed me why i could not
and i do not want to be this person and i just want to shut the world out to protect myself and to protect the world from me
it is true when people say it gets better with time it does and everyone that is going through a heartbreak just know you are not alone even if it feels like it there are amazing people on reddit that will stand by you while you go down this path and things really do get better if you let them take care wonderful people of reddit you guys are appreciated
someone whgos not in my country i am really interested to told youits kind of short story are you interested its may help you futher
the empty cruelty of how working class folk like me are treated how we have no control over our own lives is inescapable in any career path i can take
and today i accidentally said the same thing and said i really enjoyed her companyfuck worried i am annoying cuz i been smoking a lot and maybe my memory is not the best cringe
i wish i could be happy with being by myself and stop overthinking about other people all the time but i try so hard to talk to people and i always feel like they just do not want to see or talk to me and it hurts so much i can feel it in my chest it is such a heavy feeling
i would not care in the least bit of time because my girlfriend would make me forget how time passed i hurt you for three years i loved you and one year i hated you
i am not sure if it is a prerequisite to be damaged in one way or another to be able to connect with another human being on such a profound level as we did
ignore me act like i do not exist and do not need help i stayed in a failing relationship for about a month and a half after that
i want to leave my head i can not feel emotions like i should i can feel certain emotions but when i am not feeling mad or sad the two things left that i feel inside its like i am empty when i should be happy or exited about something i have a sense of humour but its always so temporary
so all i can do is cry i repeatedly tell myself i am not good enoughi met him on my 1st session of my classit started with his heyy i said him too
i initiated no contact and it feels good for once to have control over it it feels good that i am the one who gets to say whether we talk or not
lately i have becoming more worn and tired from everything i can not get some school requirements done on time i can not focus on my studies without being distracted and addicted to whatever videogame i am playing
i will just do that to try and prove that i am awesome and that i am smart and that i am someone who will succeed but that is so hard when you just want to be loved by somebody
it triggered so many awful feelings in me and it felt like she had betrayed me in a way that she could never have done otherwise
what is weird is that i understood that they were talking about the uk i understood each piece of information as a standalone and i took a good look at the post it was a photo but i failed to make the connection of how unusual the architecture would be for an american city and other things
i was of course scared and excited i liked their company because i could actually finally find someone i could relate a bit more
because i am so sure we changed you even became my friend then you just change your mind the next minute and act like nothing happened
in her mind she believed i would never find out her secret plot to replace me with a rebound but i did
anyways i am done with life i have seen people happier without me around and i know deep down no one will care if i die i have not tried again recently bc i do not want to ruin the holidays for my family if it works
she did not keep her word and i feel almost tricked by her she is the same only without the physical abuse probably considering the mess the previous abuse put her through
how do i know what i want i know what i want right now but what the fuck do i want
but i really just do not want to be here anymore the place i live is such hellkintsugi is the japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending broken pieces with dusted gold silver or platinum
hold on if you need someone to talk to you need some advice or some support we are right here everyone needs help we are all in it together so do not worry about being judged or anything cuz we do not that kind of crap here all the best friend never forget that you are freaking awesome
i think maybe as a kid my parents had money but they refused to spend it on me for items they would consider aesthetic and i would go to school and be the boy in ugly and torn tracksuits
for me that means that i would have to sacrifice what i believe in to fit the needs of guys and i have done that way too much for guys who could not care less about me
he was feeling really depressed and was drunk which adds to those feelings and had his gun with him but as far as we know right now he did not actually shoot himself though there is still a potential for it still being suicide
i have felt disconnected with myself ever since taking the acid my surroundings seem distorted and so do sounds and depth perception
like you are being tortured for being a true lover an honest one about how you feel and appreciate things that they used to give you
but i am tired of trying to pick myself up there does not seem to be any point in doing something better i stare at a wall and then at night i close my eyes and no more tears come out i am already buried with such hopelessness with each passing day i am not wanting to die because i know we all go someday
kissing was as far as i have ever gone with a guy before i met him he is the first i ever really trusted and felt comfortable with to do anything
i am a 14y bisexuel guy and i only felt pain for the last 2 years i have everyday a fight with my parents who are homophobic i have fake friends games do not entertain me more and i now on my age already i have a drinking problem and i tryd already 2 thimes and do not know how i could stop myself from ending it al any longer
is there anyone who shares the same experiences how did you come over ghostingdid you ever realise how to retain a friendly relationship
i came out of a long term relationship into this one quickly that was ok we were not meant to be and it needed to finish opened my heart and fell in love with him i loved hard really hard and deeply
but i deleted all of the pictures and the fact that i do not feel the need to check her socials feels great
he does not believe covid19 is real i cry when i watch our shows still there were good times but also pretty bad times too
emotional hurt definition is psychological pain mental pain emotional pain is an unpleasant feeling i am so confused i have no idea why he would end it
i could find some random career path and get good enough to earn a living but the thought of becoming trapped in a job makes me panic
this person who i love so so much who i write fucking letters for who i would die over left me because we fought too much
i knew i was not alone in that moment it was entirely him but the scientist in me had to prove it by removing my one variable
i saw the aftermath of more suicides than i care to count he ended up coming over and we had sex he spent the night
he said that he as a virgin deserved to have that special experience and had his first time with a virgin but if he would had sex before he would be okay with someone who would also had sex beforebecause they were even
i need that person to love me and i thought it was you but you were just a lesson for me
leading me into a situation for the past ten days or so that has me contemplating very strongly not romantically but as a person
which is totally fucking insanemy mom died last yearmy dad has brain damagedementia i remember waiting outside covid isolation ward not knowing what was happening seeing so many patients dying
crosses street leaving me behind and then brings up regularly how stupid it is that i expressed the desire for my partner to cross the street with me
i never thought i would see the day where i would be unusually calm to see him move on from me but i am
i am asking this because my ex wanted to remain friends and said during our breakup and said that i was still the only guy she wanted but has been acting hot and cold ever since i broke out two weeks no contact she said she was meaning to contact me again so i do not think she was mad about me breaking it any ideas
she was adamant that they were madly in love and they have been together since january finding the light so to speak and residing within the positivity of that adaptation
there was so much food for 4 people i ate one tiny brownie and it made me want to kill myself
and there is such a shame attached to it too which makes it feel worse i can not explain the shitty feeling i feel i do not know who i am i have 0 self worth
it feels like a boulder in my chest and i hope i am not just being over dramatic or crazy almost like if i was doing something bad
i can not kill myself because it would hurt many people and i am just too scared to but i think about it constantly
and this is my offer to youyou do not realise how toxic a relationship is until you have room to breathe from them
used to think i was smart since i could get straight as without even trying in like math and physics and stuff but now i have started 2nd grade in gymnasium i think it would be like 11th or 12th grade in the us and ever since i have just felt stupid unable to push myself to study unable to focus
my sister is toxic but i have trouble saying that because she is 12 and i am older than her she is twelve but she does not really act like she is any younger than us
i am choice f in case choices a b c d and e fail i am that extra in the group pic that obviously does not belong
i do really well functioning top grades in college with several involvements i have gotten promoted multiple times at work in several years have my life together financially
why can not i just admit it like a normal person why is the anxiety so great but it was too little too late
not very long after another girl practically skipped over to me in the hallway to introduce herself out of nowhere because apparently i looked depressed lmao no shit and that was the beginning of the first genuinely supportive classmate friendship i can remember
consistent in gym and reading books has a lot of known people i do not consider them as real friends though because i know they just hangout for something but still have this close inner circle of three which includes two of my childhood friends but lives in another city
weeks went by and on a certain point my ex wanted to see me more often we started hanging out more and started sleeping with each other i always noticed lisas clothes but he told me not to worry
i do not want him to find someone else i do not want to have to accept the reality of him moving on
i lost alot of things in my life starting from wealth friends popularity and much morewhen did the important question become why we should help them instead of what can help them
i am just still in a lot of pain my issue is that i just can not find it within me to seek help
my discovery of what my problem was yesterday left me very empty and sad i wonder how i would get back after wasting my youth over something i created for myself i am 23 now
i tried to kill myself in july but i decided not to at the last moment but now here in december i am going back into the same mindset
i do not know what to think anymore are these feelings valid and understandable or am i just pouting thank you for any input
i have never approached them in a sexual manner i do have a dark sense of humor but that is as far as it goes i just feel defeated in trying to make more friends and i also feel like a piece of shit for making them feel the way that they do i just feel like i am better off alone
suicide is my only option a homeless shelter is not they do not get me to a place to earn a living and then my own apt
i found myself scouring through all of his pictures trying to see if he was online on friday saturday date nights trying to see if his latest new friend was a hot chick and if there were any postings or activities from an attractive female
posted yesterday asking for help and got it but today was much worse than yesterday i spent half an hour earlier holding a knife in my room i do not feel comfortable venting publicly
as the title says my life feels meaningless i have suffered from anxiety and depression since i was around 1011 when my parents got divorced it was then i think i cemented my avoidance behaviours because it meant that whatever assignment or issue i was facing could just be swept under the rug for a while
so again my question is if it possible for anxiety to feel normal and does anybody else feel this way as well
without the lows we would never know when we are happy without the highs we would never know when we are feeling down and know that something must be changed
i have tried to get insurance which i thought i had but what they gave me does not cover mental health
anything that condones suicide even passively encourages suicide it is not supportive and does not help it also violates reddits sitewide rules as well as our guidelines explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions
this is possibly the best day of my life i feel like there are repercussions for when i feel good or get through something easily
a little kid who had to call an ambulance for my own mother a little kid who just wants a fucking hug
but i do need to isolate myself i need to be completely away from everyone because everybody is tiring me out when i am already so worn out from these years of suffering
as for happiness can not even remember last time i thought to myself that i felt happy infact she contacted him to get back in touch
and there are many many disorders and all themselves are really complex much more complex than the diagnosing criterias can express
but he did move my furniture out for me i care about himi eat a lot when i am depressed i wish i was the kind to not be able to eat
i do not like pain and i do not want to die i am scared of dying he has my letter he has my words
do i have to live like this until the end of 2021 it is sad to see so many people in my country are fine with this like i do not see any sad people or any rants with living like this
it kind of seems like everyone is moved on i could die tomorrow no one would noticei bought a piano in june tried to learn it
how would i go about getting my records would they still even have them is that something they just give to people i know normal records are pretty easy to get but i do not know how it works with mental health
basically giving myself hope where it does not belong because she does not wantlong distance relationship and who can blame her i am pissed at the fact i am pissed
music i find is a good medium to help remedy my emotions that seem to come by and take down the built structures of good habits i have made over time
my father is a paranoid schizophrenic man in his 50s he was afflicted by the disease when i was a kid about 11 yo
however i was not responsive or interactive whatsoever if i remember precisely it must be the result of the midterm exams
in the middle of the night new englands winter night cold i went to the first place i found cheap ass crapy motel in the border of the city
always been an introvert as a kid with a bit of anxiety and the occasional nocturnal panic attack and suicidal thoughts at a young age
i have not showered in two weeks because every time i go to the hot water is gone or someone has to shit or they need to do laundry right that minute
we always told each other always and forever i wanted to be her husband the pain is not unbearable i know things will get better but here is the thing
but i have yet to decide what books to read and which podcast to follow so if you have any recommendations please let me know below
why does it get me mad and why do i still care so muchex m27 and i f25 dated for 4
whenever i saw eternal sunshine of a spotless mind i could not understand why someone would want to erase someone they loved out of their mind
the saddest part is i feel i have a purpose but now i am starting to not give a shit what is the fucking point
but another part of me feels really betrayed and frustrated that she put me on a timeline of falling in love and being 100 open about trauma
her grandmother mother is an old fashioned southern matriarch that thinks boys lead to eternal damnation this is why i cherish our phone calls and minecraft dates
i am over him but i am not over it and this week i thought to myself i am ready to meet someone else and i knew i meant it
i just miss my family but i am stuck at home because of covid and living in a different state i live alone and feel just awful today i do not know why we keep pretending like things will be okay because they never will be i am just doomed to work every day until i diei do not see the point in any of this nothing ever makes me happy i just feel like a black hole
why make all of these plans with me if you know you wanted to break up why spend all of this extra time with me if you felt like our relationship needed to end i feel like i was a waste of fucking time
you might not know them or they might not even care what you have to say you just want someone to talk to when the opportunity arrives
i hope one day she learns that she can not trust everything someone says to her because it will ultimately be her downfall
anyway the reason i bring this up is because my last breakdown was a bit more than a year ago and i am low key shitting myself because i thought the last ones were bad this is like 13 maybe 14 months of built up anger sadness etc and especially with how 2020 went and me having my own personal stuff i can not even imagine how bad this will be
she believes everything people tells her too much and that is one of her weaknesses i told her she does not know what love is and she agreed with me because i was right
i tried to convince them that it is bad to not get help but they still even today think that we are both just lazy and make things up
i am a chronically lonely depressed and very ugly 34year old man who has sought to always do good to others live life to the fullest and so on however i am still haunted by certain experiences in my childhood two in particular keep coming back to me i can become suicidal just thinking about them
does anybody else have family that seems to always be analyzing whatever you are doing and always has to make comments about it
which on good days can be described as an icepick twisting in my hip and a baseball bat smashing into my back
i am fine by myself till it hits me when small interaction happens to me with anyone in the internet not even in real life i feel happy
if i feel so detached and unable to connect with others then why am i even here i wish i could find out
i do not have any desire to go start a relationship make any new friends or put myself out there in any way because i am exhausted and i feel like any time i do that it is disingenuous and i am forcing myself
i just need help to get me through this phasei am making money now on my own time and going to save up and move somewhere beautiful
i just think i am worthless no matter how i put it i am almost 30 still live in my parents in law apartment because i am just stupid
i wish i would know how to care without being involved where me being alone does not point to me being lonely or maybe just arrogant but me just being at peace
i wish i did not get flashes and anxiety attacks from coming outi wish i was able to carry myself in the way i am in my head
i know he has pridecommunication issues so i gave him a speech following the most recent breakup on picking people that challenge him to put his pride aside to work on it
i do not know his knifes and the knife was fine for sure i was angry about it and stopped talking for a bit
hi its been a week since my ex broke up with me and yesterday he came to give me back my stuff i left at his house we were crying like babies his eyes were full of tears and looked me in the eye telling me that he loves me like crazy
as i get older i also fee depressionanxiety start to set in my overthinking thoughts are becoming more rapid i am having mental breakdowns
i have tried to make and maintain relationships with others in the past despite myself but everyone always just drifts the fuck away like i was just shit on the soles of their boots
and as for andrew he is doing just fine he has a clear plan for life friends and he will probably soon go to live abroad
i grew up in a military family moving every three years until i got in japan and stayed there for 7 years everyone there bullied me i had a few friends but i barely talked and kids woukd just run from me
i have some close friends and i am more than glad to have them to have somebody to talk to that cares
i ask myself what ifs why did this have to take place when will i stop hurting how am i heartbroken and he seems like he handling it better i feel disgusting sometimes i had his love only and i have given him mine never would i have thought he would be running away and all of this led to heartache and you not being here
i have not selfed harm in nearly 3 years i fucked up tonight i took too many drugs too many marks on my body i am alive do not worry
i have tried and i have tried and i assure you it does not work and i am tired of hearing it if i did not have family and friends waiting for me if the pandemic ends i would probably kill myself now
why is it that during holidays i feel lonelier than ever why can not i be happy just like everybody else i am stuck just stuck in this spiral the dark thoughts have not stopped losing more and more of me every single day i am so tired
it is all i can do but i think i have become a little paranoid and would check his messages or posts if something was off
so with all of this i am thinking of just needing space away from him and honestly just cutting our relationship off entirely but if i do that do i mention that i went through his phone and tell him what i saw do i even need to give him a reason am i being selfishtoxic
i told him no anyways because i knew he was unstable but i was a bit excited maybe once he got better we could give it a go
i told him i needed reassurance sometimes and that i still wanted to see him so i would respect his time
after some time apart we both broke nocontact on a few occasions because we really missed eachother but i do not know this for sure so who am i to assume
obviously i was and still am an absolute wreck i would have helped them through anything had they given me the chance but their mind was already made up this is not my first breakup but i am definitely trying to expedite the healing process as much as i can which is proving challenging during a global pandemic
my life is meaningless and i will be forgotten i am nothing i am no one i am not useful i am not skilled in any way
i just can not do this after witnessing the devastating effects on both my mother and everyone in her life but it seems i am just going to have to figure all of it out
or was it because she did not want to explain to our mutual friend that we are not talking anymore i have not seen or talked to the mutual friend in months as they were friends 1st and they are close the mutual friend would have almost certainly suggested giving me some and it could have just been easier to drop the box off then to talk to her about it
did you really want to continue the rest of your life being with someone that only cared bout your love and attention rather than caring about you
how do people have friends literally what are the dynamics i do not even think i understand the concept anymore i am feeling good except for whenever she appears in my dreams
at first we were friends and then we started a relationship and things were great then things started to get toxic
he calls if he is around my house not to see me but just to chat he admits to think of me every time he passes by too
i am a whole new person honestly i do not recognize myself at all i feel like i am watching a movie or something
i have never once been in an actual relationship where i was treated well and every time i think i have found the perfect person they just find someone else anyways
these are all good reasons rather reasonable to fall in lovewhen you truly love someone you will find no reason behind it
of course empty room was not empty i just mean i was by myself it also meant starcraft or league or chess or something that interested me with cool music so that helped to soothe the effect a bit however obviously that scenario was absurd
my mother hated my wife and mother inlaw she resented me for not being there to help with my father yeah fuck you too bitch when he first took ill mm she made no secret of that in how she treated me
but on the other hand i do not think i can endure this torture for them either that was not the first ending i got so at least that is good right
i just feel anxious around them and i try to avoid talking to them the problem is i want too move but financially it is so hard and mentally it is too
and it has been so hard i have gone through so many emotions in the past few daysi was just thinking
so i just told her to cut contact with me until she decides but that i will not wait for her she told me that in the future we will be together
i also feel like i am can not be fully comfortable around them just being me like i am waiting for them to go to bed or to work so i can fully relax and let go
keep in mind that i have never resulted in violence with people who were not clearly mocking me or looking for a fight
i guess this is kind of an update idk she sent me a merry christmas voice message and i have not checked the log yet
i do not hav anything on this fucking world to care about and does not seem tô be something after all this life
i have a counselor who i only tell a slight amount of info about my loneliness to over fear of them telling my parents i have been prescribed antidepressants but i have not taken them in months
he told me how he did not like how she is living this pretentious life and that was one of the reasons they broke up
please delete this post if it is completely out of place but over the last couple of months i have been looking into one of the big issues that is going to affect our gen z and gen y loneliness
the days i spent with her were the best i had in a long time i finally found hope in love and with a person with whom i could talk to about anything
as new years is approaching i am reminded how much of a failure i am this time last year i wanted nothing else but to quit my job and after 12 months i am still stuck in it
with a simple google search you can pull up lots of useful resources the book mind over mood by padesky is a commonly recommended resource and a staple at most libraries
my dad died almost 3 years ago now everyone talks about how they miss him but at the same time i do not feel anything like that all my memories with him are just a big blur
firstly i am aware you are not professionals i am sharing what i feel in hopes of finding people who are diagnosed and who experienced these symptoms so that i can learn more about it if i could afford a psychiatrist therapist or go see a counselor my school does not have one i would
well my boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me more like he kind of made up a situation where i had to ask for a break and instead of sorting it out he considered that we were done for this was on august though
so i have stopped watching them both since the start of lockdown and overall it is helped me a lot i have only been watching the comedy series like friends modern family etc
what can i do so i can pay less attention i have been trying my best to just focus on other things but it is been hard it is like i just can not stop thinking and feeling it
one day while we were having a casual conversation she decided to end the relationship in order to work on her eating disorder
i am so upset that it took us breaking up for me to realize it too because she definitely thought i was her dream guy
and even though i have experienced the same thing i have no idea what to do and how to handle this situation
one day i finally asked him very very gently if he could please talk to me instead i was losing him and if we did not then i know i would be nothing to him within a week
please understand that your ex has not become a different person and if you both had the same experiences they are handling this as much as you are as if more because they pulled the trigger
i have not been able to land a job that can also be semi safe my wife is a type 1 diabetic with 3 organ transplants and some other issues
i fucking hate them i have never felt so much rage at someone as i do with them no photography no image editing
what do i do shall i just die i do not want to live because i can not do anything and i feel so alone
his face turned red and the situation went really awkward i did not say anything about not getting invited just commented that it sounds very fun night
so i have been feeling pretty down for a while now and people on reddit have helped me and i am genuinely greatful so um here is a song i have got an entire playlist i would not mind sharing it if anyone needed it i like and maybe something that may give you some hope
and the way we build up our confidence after a break up the way you build your confidence and the way your break up does not have to break you is are the three es
we did not go all the way but planned on it and even talked about it a few times and we had already gotten very intimate before
i just keep waiting and praying to any god that will listen for him to want me back the truth of the matter is that i am fucking scared
i was sober when she said this and i felt so put on the spot i tried to just get her to go to bed because i did not want the first time we said i love you to be so messy
small gifts to show that he was thinking of me for no reason but i do not miss any specific ex this much at all
she has been to so many mental health hospitals and she says she is traumatized by them she said she has been injected with something to make her sleep as a punishment
he is also very closed minded and avoids his own problems by helping everyone else with theirs and will go totally out of his way to do so
she cussed me out and told me i was a piece of dog st i used this breakup to get an excuse to not have to visit family that weekend
i heard that you have been hurting lately you have been feeling that the world around you is crumbling like everything has been going to shit and there is no way out i see you babygirl and i am here to tell you it gets so much better
also my therapist is on recess for the next 3 weeks so i really need some help here how the hell do i move on does anyone else who got dumped after a long relationship has any advice about getting over and falling out of love
they compare me to my other friends on top high schools and better kids in my yearpeople keep leaving i have lost numerous ppl in the last few months
we broke up a few times this last month but it never really stuck we kept coming back together and trying and trying to make it work
addiction exacts an almost incalculably high financial and human toll on us here in the united states as the total economic cost to society is greater than all types of diabetes and all cancers combined
two weeks ago i messaged all of them roughly nine or so people and said that i was having a really hard time and that i would love to talk to them all just to chat together and catch up i set up a zoom and sent them the details no response
i am constantly stuck in detrimental thought loops for days at a time and i am not sure what i can do as it is getting worse
i fucking hate the house that i live in it is so fucking dirty and cockroaches everywhere i have been crying for no reason at all like tears just came out of nowhere
428httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat268s what about the leftover days when people are no longer around 549httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat349s how does this change with covid lockdown
without them as toxic and fucked up as it is in the house i do not have anyone else in this world but myself
with somebody who does not exist i know i should not go back that he may have changed but the problems will still be there
and i had 0 friends for almost 3 years because i just could not keep up with the world when the time came for me to choose a career i wanted to study architecture
in the past he broke up with me for saying i love you first has been mad at me for not telling my parents about him or telling them that he said hi etc
this year has been increasingly difficult with covid 19 but at a small christmas get together this morning i had a manic episode in the middle of opening presents i have an amazing family and wish i could avoid the littlest things causing me to spiral now after everything i am left feeling like a total piece of shit for ruining a holiday and now thinking they are just better off with out me
i do not even know what it is like to be truly loved that feeling of love is something i have never been able to experience because i have been trapped in my house for the past 45 years and i am only 16
and it really hurt me that she did not love me enough to not leave me that day she lost her husband before coming to our house the first time
i really do not know why everyone lately making fun of me my thoughtsmy ideas and everything about me like they just want have the chance to make fun of me and it really hurt
i will make sure that everything is taken care of before i leave this world i do not want to leave her or my family in a tough spot
my mother has always been an alcoholic and possessed anger management issues ever since i can remember the places i have been to these people have nothing they have real problems
i feel the knife continually being stabbed into me unearthing new and painful memories for me to analyze and cry over as it tears into my skin
and if she does i can not promise that i will not do something to myself i have struggled with mental illness my whole life lost everyone close to me
i hope evreryone is okay please take care and be careful 3 if you need to talk feel free to dm me
i did this for 3 weeks when she came back to me crying talking about how she missed me and felt too anxious to be without me
and sometimes i ask myself is my brain wired differently are drugs used by parents while pregnant a contributing factor to mental health issues as an individual ages
my emotions constantly flip between depression and rage every few minutes i have lost almost all control over my thoughts and feelings
i gave such a huge piece of myself to you and i wish i knew that you stopped loving me the way i love you
after i saw my doctor yet to see a neurologist she said just to stay calm and stuff so i have been trying
i just feel like if i was not here she could go to her fathers and be ok and the stress of everything would be gone
i am trying to do this in a way that causes the list amount of pain and disruption i know some people will feel sad but i am not responsible for managing everyone is feelings
thank you jesus thank you for deleted my cheated ex gf out of my life i am hurting right now but i will have a happy future with a girl who really love me and respect me i trust in you
also i do not even have the motivation to study as well although i kind of wish to even when exams are approaching i still do not feel motivated
i asked him what he was drinking over there trying to be calm and to not immediately become accusatory but i was fairly certain
my mother even said to my face if you do not like it here then leave and i tried once and she said never do that again like what the fuck am i supposed to do
some of us are here because they are lonely or feel lonely we know that it is not always easy to find the right people to get along with
so why do i have absolutely zero energy zero motivation no interest in anything feel overwhelmingly sad at all times no interest in food or sex or anything good why do i just want each day to hurry up and end so i can go back to bed what the fuck is wrong with me
grief is not a straight line you do not go from let us say the anger to the bargaining stage and never revert to any of the previous ones in reality you would shift between the two for days or weeks before you would settle in one
i do not want to get my hopes up we have been nc for about two weeks i am hoping he will wish me a merry xmas i get anxiety when i think about it
my ex has already given all of those things to someone else except her body i really hope she has some sense to recognize that i am not a lying conniving person
what made me fall hard and fast was how he was how he was nothing like my ex partner he was considerate made me feel like the prettiest girl in the world would do anything to make me happy even if it made him look less manly or his friends would make fun of him he just genuinely loved seeing me happy
now i am not worried i will be dead tomorrow or even by new years but i feel myself planning and preparing more
in all of this he stopped supporting me at all was emotionally neglectful and put 0 into the relationship after month 2 leaving me worrying more about it than myself and my mental health also when he broke up with me he used my deteriorating mental health as one of the reasons
when he sleeps he looks like a child and i can stare at him for hours holding him like a baby
and on the outside i look like i am doing completely fine but in the inside i am a mess for hours that i am fine feel like invalidates my depression
not that i have some small part of me that wants to keep going just a small part of me that thinks that something will be on the other side that could be worse while the rest of me is clocked out and ready to go
nowadays i have sudden episodes of having visions and thoughts in my head of killing my schoolmates teachers and myself afterwards
i have no idea what this could mean for me and was wondering whether there are many people with a similar issue i know that most disorders have overlap with others but it still kind of freaks me out
my folks also invited me to drive 3 hours to see them but i am really not sure i would make the drive through the mountains without pulling the steering wheel
i have 2 kids with this woman and i fought ferociously through the courts to win my 2 children full custody
for a couple of days i fixate on one specific memory that bothers me and i ended up breaking down because of how emotional and hopeless i became from reliving those moments
i just can not let it keep killing me from the inside outso of course she has less time and is caring more about her boyfriend now
i can not control how i feel most of the time and that is if i am even feeling real emotions everything feels so robotic to me like the real me is not even there i am anxious all the time and it sometimes gets so bad that i start physically shaking this is all stuff you have probably seen beforebut it gets much worse
i do not know how else to describe it other than i just did not care i could not cry i could not feel anything
hello everyone i recently remembered that i had a lots of difficulty to socilaze 2 years ago i hope you find someone you can love unconditionally even if it is not me
update 1 13 hours later he messaged me on a different application and asked that i forward the letter on messenger i did i am sure he already knows where the point of my letter is heading at anyway my messages got delivered but he has not seen it and been offline for 41 minutes already
he lied and used me for a whole year and it mentally fucked me up maybe it sounds a bit extra but i really feel traumatised
i feel as though i failed as a human i feel broken i feel like something from within me is missing i have since picked up cello to help cope and as strange as it is it does help i must be crazy or something because how can i get upset over something or someone rather that does not exist
despite everything i still want to be with you until the end of the year i was lost and this my scream at the void
sometimes things play over in my head like a loop tape good and bad i makecreatemanifest my life into a movie scenemusic video
he says its nothing i have done and there is absolutely nothing bad that has even happened but he just wants to stay single and live life alone
i am seriously considering just ending it tonight run a warm bath down all my meds at once and just drift into the abyss
i am losing the only thing keeping me alive she already told me a couple weeks ago that she started liking another guy then said she do not like him no more then she says she loves me more than anything now whenever i try to talk to her one minute it will be fine then she starts typing one word answers and she then says everything is fine then she says she is tired and goes to sleep i am losing her and when i do i have already decided i am going to do it i just do not know how
they could not find any illegal assets but now everything we have ever owned is seized some are inherited and there is no way to prove the source of income for that
i do not want advice on how it is important to keep these bonds i want to prepare myself for life where no others can influence my feelings ever again
you were happy you were shining again i saw that în your smile in your voice in your eyes your soul was healed and happy
between my ex parents and the mental health system i was pretty sure i was unlovable probably inadequate in every way
everyday is a struggle for me and i do not see myself getting over this i have panic attacks and breakdowns almost daily i have been going to therapy since we initially ended things
the irony of all this is that she had invited me to her birthday get together with a few of our mutual friends that is happening this saturday night and upon finding out that she is on tinder i feel like i should not go anymore and just drop off the gifts that i got her already with a note of how i am feeling and why i did not want to go to the get together
i picked her up she told me that many things did not come as natural as before that she felt trapped that i was lazy and other things
i have always moved around in my life scotland to australia australia to scotland scotland to germany germany to england england to scotland
sticking to the law and living a somehow mentally healthy life is almost impossible every night i lay in my bed alone most days i would not even care
i felt it the transformation of our daily interactions from warm to cold intimacy dissipated highlighting our present incompatibility i felt that this was her true self
it can either destroy you or fix you i thought about giving up i have got so much to live for but at that point it felt like i had lost it all
i am a little confused on something i was happy for him like genuinely happy i miss him but in my dream it looked like everything he wanted
but then get up and do more of the stuff that makes you feel good or will make you feel good in the future
i do not know what she read and did not read but in that moment i also said fucked up shit and ruined my last chance at her ever wanting to talk it out
we had lots of fun together but he claimed he did not love me i was really bitter about this we spent every day of covid together and summer and in general were just best friends
i acted harshly when i knew i should not and took my partner for granted even though i should have put more effort into our relationship
i deserve to live a horrible life where i am ugly sickly poor and starving my death would be a christmas miracle
your emotional advisers will advocate for you to take the floor and you will be the president of the council in your head
after a couple of months she came out and told me that she cheated like 2 weeks after we started datingwe talked about it and i forgave her
imagine there is a perfume with fragrance so sweet that it intoxicates a person with surge of happiness we also know that perfume do not last nor their fragrance in order to make it last you must know the correct kind of flowers it was made from you must know how to cultivate those flowers and you must know how to turn those flowers into a perfume you must know the art of permanent happiness
also her birthday was coming up i did not know how to tell her i was not going i though about making up an excuse at the last moment
i do have friends and i hate the fact that i do i just want to be a quiet person that does not want or need friends and just be mysterious and no one to know anything about me i have not had any fake friends or bad experiences with friends is it normal to be like this
i feel like at this point if i am 24 yo and do not have a single friend there is obviously something wrong with me people often meet me and are surprised when they realize i do not have friends
and trust me i wish i could do it different we became friends during the relationship and we are still on really good terms
human life naturally moves toward entropy we will be dealing with loss and chaos as long as we live and this goes far beyond just our romantic relationships we are going to lose our jobs kids health our mom and dad and we are going to have to deal with all of it in the end we are even going to start losing ourselves
i look terrible since the hair salons are all closed due to covid 19 i must order everything i need to do my own hair then get decent clothing so i can make a presentable selfie pic
i will never have anyone to talk to i will never have a person to hold me i will never have anyone no friends no boyfriends nobody
part of me is saying to self harm for a release at 21 i found someone again who really does love me we have been together for 2 years
i can not just turn off my tears with the snap of a finger my mom knows i have depression but i do not think she fully understands how it works
i just can not fight anymore i can not have this negativity in my life i felt betrayed i felt lost where did i go wrong was the first question in my mind
when i asked him directly what is this he said that i am crazy that i betrayed him and looked at his private information and i had no right to do so well it was his business calendar that he shared with me
i do not feel like myself anymore i need real help and suggestions i do not want to be like thismy mental health has been in decline for the past several months
i post this and i am going to feel like an attention who are i am going to see comments telling me how to fix my life and ill get angry
all they do it repeat the same textbook advice without ever considering how shallow it may all sound feels like they are trying to get over with it quickly
i seemed to have a harder time moving on after a loved animal died and my family did not care much none of them cried other than me i am still mourning a few months later is caring too much my problem
the first time they got drunk and did cocaine the second time it was ecstacy she was upfront and told me about both times straight away and swore nothing happened
how do you get over a break up when for almost 14 of your entire life we have been together and he is all you have ever known
she knew about my issues and did not blame me for emotionally withdrawing but the daytoday was just too hard for her
i hope you all can somehow find peace one day i hope i can too my last birthday was the shittiest day ever but even more shitty than the ones before
i thought this was werid but thought that it was ok after 5 days back to back together i tried to talk about it to solve it

yesterday i wrote a letter and sent it to my ex telling how much realizations i have had over the past months we broke up and asked if he could give me another chance i also said if there can not be anymore i would accept it and i cannot keep him in my contacts anymore
the best way is to surround yourself with people who love and care about you even if you do not think so it is not true there will always be at least one person to help you
i have always never had much patience when it comes to my kids i am usually the mean strict parent but my wife was helping me change that as well
she introduced me to her cousins and colleauges that we are official she introduced me to her parents as her friend tho
even if i talk with my cousins they will most likely not be interested and just ignore my messages all the time
he started treating me badly calling me names blaming me for stuff i was not at fault it did not matter to me
true love is not when your partner solves your problems for youbut when they let you solve your problems by your self and support you all the way through
how do you move forward from your ideal partner i have already developed a list of things i do not like about them none of them are really anything of substance
the worst part is that i was the most privileged many of my mates who are socializing and living a happy life do not have it well some had lost loved ones but we are still okay
most people say dumpers only reach out once their new relationship fails in anyones experience is this true if anyone has experienced something similar to this what happened and can you give me adviceshow solidarity with me
i am having such dark thoughts and hating myself for failing but i can not stop it everythings piling up i do not know if i even can do it

i do not want to leave her or my family in a tough spot i know i need help but i literally do not want it
later life then played a cruel game of ultimatums my then nursing career or him since we found that we are different stages of life i chose the former and then i lost both i compromised patient safety twice in that it shattered any semblance of selftrust and confidence in myself
i know there could be a future for us when she starts to feel better and able to date again but i just do not want to be alone anymore
that night really hurt because i had to say goodbye to a person i really cared about so many thoughts and emotions overwhelmed me
in terms of music i stop listening to them because the songs i like are the emotional ones and it just makes me feel like crying everytime i hear them
i have been reading a lot about addicts to trying and understand if what was the happiest time in my life was even real
i miss you i wish you would have taken the time to talk to mewhatever it is from dealing with bad people i can not

my dad always says some sly comment about how i am inside all day and do not do anything my mother is constantly fighting and unhinged my sister distanced me from my friends i thought dropping out could give me time to think and go a different route but all i see is suicide at the end i just want to be content
i start looking around and noticing that people are acting suspicious like pacing or looking around i know it is in my head but i worry about it still
everyone around me seems to have other people in their life who they are busy with and it is not like i do not put myself out there i am actually quite extroverted
i gave her back the plushie she got me for valentines because i could not look in it is eyes anymore and i did not want to throw it

one of them from anime no game no life and i have one of my old friend hope can call she like that that being depressive with really angry parents suicidal thoughts and so on
but i was stupid i thought he was lying to me and i could not really bring myself to cut contact either so i kept asking him stuff and trying to talk to him and he was super rude with me sometimes too
i do not know what to do i do not know how to solve this problem i do not know what is wrong with me i do not know what i am doing wrong i just do not and it is eating me alive
and it would have been shitty to kill myself on christmas anyway my world was ruined i cried and cried every night

but now i am scared she will contact my mum again and i can not take back the aahow to hack into gmailduring lockdown i emailed a singer
he went out more often with his friends things become more awkward i feel like walking through an egg she will i felt like my presence alone was making him uncomfortable and then i myself got stressed out because i sensed he is uncomfortable in his own house i felt really bad so i said i will stay with my friend next week
so i came here and vented because i realised that i have no one to go to and do not know what to do when i have had a night like this and need help
my family is beginning to hate me they see me as the bipolar depressed loser at 25 who amounts to nothing

in a house she hates and never liked that she can not get up the stairs in he does not care about me he does not love me like he used to and it is hard
please help me i feel like my world is in black and white there will only be color after death i must rest
we routinely spend time together and she is shown interest in getting into shape more so when i go for runs i usually ask if she wants to come although she only rarely does
it is really sad because i used to have so many friends to talk to this time last year i met so many new people who were there for me and now they just act like they do not know me
about how old my mom looks and how better her life could be if she did not have me about how everything might just be a simulation playing out in my dying mind
she says she has grown from what she did and she has always wanted to have this moment where there could be an us again or atleast to a point where we began talking on a regular basis
i am at peace with my decision all my life i have done things for other people i have worked in behavioral health for years helping others anytime a friend needed me i was there in a heartbeat i even ended up as the emotional support ex for many of my ex partners i guess that is what is expected of you when you are a counselor lol
hearing that it will be okay just makes everything worse because i know it probably will be but it does not feel like it
is there a pill or something i can take that will stop the feeling of loneliness i have or do i need to surround myself with people somehow
i wish i would not continue to ask this man for validation he does not deserve me we have a dog together so that is one of the reasons i do not want to let go
i am happy for her she deserves to be happy it is not like i can fulfill her all physical and emotional needs being 4000 miles apart she needs someone
i just wish you cared enough to have helped me back because true love is being there for the people you love when they need you the most
this will be my final message to you from this point forward and i know you did not want me to do this but i felt the need to let you know even if you did not want to know
these images only last for a sec and i feel sick after them because i would never want to hurt anyone
i am currently bettering myself since the beginning of this year i have lost 65lbs finally approved for a loan to pay off my credit card and finally deciding to leave my crummy 8 year job that was not getting my anywhere plus i want to go back to school by next year
when i wake up in the morning my environment is almost always unfamiliar to me even though nothing much has changed in my environment for many many years
transitioning from the hospital to home was hard sometimes i missed the hospital life with my air casts on my feet people looked at me funny they always asked what happened and it would break my heart every time i lied about falling down the stairs
i am losing it everything i do reminds me of her and i cry myself to sleep most nightsi really do not know how to explain this properly
my life is not going anywhere i am not going to find love i am not going to be able to finish school and i have no money and everyday i just wish to die
why why have i always been alone maybe there is just something really wrong with me i have always been alone i realize sadly and i am alone even now and probably until the future
just want to ask though is there something wrong with me for feeling like this one was a total waste after doing a lot of retrospective work why i am also not dating or rebounding i realized that he was making me so unhappy even while we were together and my life has begun resonating on such a higher frequency without him in it
cuz otherwise there is nothing to be happy about maybe i am overreacting maybe i am just craving for attention but the reason i crave attention is cuz no one gives me that
i get that at times it gets hard and lonesome been there and still there tbhi just wanted to ask if introversion prevents you from building a social circle
i have never been able to break up with someone that i am still in love with but this relationship makes me so sad and lonely it is like a fire without any heat
finaly we come to the last part we were in some sporadic communication during last few weeks all initiated by me sometimes even friendly
i wish i could just disappear or maybe return to like i was before august having a stone face shield to block in and out emotions which partially made me invincible
i just needed to get this off my chest sitting alone in the uni library distracted by the void inside me craving for some physical affection and just feeling miserable after a breakup
i go weeks where i do not feel lonely then out of nowhere it hits me and i start to feel lonely and depressed i hate it like right now i just feel so lonely and depressed
i would love to have girl friends to talk to support each other go out to eat gossip make each others lives feel easier and more fulfilled
about 2 months ago she woke me up in the morning to dump me saying it was not working i have been devastated ever since but slowly healing
always want more money from me i loved him so much and got so little in returnto all this christmas you are not alone you are loved and amazing stay strong
the last few days i have suddenly felt tremendous amounts of sadness revolving around my exi am sure this is really pathetic i just wanted to say it somewhere
i do not deserve anything good and i just feel lost and disappointed in myself i feel like a burden and a waste space
make sure you get up and do something today anything that would drive the day by until one dayyou will actually move on
has anyone ever consented to sex or sexual activity while under the influence of mental illnessdisorderunwellnessetc and regretted the decision after getting well
i decided to still text my ex for the first and last time after our break up while all my friends told me it was a bad idea i sent him a goodbye text telling him some things i wanted to say which he did not really let me say because he blocked me right after breaking up long story short i got left on read
my loneliness is growing stronger and punishing me more day by day i have made too much of an effort to shut it out
i keep seeing lgbt people on social media or whatever live their best lives not my boyfriend not my friends not strange men and certainly not myself
i feel empty i feel like my true self has said fuck you and went out for a long walk throug the door and never came back i fear that with time i will fall into a bottomless pit of dark thoughts and the outcomes of those thoughts are very dark i hope this all shall pass
i asked him to tell her once again to leave him alone since she does not seem to get the message after being told exactly what was expected of her
1 you give more to life than you get you put in countless hours of effort to succeed for a short duration why would i want to be a small cog in the system there is not enough food money and travel to make me stay
i want to work on my conflict resolution skills but i do not want to just find a random book what are some titles that you have read or listened to that you really loved thanks
it is got a lot to do with the boy i am talking to though he is very nice to me and its nothing about him necessarily
i know this is only a temporary feeling but i am hoping it can stay just a bit longer this time
my life is a fucking sham it has always been however i used to at least feel a little bit of joy on christmas but now all it makes me want to do is start my car and drive into traffic this one is particularly horrible all of my realizations have come true
i also do not believe in the phrase i ll improve myself so much that they ll regret breaking up with me trust me on this i have tried it it just shatters your self confidence and you ll be at the lowest of lowwork on yourself coz you want to feel better about you
we started off a month before she left and i hoped that i would work out especially that we both were doing very well together
i recently got dumped by this girl that i love and adore but we are on somewhat speaking terms in the form of a chat log where we update each other on our lives give the choice i would be with her and we would have a healthy relationship
which is a perfect example of my odd awareness as doctors have described it of what is going on with my mind while still being unaware in basically every other aspect of life
my bf cheated on me and gave me an std he genuinely fucked up but he is through and through still a genuine person who accepts me for my flaws and anger i did something petty and he was forced to deal with the consequences
what infuriates me the most is that afterwards that stupid little shit says sorry i do not mean it just ignore me when i am angrylike shut the fuck up you stupid shit you have literally ruined my life
in elementary school i did not had friendsif it helps my medication 4mg risperidone 250mg venlafaxine i do not feel these are helping

i want to slit my wrists and thighs and feel the life drain out of me until i can not feel anymore
larry flint where larry gives a presentation and a speech about the governments attack on his freedom of speech and in the end of the scene he asks the audience what is more offensive sex or war
at the moment i am isolating and distancing myself from everyone more and more my whole life i always had to be the person to start the talking asking to hang out etc
if there is anyone who has gone through the same situation that i am going through please do contact me it is been 2 years since i have been in a relationship and i am deeply in love with her
so here i am now i feel hopeless towards my future i stopped exercising and on top of all that i regularly cry myself to sleep because i can not stand this wretched loneliness anymore even though i almost never cried before in my life
i had a similar problem with one of my online friends but to a lesser extent months later i have learned how to ignore you or not think about you as much at least
i am truly genuinely tired of this i do not know if i can do this anymore i am so tired of everything i just want to sleep permanently i really do not want to be here anymore
i have chosen to go into the sea i know it will be painful but not for long i found this extract from quora which enforces this decision to get into the sea
idk i am most definitely idealizing the idea way too much but it is a nice thought even though i would be a shitty traditional wife can not cook not attractive scared of pregnancy
i have struggled with both before but i have always been raised to believe that they are just things that come with being young
i feel like i am going to vomit it hurts so bad so i run back and swim to the bottom and hide again
i cry every single day because i do not know what to do with myself and not being with my parents for christmas is absolutely tearing me apart
is there anyone out there who is single and has few friends that feel the same way or just feel lonely in general am i the only one feeling like this
i have got one person who talks to me so i do not have a breakdown but i do not want to ruin their christmas with my negativity
or cut your hair as you do not have hair down to your fucking hipslike why can not i be viewed as one of you all
i apologized at the time because i regretted what i said afterwards but after not talking for a while i learned that it made me feel really better and although harsh it needed to be said
i also had a best friend of more than ten years but it was a really toxic relationship as she was always belittling and insulting me so i cut all ties a year ago
it is pretty much all i have known since i was about 1213 25 now after my dog dies i will more than likely kill myself with a 12ga to the face
i tried doing so many things to make friends but it is harder with the virus and also because it is just hard after an age to make friends with people
for some reason mental illness made itself known addiction issues and bpd were enough to tempt going outside of my marriage for a bj
i could never believe in imaginary friends i tried to have some but i could not i thought myself though as other things than human like a creature or an angel an ethereal something a cat a superhero from space that changes forms i used to play pretend a lot only by myself though my brother either was never with me or did not wanted to play with me i do not remember playing together
i am on the fucking internet talking to strangers because i feel more comforted here than in real life than in my own house
my life experiences during this time were mostly trying to keep a roof over my head losing faith in everything and stagnating in every meaningful way
than in my own house but i lost that and even if he broke up with me and lost me bc of it
i do not have any friends right now so i i have nobody to text nobody to talk to and nobody to spend time with
pretty sure the other girl is convinced it is something it is not unless my ex is telling her that and i am just not sure of the details
i wonder every day since i was 16 about what it is like to have supportive parents and a healthy relationship with them
every now and then i would feel as though someone is standing close to me i can almost hear her laugh or call for me i am almost convinced i have been shown a parallel life goodness i can not be around childrens clothes without being ready to cry
i struggle with pretty bad anxiety from being bullied most of my life so far but sometimes i have these horrible thoughts and i get scared i have not acted on them so far but i am kind of afraid that i might one day send me a pm if you want to know more not really comfortable sharing it publicly
i think she must be hurt because even when i told her i broke up with my recent ex the fact that she saw us walking made her do all those kind of things i mentioned above so i feel guilty and everything is my fault honestly i do not want to go back to her but the fact that she got a new boyfriend in less than a month triggers me a bit
but i moved out of the room a few days ago and she seems to get upset if i hang out with her for more than 1020 minutes now and asks me to leave
but not even my best friend wants to answer my texts is this like a stage of breakup and has anyone else experienced similar things
it is normal for me to keep my demons to myself i do not like talking to people i know about my personal problems or issues mainly due to the fact i am scared they might look at me differently and i am scared they might think i am just doing this for attention when i am clearly not
i am in my mid 20s and i have my family that cares about me but i still can not help feeling that i will die in a hospital bed surrounded by strangers i have no friends have never been in a relationship and i feel so alone it hurts so bad i do not know how to form connections with anyone what do i do
i have been seeing her for over a year now but i feel like she is not helping me she talks about the same stuff and takes the same approach to every issue and i do not feel like it is helping me i feel guilty because it is the pandemic and i know money is short for everyone how do i tell her i do not want to see her anymore without hurting her feelings
and people who are for the world wonder why lifes so hard or why our emotions and mental health problems are so bad
i do not have friends because when everyone having fun in their teenage years and twenties i work my ass off just trying to survive because i do not have family anymore
the best i got was 23 sessions with a therapist before i decided it was not a good fit fast forward to june 2020
however whenever one of my friends or someone i know tries to screw with me when i know not to take it seriously i am still sensitive to it
on the second try he called me and made me induce a gag reflex to some extent he helped me or so it seemed to me
last year i tried to kill myself usually it is hard but i keep going i am not sure how long i will be able to hold myself together anymore
here is the issue there are times where i forget entirely who i am and i have no memory of these episodes
well the day i moved out the same day i woke up with a bad face i went to go say good morning to her and her bf and she stated saying she did not like the look of my face and she can feel my attitude well that same night we night we had a fight and as i was doing my laundry she took my clothes while it was still washing and put hers in
honestly i have no idea where to start so i will just go right to the part where i tried last friday i tried robbing myself of my life
especially when we would had several conversations and only yesterday he told me he loved me and that he was not going to break up with me because he loved me and we were going to work things out
you deserve to be someone is priority to be understood and to find a community who can be your safety net and you theirs
the way he looked at me was eye catching like he had never looked at anyone like he had looked at me
but i got annoying and she got mad and she blocked me on everything i wad devastated againand then i fell for a guy last year in my college
now i am 81 and to be honest it does not feel better at all you see after the break up i was all caught in that become the best version of yourself thing
i know i might be living on false hope but its keeping me alive what am i supposed to do please do not say anything like get over her
i think i stopped being sad a long time ago too close to when she passed away even if no one reads this at least i tried
he always called me by my name where i called him bunny i have always been lonely but never literally this alone
i want to be a translator but freelance life is tough i do not know how to find clients advertise myself operate a business pay my taxes
well he begged me not to that he will work on his feelings that he is not sure he was crying and saying that he does not want to be with anyone but me
i am just looking for some type of explanation on why i do act like this and how can i change this i really do not want to lose my girlfriend
tldr is it normal to need social interactions to feel joy even if i have an otherwise balanced life of hobbies exercise and therapy
when we met we were both lost confused and without a solid path i felt like i found my path and that i was changing as a person because of it
i am in a much better place now i know break ups happen for the best everyday i get a little further though i am still on the mend i believe it is best to endure the pain exist and thrive in spite of it and i get that it is not about me
but i feel like i am getting worsehim acting like an ass towards the end really helped move on from the breakup
i do not care anymore about college family and pretty much everything else nothing feels like it matters anymore cut to the next day and she is upset i actually friended him and tells me she is not happy
i know she will be devastated to lose me but at least she will know that it is over that i am no longer pain
i am normally a rather driven and somewhat extroverted person but these dreams which have occurred at least 8 times in the past few months just sap away my energy
for the story i am working on i am looking to talk with others who have experienced loneliness in similar ways if you are interested in chatting with me please reach out by private message i would love to hear from you and well i suppose it goes without saying here but if you have felt this kind of emotional painyou are not alone
so i went i said i thought we needed to talk because things had not been great and it had been making me question everything
on this day we celebrate life rebirth it is very different this year with the pandemic and families being forced to be away from their loved ones from the holiday it shows us that we can still be connected we can still celebrate and be grateful for life and what we have been given we must solely look within
you want to be succesful in this or that try harder do not give up nope if you are on this mental health situation life will be harsh punishing because of your own health regardless of your talents or qualities
i tried convincing her that i am different from the other girls sheve met that just leaves her once she feels attached
not surprisingly having a steady stream of healthy selfesteem also benefits your future romantic relationships i do not want to be here i just wish i could not wake up one day
it is no ones fault really i have a sensitive temperament that makes me a bit out of sync a little hard for others to understand i know that i can not change who i am nor can i change other people but this does not make the pain go away
he lost his job due to covid and i was still working ft he moved home different province and started working for his brother
is that all there is out there now sending hey we should meet up and then never meeting up for years on end it is so depressing
dependent personality disorderhttpswwwwebmdcomanxietypanicguidedependentpersonalitydisorder in which people rely excessively on others for advice or to make decisions for them borderline personality disorder in which people have difficulties in many areas including social relationships behavior mood and selfimage
too top it all off when my bf asked why i was sent home i lied again i told him they took my temperature and it came out high
i have not seen her or spoken to her in a year i do not want sympathy more so just adviceso i left
our honeymoon period was absolutely amazing and i continue to look back on this period and feel an incredible amount of pain and heartache wondering where everything went wrong
looking back i reckon that i should have communicated better and tried to facilitate more conversation instead of just holding out
she already says to me that it was hard to continue how we were doing but every times i tried to make thing better
this is our last year studying so i straight away asked him are you going to be with me next year
i have been around lately and for most actions and tasks i will ask myself what my ideal spouse would be doing it helps me form good habits
i go through the same 4 apps closing opening closing opening he was so madly in love with me i just do not understand i am so so so sad
over all the whole notion of belonging to a heads or tails game of living out a life filled with expectation of fulfilling a goal to accomplish in ones afterlife should never be a childs priority growing up in this modern day and age where science and history and facts over excede the notions of anything a religious background can represent
any word that you use often look at the definition of it read the definition of it because when you read the definition of it you might figure out your understanding of it is untrue and therefore you are using a heavier word
but i am not grateful and i admit it i still have no motivation no happiness from doing anything that i loved just a year ago
but i just feel so alone because my very toxic and dysfunctional family decided to put 0 effort and to act as they always act screaming at each other eating what we always eat not saying a word during dinner which ended in like 10 minutes
i really wish the best for you in life on your pursuit to happiness and i hope one day you will be able to achieve that happiness you deserve i just wanted to send this letter to thank you for helping me find my peace i have always looked for in myself you were my first love and i will never forget that about you
i have been alone for like half a year in 2019 and when i just jumped into seeing everyone in my new place of living like 7 people all at once i had a mental breakdown on the spot right after i was again left alone
i am okay with that what i am not okay with is that a couple weeks leading up to it he had been really distant
today is the birthday of my exgirlfriends brother who has passed he passed when i was with her and it just hurts me to not be with the family and support them while they celebrate him today just because our breakup is almost at a month now just feels weird how its not my life anymore
was released with a pta went back to my home with a police escort to grab my stuff did not found the luggages so everything went into trash bags grab my dog she kept the car and apartment and i was there just homeless for long couple hours my dog and 3 trash bags but the most happy man alive for the first time i was feeling free
so yesterday he broke my computer and most of my things including a photo of my mother anyway this morning i packed my things and left
however i still want to get her back and she made it abundantly clear that she wanted to get back together too and that she was going to take the next 30 days to really get her life in order and so was i
it is made me a terrible person and such a mean and dark soul but behind that i am such a soft guy but after not having love and just someone to lean back onto the feeling of love becomes completely alien to you
i do not know what it is like to genuinely spend time with people i have never met a real person who is interested in anything i truly have to say
i told myself i would not make it to 16 then 18 then 20 then 21 i am going to turn 22 in february which is mindblowing to me because i first attempted suicide in 2014 when i was 15 this year alone i have had 5 attempts so in my lifetime i have easily attempted near 20 times
i could finally do things and people would not always bring up race and skin color towards me and so i texted him i said i saw a shooting star and it was beautiful
i do everything on my own about my life all plans i do not share anything i think about because i believe nobody will understand and they will just say my plans are ridiculous also i am closeted gay to some extent and it is also like closing myself inside
i am so tired i do not want to have to work or put effort i know that is selfish and that is the point of why i want to die i do not want to do work i want to be lazy i do not want to put effort into things i am not going to be a good hardworking member of society that is why i am going to die january 2nd
in these past few years i have felt so upset with the fact i had to be born and had to exist
i messaged her on the thursday to ask for just a reason i could understand because everything seemed fine leading up to the drug argument
i have been getting very anxious about myself dying or my mum dying and end up on my ownsorry for it probably so just leave me fucking beif you want to piss me offthen suck my dickhead
i have written over half a dozen notes over the past year trying to explain why i did what i did i think i am a relatively good communicator i would leave resources for the people i left behind to start seeking help as well
i am have a crippling video game addiction i spend upwards of 16 hours a day on the internet a lot of this is video games but since my parents do not let me play videogames for 16 hours i watch twitch the rest of the time i am wondering if its possible to be addicted to twitch i am currently seeing a psychologist and he thinks that my addiction may be the because of my depression and depersonalization
but this morning i woke up and thought man i really just do not want her in my camera roll and just did it right then and there
whatever i also have my period which is not really helping any it loves to come at the worst timesi swear the universe has one sick sense of humor i can not help grinning at that though it is kind of funny how it shows up just when i do not need it to show up hah i am 49let us get this menopause train arollin shall we
i just want to talk to you so badly i just want to have one even if it is the last honest and open conversation
what is there to even enjoy anymore even if the pandemic ends i will still be a great big nothing to the world and to the people in it my job issued christmas cards to everyone except me i probably sound so self centered and i probably am i am not a very good person i know it
i think about relocating for work opportunities and being in a new city with no friends and wonder if i would just be in my apartment by myself constantly excited to go to work for social interaction
she has everything i could ever ask for in a girl she was always super outgoing caring and she was just overall so supportive of everything
i do what i can to refuse but she do not take a no as an answer so idk what to do
my husband is the best and most caring human being alive and he would make a great father i know he would love being one too
he is only 57 and got picked on a lot in school and other kids thought he was gay we met 3 years ago while he was going thru his 3rd divorce
just in case i look like a stalker i cut off the contact but i was quite harsh when i did it and did not think it through
my phone stays empty you keep following whores who show their body as a hobby and you let my daughter down just like her father and just like you swore you never would
what probably pushed me over the edge was a recent breakup it was my first relationship it ended a month ago though we were only together for just under a year
my dads gf or soontobe ex i do not know honestly has this weird thing where she accuses everyone around her of wanting to end themselves
today is the first time anyone has ever told me they miss me it is also the first time someone has told me i am funny
between the pandemic the distance and these challenges it is difficult to fight against it all i would love to sit in a coffee shop and talk to someone have game night with people
i hyper focused and started wonder why we never connected anymore i offered countless times to fix the issue and addressed it because it was important to me
3 i would still like to come over there we can see and should each other if we want to you want to etc however i do have a place to stay of my own
everybody left my hometown and i was left alone nobody ever kept in touch despite my efforts and after a while i stopped trying because it felt like i was an inconvenience
it is like in the moment my mind is a blur of horrible thoughts he did not do anything wrong besides reject me i just can not make sense of it
we do not develop courage by being happy every day we develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity happiness is an inside job do not assign anyone else that much more power over your life
he hates me never believing his lies and my snide remarks about his shit and hates when i call him out he yells at me loud so i will stop
i felt so disrespected and so torn i could not believe he would do this to me he keeps telling me that he loves me that he was sorry and he would not do it if we were together he did it when we were apart
after breaking up i got off the lease severed any financial ties moved back home for the time being i have until april at the earliest until i have to make any permanent decisions regarding my career where i am going what i am doing
i was the only child at home and my mother has kids from a previous marriage who i was afraid to inform because they would only look out for her and i felt would essentially just put him in some hospital or jail
needless to say very little has changed and much is coming to pass how i thought it would despite my best efforts whatever purpose my life has burns dimmer and dimmer
i actually have no one at all i do know lots of people but none of them are close to me
everything was going great until month 9 into our relationship i started to see certain behaviors that were quite manipulative basically what some would call red flags but we still loved each other and had a great relationship
i feel like after j die there will be a demon or entity of some kind that will tell me that my whole life was just a trick and i can not stop thinking about it
i knew staying in contact while simultaneously trying to get on with our lives would probably because pain on both sides
not supportive of my mental health you will always be suic1dal gets mad if i do not text him when i am in class or sleeping
i do not hate her for anything i hate myself for reacting this waywe honestly do not even have that much in common
i honestly think we both just changed so much in the last four years and we do not want the same things anymore
you can dm me anytime you want and let us help out each other i hate myself why am i like this tired of being heartbroken and disappointed
he made me feel so comfortable and safe with him he even told his parents about me he never tells them about anything like that
she was upset for a couple days but we moved past it we continue talking all day every day slowly progressing from snapping and texting to facetimes
outside of work that is he has no choice there now i am at the lowest point i have ever reached and i just want everything to end
so here i am waiting hoping for the best but frankly at this point expecting the worst stuck in this loop holding up our family unable to do what i do best conquer the challenge because it is not mine to conquer waiting because it is all i can do
i am aware of meditation apps but i am looking more for mental health knowledge like from mental health self help books articles of videos that are packed into duolinguo like app so you can invest 5 minutes or more everyday and slowly build your mental health knowledge for self improvement
this is a post not aimed at me but this entire community maybe 5 years mean more than a few compromising situations i know it is the circumstances as well
my ex did not treat me too well did not come near me preferred to drink than spend time with me and made me feel paranoid if i asked questions of why she was not intimate with me i asked her if her feelings had changed and she said they had not until the may when she just broke up with me on our 3 year anniversary she even stopped me seeing her son and told me he did not want to see me which i struggled with as i did everything for him i have recently found out she has a new gf its plastered all over fb thr girl is the complete opposite to me too
i never asked to be here and yet there is this whole list of expectations i was supposed to meet and since i did not now i am less than since i stopped caring about such expectations i am the one to be sorry for
i would like to start by saying that i have had suicidal thoughts for as long as i can remember and have tried to kill myself in more than one occassion to this day i consider myself a failure for not having the courage to finally do it
so i called my doctor and was able to get my medication changed to a higher prescription a week later he broke up with me
i asked her what she meant and she reminded me that three months prior she had told me that she does not think that she should be in a relationship at the moment as her physicalmental health issues continued to pile up and she did not feel like she was giving me enough in the relationship which i quickly denied telling her that i was there for her no matter what
your ex is an ex for a reason and she is far from healthy you do not want people like that in your life
for me i do this in the tub i turn off all lights hot water super slow and calm music emotional piano instrumental by e minor that is the songs name you should hear it
they have been mentioning a hamster funeral they want to hold with readings i want to love and to feel loved please someone let me know how do i meet my soulmate
it made me really stressed out and my anxiety was off the charts lmao i was confused as to why he was not comforting me
the worst part is that the day after this happened i realized that a couple days ago i had saved a website on my phone called dontcallthepolice
in this world of billion people i only have me it is hard waking up everydayy only to be lonely and no one to share anything with
encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying there are always more and better choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or helping actively or passively them to end their lives
they just want a quick booty call without feelings and i am just not built that way before i do that i want to be in a loyal relationship with someone i trust and love
i am constantly going through the motions of life but it is hard sometimes to be okay i hate myself sometimes because i can not get things under control i feel like i no longer have a grip on my life i feel like i have ruined everything i turn eighteen in less than a month and i am so terrified and the highs and lows are killing me
me fucking depressed then makes a new account and writes a bunch of extremely suicidal texts to her fuck improving i am done with life pointless bullshit anyway before it happens you still want my cat
part of me always knew that being isolated and alone is bad and unhealthy because it is even scientifically proven that loneliness is even worse than smoking
everytime i listen to something with meaningful lyrics i just feel like shit only thing i managed to do is to get clean since i am broke basically was forced to do it
it took 100000 miles across a border to see each other over 4 years a different time zone a different race a different culture but we spoke the same language when it came to love every second was worth it to see her gorgeous face run up excitedly to open the door now all i am left with is these vivid memories of incredible adventures irreplaceable moments and deep love
just this year alone i have lost my home and several friends to suicides and overdoses i tried to start a small business a lifelong dream of mine and i lost that too i lost my career in march my wife left me six months ago and whatever goodness was left in my soul went with her all that is left is rotten and grotesque
but yesterday i was dissociating and i was getting waves of it really bad and feeling dizzy and eventually i passed out
so i stopped taking it about 3 days ago now and i am thinking i should get back on it but i am just scared and unsure
i called the break up on my almost1year relationship with my ex because he said he lost feelings for me after 6 months we stayed together for a while after until i could not handle it anymore after 8 months
i have had 2 recent relationships since then one with a guy named dawson and another named madison who both broke up with me after seeing me in person and never gave real explanations for why they did
i am unemployed and have a hard time getting a job because i have been arrested not convicted before hopefully i can get a break soon though because i am being kicked out of my parents house so i will be an unemployed homeless guy who is suicidal without his meds and is prone to addiction
what kind of fuck up can not even commit suicide properly every day since then has been a struggle a constant fight in my head to try and see past the pain and regret
in my opinion i treated him really really well and the girl he is with now who is freshly 18 might i add will not be able to provide for him in the ways that he is used to
i felt it especially when my two girlfriends left me he also cheated on my mom when i was very little and they stayed together for us
my hometown you were perfect for my college years but you slacked off during the distance it takes two buddy i could not do it by myself so i had to say goodbye i deserve better someone who will fight for me and choose to stay with me love your ex
i am in a much better mental state now so we had a talk over drinks about why i felt the way i did and tried to make it clear that that is not how i actually feel and that he should not take it to heart
anyways i proceeded to tell her that nothing happened and she needed to stop being dramatic since we were not dating so we did not break up
i have basically been obsessed with wanting to hurt her mentally andor physically i have been in such a bad place over this and have not been able to kick it
because of this i am soon to negotiate what is likely to look like a decent pay rise with a tonne of responsibility
because of that i broke my conditional release and now is a felony and the police went for me again trying to find me to take me back to custody and make sure i went to the court
i am sorry i do not mean to be a botheri do not know if maybe it is a way for me to defend myself or what
we both worked at restaurantsbars so we found ourselves both unemployed and spent a month apart staying at our respective parents houses
the thoughts never stop i keep thinking about a variety of ways of how to finally do it stop existing not that i ever came close to knowing what existence feels like
like i said things went really well for like 3 months after a while though i decided i wanted out it had been fun but it was time to move on so i broke up with her
i wish i could be dead i am depressed i am useless i am lost and i am sick of going on this way i am sick of the dismal patterns why was i born to live out all of this misery
she has a therapist herself and have suggested more than once i get one as well i do not know i feel like such a fool
i am going to grow up lazy and i will not be able to get a job that my parents would be happy with
he also told me much to my surprise do not hesitate to text me if you need anything alright which is very kind but it has my mind of course holding onto any shred of hope i can grasp thinking we will get back together eventually
i asked him why he could not say anything good about me and then he said well are not the bad things just as important then he said i was not confident enough that he is happier wo me and that he lost feelings for me
honestly i think if i do not i will just want to even more i did not want to cry in front of him
i will not get the future i have been building for the past 2 years by remaining his friend i will essentially have to watch someone else take that future away from me
she would always say she missed me and said how much she liked meeverything happens for a reason as cliche as it soundsyou are beautiful in your own way your own damn way
i want to my brain to get to normal levels so i can feel like ok again i am still sick i think because of the inflammation
so please give me some encouraging words or something that would make me feel better or get me to stop feeling so heavy and hopeless and intensely sad and lonely
so today is day 5 of no contact but scratch that because you texted me at 1230am to wish me a merry christmas
she would text me back hours apart and our conversations became dry this year with the covid pandemic has been worse for my mental health
i am worried about what they think or that they are laughing at me to the point that i do not even enjoy stuff i used to
i told her i was not going to force her to do anything if she wants to get back together in the future that is her decision
the other times they are just being friendly and once there is a moment of silence they are also gone it is not that i want to be alone or something but i just can not talk to people well
i had a good day and i was in a good mood but i just sit around all day and get in my head
i feel like a burden and a waste space and hurting my wifes heart and soul is the worst pain i have ever encountered
i just need some advice and i fear that i am overexaggerating my problems and being a child about all of this and should suck it up and date him because he treats me better than the last one did i do not know what to do
he became so angry with me so he broke up with me i was feeling really bad about because i knew what i did was wrong
i try to walk as an exercise now and then but it is not enough i love used to love i do not understand why i do not feel happy anymore whenever i bake cook snacks
people tell me it will get better or to stay strong and have hope but how can i it feels like i have been dealing with my health issues for too long
it feels like i am existing just for others i am not really living can not be gone because i am obligated to be here
i have never told anyone how close i have felt like i got to ending it because i am always scared of their reaction i know the only people it is fair to share this kind of thing with is doctors but i am always scared they will tell parents or take away my control or something
you have to be careful when you are going through a break up of the language you choose to describe how you feel and any word you keep using look at the definition and ask yourself is that really the emotion i am experiencing
i recently made a test for the asperger syndrome and apparently i have all the characteristic and that could explain a lot of thing about my life
also after some calibration the screen was fine and an 116 laptop does not need great viewing anglessomething is really wrong with me
i stopped checking both sides of the road when i am crossing because i secretly hope something hits me and ends my miserable existence
they were not able to trace the location i still do not know why so no one ended up going to my friends house and luckily my friend is fine now
i know i am not the only one and i am sure there is a number of people on here that struggle with this a lot more then me
i want to see i always say i want to die i am going to drive to a bridge on new years eve and i want to see what will happen i am going to go there and really weigh my pros and cons of life i want to know down to the bare fucking bones what weighs more and then lol hopefully i will jump and it will all be over who fucking knows
anyway now after i have been caught smoking the devils lettuce my parents are both chinese and marijuana is extremely stigmatized in asian countries your life could be ruined by just being in possession of it my parents have decided that my life is going downhill and are setting me up for failure
i can not remember the last time my lips locked with someone elses i can not remember the sensations of holding someone is hand
i had people like this before too pushed them all away have not seen talked to them in years i love them more than life itself i would never wish to hurt them at all
now i will be her friend because that is what she wants me to be apparently i have got no shoulder to cry on anymore
so what did i do i ordered drugs all the time which is not like me at all usually i like to work out and make music but all of that went out the window i felt so lonely hopeless anxious and depressed i was drinking every day doing cocaine and taking benzos
but just feeling terrible about my self every single day hour minutebut the way i deal with themand even the way i think of them have been changed forever
there is this girl i have been talking to for awhile and we have not started dating and i am not sure that will happen
is anything anyone fault we are born by luck the way we are raised is luckscenarios we are put in by luck and the decisions we make in life are based on these things maybe we do choose to do these things but what even is choice
i feel really bad now she did not seem sad but rather angry at me for being like every other man she met before and it is understandable but i still have feelings for her
i will try to keep this brief and concise but i would appreciate some support please comment if you can 1 i am not diagnosed yet but seeing a therapist
it may stab on the left it may stab on the right pain is predominantly right side under the shoulder blade
i am just going to keep applying to the same school i always have and hope that with that comes social life and responsibilities and i can remember why i wanted to go to that school in the first place and get that passion back
by this point i started therapy and on the advice of my therapist i explain to my ex that i am willing to work on things but if she does not want to be with me then we need a clean cut
i want her back for good and i want to start by making our meeting fun i am seeing her next week
but i can never say no and i can not ask for it i do not even know how to ask and how to stay i do not know what to say when i am asked what would i like to do how am i what do i like how was my day
i have been dealing with constant paranoia for the past 5 months it is all with online things and i freak out about stuff like malware and people stealing my accounts
then i just found out yesterday that he likes me as more than friends and i feel happy to hear that
i just feel so empty and wish i could go back in time when we lived together and rest my head on her chest once more she was my best friend and soulmate according to her ahha it is hard to let go
there is a lot more to all of that but he did move my furniture out for methey are not that bad after all they still ask about you
in some time you will not get the urge to cry when you hear that song your heart will not jump when you see their friends in public you will realize that you are not unloveable and you will not dream about them every night
i moved into my first house alone april 27th this year i would never lived alone prior to this and i do not think living alone is making me feel lonely i think the fact the majority of the people i want to be around are at least a 40 minute drive away makes me feel excluded from the people i love who are all so close together
obviously a different apartment but same building i really like the location and i do not think he visits him more than once a month
i have been looking into youth shelters lgbt shelters i am ftm trans and even mental health facilities but i do not know if they will let someone who runaway stay their without their parents knowledge
i did not have a plan just wanted to see her in person and pay her back after that horrible experience i gave her many years ago
you remain the wonderful person you were and are it is your deep personal relationships persona that i cannot understand or be with
and i am sure it must be possible not to need anyone it can not be that you have to make yourself emotionally dependable on others
everyday just feels like i am waiting for him to come backi thought quite a lot about my relationships i have realised the mistakes that i have made
why is she trying to reach back in my live when she knows better for me there is no difference between direct or indirect massage
so yeah i know suicide is not the answer but i do not really have anything to fight for and i just did not already killed myself because i am too afraid of death
no breakup is more special than another because everyone has been through it all let go of that string that is holding you onto them
i wish it was highschool again because before it was just us now since he has more people like him i just do not know what to even do anymore for friends
i remember that i just used to look through the metal bars of the garden to the street asking myself when were my parents going to come for me while the other kids played
my ex and i were together until my birthday when he texted me at midnight to be the first to wish me happy birthday he had been hyping my birthday for weeks he then picked me up and then took me out to dinner he paid for dinner and then said let us go for a walk i am really full i said sure not thinking anything of it
so many people who are fucking awful as parents end having children why because of an ass i say long distance but it was less than a 3 hour drive the relationship was good
so write down everything that went wrong it could be moments it could events it could be places they treated you badly
alway destroye me when broke up tell with her family i am the reason why she broke up with me
i just had a speculation for a long time and was finally relieved to hear it confirmed by someone a close friend of hers told me that is how i found out i did not even respond when she denied it i just blocked her
of course it is not the end of the world and maybe i am just being sensitive but i put trust in these people because of their being a professional especially
a part of me is okay with it just because it is providential perhaps it is that chance to start anew the one i have been hoping for but since the pandemic situation has gotten a bit better i have been seeing my friends hang out here and there in the city and i have started to feel anxious and left out
she moved back in with my parents has developed extreme ocd her anxiety is through the roof and she might be bipolar doctors disagreed she was proscribed some kind of medication but she is not taking it
it is dark out but the traffic is raging who would notice the small girl out on the road the headlights will only illuminate me when i am gone on the ground still
i try to stay surrounded by friends and keep busy at work which helps immensely but then when i get home i have to drink to keep her off my mind
i know she will probably come back to me i am her something she was able to commit to compared to the life she is living among people just looking for a fun time but even if she does come back i do not think the heartbreak would subside i would only hate myself even more for accepting her again
today is her birthday and all i can think is that i hope she continues to get fatter since i know she is physically lazy and has no drive to lose weight and she becomes more worthless
i am constantly remembering how we laughted at her place in summer what a hapoy day it was and how i thought what a really beautiful person she is
today i asked her if she wanted to talk to me on call she said yea sure but she did not have enough battery i said okay charge your phone
i do not know where to go i think i have friends but they hate me in my mind i think i have family but they wish i was burning in hell right now
all i will do is suffer and ruin everything around me i do not know if i am lazy or just mentally drained or both i am leaning more towards lazy currently
title says it all i also feel like everything would be better if i were not alive i am such a burden and disappointment there is too much with my life that is messed up to enjoy it
i think this happened on thursday but i had a weird thing happen to me they say it is an ear infection but i do not believe them at all anymore
they also most of the time do not even want me near them because of how weird annoying and mean i can be
i do not know what to do with the day or with my life and this therapy is my only hope right now

i was so scared to go the school again that i skipped a lot of lessons and eventually resulting in a lower level for my

hi i just want to get this off my chest because its hurting too much but today i was having a conversation with this person i was so certain was the love of my life and it was not going well and was headed to a split and then he said he thinks we should separate from each other because one time when i was triggered by memories of a toxic relationship i did not care about their intentions and feelings and only thought about myself

i am not that much of an insecure person but when i pay attention to the inside i know that i do not want to be judged by my family and sometimes i end up making decisions that other people want to not be seen as stupid and yesterday i made a decision i wanted but i am still not able to open a text to see what the outcome is
i had to move her out of the house and again try to talk him down and get him to therapy for days but the problem is no one will see him on short notice the meds will not work for a while and worst of all based on everyone i have spoken to and everything i have read on this condition he is a lost because

i apologize if this was all over the place but i wanted to get it off my chest and explain how i felt in some form
when i asked him to let me decide he said he can see that i want more but i feel like i have been stripped off of courage slowly every single day

i want him to run over to my house tears in his eyes apologizing i do not understand how he could just throw me away like that
seems like some are like destined to be alone and lonely i do not believe in any destiny but seems like its impossible for some to change anything to get friends and partners etc and be happy

does anyone know if there is a way to get some kind of insurance that will cover counseling services i have health insurance but it will not cover counseling and it seems like paying monthly for some kind of insurance might be less expensive and actually something i could afford rather than the charges that would come from a counseling professional i live in the us
i started to feel like i was worth it and that i was a great person now that she has gone it seems like all those negative things about me are back and have doubled

i am going to try again and i hope it works this time i literally can not deal with this pain anymore i am over this girl truly
she said she does not know what to say and that she was thinking of ending the relationship this time it felt different
we agreed to stay friends after the break up which i know 100 is not working for me i wish i could just have no contact with him

now i feel propulsed through space with empty thrusters just drifting forward like i do not know how to grow without them
i just do not understand how can he not feel that or is it rejection to tell someone you love them but they do not say it back that guy saw my soul it still makes me tear up today
our hearts reached out without words and our minds felt made for one another it was not long before we confessed our love but it was not perfect that is what made it so strong
i have finally started the process of looking for a therapist does anyone have any advice on what to look for or any red flags i am not sure where to really start
i do not even feel suicidal just it is an itch that desperately needs to be scratched i do have a physical condition but that will go away eventually
it is my fault for thinking anyone would actually love me my fault for being vulnerable with someone who asked me why i let myself be molested at thirteen and was never there for me i am realizing now how dismissive and cruel they were to me i had someone encouraged me to dump them sooner but i cared about them and i thought they cared about me
however why else would he reject me he seems pretty desperate for a relationship so he must think i am not pretty
not a discussion as such more so getting off my chest maybe other adults can give me some insightful life advice
you said that there are so many other girls who deserve it more than you and that there are so many other girls out there that will appreciate it
as with most premature newborns we were severely unhealthy the lead doctor told my mother to me the sickest to save the other

i now am currently in a state in which i am not excercising barely care about details such as my skin condition how i look i still wear the same clothes as i used to so there is not a big difference and i stopped posting anything on social media that i used to do to drag some attention give people the ability to elaborate on our common interests
i think chinese really value those love without any intentions when you are young but i feel americans not i feel americans pay more emphasis on themselves and compatible
as i learned my toxic traits and worked on myself i also find myself to be more open and healthy with this individual
i could not nofuckingmatterwhatinthefuckingfuck would i try or not try do or not do consider or not consider figure out how to solve the problem of complete lack of fulfillment and complete lack whatsoever of love life and any genuine connections and relationships in my life
idk how to explain it but it is like she is telling him that she is his light and him telling her she is his why could not he just man up and admit to me that he still loves her that i was just a rebound

i am so mad at my ex for leaving me when i feel like i needed him the most so i simply said with the calmest growling tone i could muster
this seems to happen every new place i go whether or not there are other new people also going there i do not get it i am just so frustrated and it feels impossible to find friends when it seems like no one else is or had ever been really lonely
i would smile or laugh but it is not genuine and just for show i feel like an observer and do not have many friends just a small group
it sounds dramatic but these thoughts have been getting me worked up for a while now advice reassurance i am not depressed anymore but i am still pretty insecure
i did not do this because she was 17 but rather in spite of that i have no contact with her at all because it was just a random match
part of me wants someone to talk to me on a daily basis again like my ex but that will not happen again the other part just wants to die i guess

i try my best to care about myself and get help therapy meds coking skills etc every day i feel the same and i apply everything learned
our volume was insane and all the covid19 precautions just made everything that much harder any help would be appreciated
also understandable that being with someone who does not do much aside from dreaming of the future of the relationship without trying to turn the dreams into reality is not that good
not that i was daydreaming or allowing my focus to just slip no it was a weird experience i would have my timer for timeboxed work period the minimum of 8 hours i would find myself unable to think about the problem at hand when looking at code i would switch tab to the work time and watch seconds passing by minutes passing by
everyday is the same a never ending cycle of happiness and elation to sadness and anxiety nothing to explain either state just the feeling it is painful
like why in the hell god if he exist i dnt think so would like to have a mount of people here in the earth there is no reason to be alive

but i met this kid m15 14 at the time and had decided to be his friend and we have grown closer recently after we started gaming together on weekends and school breaks
i was feeling really bad about because i knew what i did was wrong but i had no feelings for this other guy and i never even kissed him
it just really ails me that she could not even come to me in person and tell me that she just was not interested anymore
i tried to set up some boundaries for myselfi am a 17 year old boy my dad thinks i do not love him anymore
and lastly do not let yourself get dragged in the whole pyramidscheme of selfdevelopment coursesseminars where some guru will teach you a bunch of cheesy affirmations that you will need to rehearse to the point where you start passionately inhaling your own farts
a terrible selfish souless waste of human flesh i continued to fade in and out for about 30 minutes and then i fell asleep
lately it happened again and this time she is almost left me because of it i am getting tired of thinking this way
along with my mental illness which has been slowly getting better i have physical disabilities i am pretty much a shutin and was even before the coronavirus i am an extreme introvert and do not mind being alone but i guess this year is finally getting too me i have been thinking about there being no one who cares about but i know that is not true there are a few who care
then it takes me a long time to think about how i will write it i have only 30 minutes to write 250 word essay
consequently i cannot seem to ask the same emotional care from my friends that i provide although it is freely given
i have not looked at myself the same way since this happened i do not think i will have anyone else because i can not see myself opening up to anyone again what makes it harder is how i am living alone in a completely different country where i do not know anyone
i was supposed to do my additional tests by the end of the summer break but guess what i failed therefore i would repeat the whole year i did not you might ask why i already did so i got kicked out and sent to a crossroad
if i am walking past people in school i feel to just fight someone but idk why she needed support and i was there and i needed it and she was there
remember that one time you made a surprise for them and they were more interested in thanking their friends rather than you
and she begged me not to tell him we are dating which i thought it was funny because he does not work here
he was not good for me and i did not break up because i was scared it would hurt him yet he ended things with me
i am laughing with my roommate calling my family members checking in on my other friends in case you are wondering how i am doing since you can not reach out i am doing ok
on top of it she says she is doing her best to act normal but i see no effort what should i do and when should i do whatever i should do
for the first time i felt that someone was really carried about me i felt safe he just let me go
i do not want to sound like a victim right now i know there is people out there who share similar feelings with me
all i know is that it still hurts how much i cared about him and that he just did not care as much as i did
3 years later though this great earthquake happened and we lost the place between rubble we almost died if not for an incredible coincidence
there is zero joy now today nor really any day since he made his horrible decision to leave us i do not want to be here but must stay to be there for my husband and other son
now i am lost nothing seems worth doing i do not even enjoy life anymore the light is gone from my life i do not even have a good job nor am what people want me to be in life and it just seems pointless what am i even doing here i am not happy i feel like an oxygen thief
i have been exercising consistently focusing on my studies excelling in my work creating and finding new passions but at the end of the day i just want to experience love again
i never thought about that stuff at all so i do not know where that came from anyways i feel like shit and i am feel betrayed and a lot of resentment towards him
there is no point to this post lol i just felt like posting thoughts i am considering ending it but i am afraid i will fail w the method
listed is some information that tells about me and what is going onmy ex and i been broken up for almost two months
we he decided we would be better as just friends that was 5 days ago same thing again happened two more times until 7 am
i can not cuddle with her anymore i can not tell her how much i love her anymore i can not kiss her anymore i can not snuggle with her anymore i can not call her anything that is not her name anymore i can not hear her say she feels safe and that she feels like nothing can hurt her anymore i can not hear her laugh in the same way anymore i just can not anymore
he broke up with me this time because he said it was morally irresponsible to stay with me and that he just was not ready
now i do not talk to my mother because of an argument was before i knew she was the because of my problems and it is hard to process it
sometimes i genuinely do not feel like talking but most of the time i wish i could just talk and just let it all out but i hate the idea of doing it because i just feel like i am whining or almost feel like a burden i guess or that people will just be annoyed
what if now that i found out i like girls i will also like little girls what if i still like torture and would like to inflict pain on someone else
one day they will stumble across one maybe these memories will hit them like that breeze on the beach long enough to remember but not strong enough to break through
on the evening of december 12th i sat on my bed trying to decide whether i should stay at home and hurt myself or i should admit myself to the hospital i had been in a downwards spiral for the past few months and had reached a point where i had lost all motivation to keep pushing forward
i loved him so much and got so little in return i am 36 years old and in relationship but lonely so lonely
i have pushed myself since this time of being alone to take hobby classes get jobs study and go out and about on my own even though it feels odd i took a solo trip across the country i went on a date did group therapy and volunteered and after all that i sit here and realise none of those experiences lead to a friendship
i guess i just need advice on what to do now i still have feelings for him but i do not think i should hold on all my friends are not really being helpful with this situation
and now to same things i need to listen shit in my head listen shitty people minds around me doing the same stuff all together and i sooo tired
i have always been extremely lonely if i ever make any friend at all i already know that it is going to be a very shortlived relationship
getting older might mean i am closer to moving away from my father but part of me wants to stay i feel helpless because i feel alone
what also helped is that i have not texted him and muted his social media profile i accidentally saw him through someone elses snapchat story and got emotional for like an hour
sorry to vent herei just feel like crying and i just do not have any clue as to why this should be a happy jolly celebratory time
smile else everyone will see you as a boring creep or at worst a guy with an attitude as if i even hav something to be egoistic about
but i just have this mentality even for myself that things could always be worse so why complain about them i might just be ranting here but i just want to be able to have a positive mindset again
as i mentioned i come from a big family so since i moved in with her i also took the problems of my dysfunctional family with me
i do not know what to do since i care about him but i also do not want a 71 yo rich lady to get hurt either that he is been seeing as a friend but she really likes him a lot
but i know refusal will only get my dad involved so i accept she would say mean and horrible things to me
a few days ago maybe a week i tried to practise killing myself i set it up inside and managed to get it to work so i was hanging but i was afraid to put weight on my neck in case i changed my mind but now i know i can do it i know how to set it up so it will work
nothing has a point or any meaning when i used to want to die i thought that is what it felt like to be suicidal
after seeing the world from afar begin to observe it closer slowly at your own pace drill down from the clouds and mountain tops down to the city streets the serene villages and lastly the people around and in these areas
not a no not a yes just silence just to make it clear or send me a video in which you eat it that would be fun
when i was at his flat even though we settled on what to cook earlier in the day he decided not to participate in the cooking process when we wanted to do it as he just did not feel like it however behind my back he criticized my potatoes and called them shit i rarely hear him use such words usually never but this is what he told the housemate
in short a healthy form of selflove is all about the right intentions not necessarily the actions you takehope you liked this little excerpt full longform posts can be found right herehttpsmaxjancarcom on my blog
do i give her space or i do just think that she is moving on already and i move on as well i do not know what to do
not only because i am never emotionally prepared for what i am walking into but because i am constantly tip toeing around every single person
not long after i made ties with them one of the guys my brother hangs out with just joined a gang as a way of taking revenge on his previous dad who punched his mom and him daily
i know i can delete every app off my phone whilst my accounts just sit there but that would not remove the temptation to check them every so often
i reached out to my recent ex gf this morning off a texting app because she has my real number blocked and she had nothing nice say
you hated how selfless i was how different i was from you as you would not dare do the things i would do how much i would do for literally anyone without expectation of anything in return
i let you into every corner of my life and now there is nowhere to turn without seeing your face it is not over just because you are gone
at first she had a we either break up or continue working on stuff together but no breaks position but let up after letting her know that i either needed a break or we would call it off
on top of it i really miss this guy i will never see again it is weird how some people leave a deep impact and then you are never the same

being true about how i feel when it ended not that i am saying to beg but make sure they know what you think
when they are not good over and over again eventually even the smallest hint or sign that they might happen again leads to what looks like an exaggerated emotional response from the outside or to anyone involved in desperate attempt to prevent the thing from happening in that moment and in the futureon the face of it it might seem illogical but dig a little deeper and it can make total sense
i feel so stupid for asking for help now i feel like i am making things up and just fishing for attention

life is all about living and you can not live when your sad you can not live sitting there waiting for someone who will not come around

creating an artificial and toxic sense of solidarity by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person while either directly or indirectly encouraging their selfloathing emotions and selfdestructive impulses since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation

its selfish for people to force people to stay alive for that reason i truly believe that there should be a medical option to kill yourself through lethal injection if you want
i am tired of living and dealing with the constant thought of not being enough or ever good enough for myself or anyone

i looked after her and made sure she was constantly doing well eating as she is really skinny etc a few days later i was the third lowest grade class

i just came out of a 2 yr rlts 4 days agoi know you still feel that love for me raw authentic love
i am starting to become more open to the idea of getting closer to my ex again it is been a year my best friend feels that i made the right decision to leave based on what i have told her and also based on her own opinion that he is not attractive i normally do not care what anyone thinks but she and our mutual friends have said they felt i was settling
is it even possible for me to find someone else when my experience with meeting my ex and love for him was so strong i am over my ex in the sense that i do not want to be with him anymore but i just feel like what i had was so amazing and rare i might never get that again
not sure how long it will take but i know i must keep trying i treated her like my own child and i never once abandoned her until that moment
i kept drinking smoking heavily just looking at the ceiling and wondering when will this end i was never really the best i think i was a shut out and never talked to anyone i live alone and i genuinely just slowly killing myself
i have no idea why he would end it i have no idea why he would be so sad and upset in the process
i do not know how to make friends and when i make one something happens with me that i do not think i want to be with them
whoever she was talking to she did not want me to know because i saw she was deleting texts right before she turned the phone away
it is been several weeks since the break up after a few monthes where my bf had severe depression due to his addictions he took the decision to end things while i wanted to be on his side during this terrible period even though it was really rough for me
after breakup first week i cried every night and next week i felt totally fine surprised myself until he started to change his mind time and time again
but this 8th grade year turned for the worse when my friend found this other boyand yet today was the last straw
then i come home and i am all alone no one to confide in except my boyfriend i have been severely depressed since i was a kid like very small
once he put on the magenta pixie video on tv which he wanted to show us he started criticizing my attitude how i was not opening up
and they all get good grades i feel everything but normal i am not sure but i think just the first two reason are enough to be happy
i finally felt so happy after a very long time funnily enough i felt he was more into me at first than i was into him
is it normal and am i just being dramatic it is been eating away at me for months now but it is getting worse and i feel like i am just overreacting or being dramatic
no matter how much i wish it were the case i was not built to exist in isolation i need other people to survive
when you make the mistake of putting your confidence into anything you lose your confidence because you are now relying on that thing to make you feel confident
no matter what happened and would never want anyone but him he is the love of my life1 it is hard for me to open wrapper of chocolate or chips properly
this would be the second time id have tried i just do not want to hurt anyone but i know it will
i can not shake the feeling of being sad i feel like crying my eyes get heavy and can feel tears forming but nothing lately i cannot focus on anything my attention span last about 15 seconds i do not know why i am so sad and have no idea how to feel normal writing this makes me want to cry even more
she hate or dislike all my friends girls are the most she only like whom can give me a job
we are both the kind of people that are bad with feelings we both tend to bottle them up and deal with them on our own so i had no idea he was suicidal the last few months i have noticed he has been acting very different he did a few things that made me a little disappointed in him but after talking to his gf this morning it is all making sense
i know that depression anxiety and other mood disorders can affect anyone regardless of their apparent happiness affluence or physical attractiveness
anyway i have been a tool fan since 12 born in 1990 when i found this ominous tape in my fathers collection with the human body cut in half and strange logo that said tool
hem27 was the first person i f24 decided to meet from the app so i was skeptical but wow oh wow did we hit it off
however with this going it is like i will attempt to do so and the thought gets completely jumbled in my head
1 i feel like i can not help enough people i lost my friend at age 10 to suicide and i always have felt like i am responsible i now take everyone elses mental health on my shoulders and it makes me sick i do not know how to care for myself and i just cry every night
note this is just a rant you all do not need to share your feelings she told her friend and they both just came at me out of nowhere for it
it is not that i do not have friends but my friendships are what you might call i am in the orlando fl area any recommendations the doctors needs to accept bcbs insurance and does fmla paperwork
two days ago the voice spoke out of my bathroom door even though i live alone i asked the voice what it was it said just a voice in your head
my moms youngest sister invited me over for dinner and i told her about my being unemployed she stared lettingng me know when she had extra leftovers and snuck me a 20 here and there
i feel trapped in an existence i never wanted to be in and forced to be the best version of myself even though i hate myself
this had never happened to me before i would have these small jerks in my neck and they started to really hurt
i feel like i compare every girl to melanie especially with jordan the situations are so similar and it always sat in the back of my mind
another thing that i have had enough of is social anxiety why can not i have as much fun as other people why is there always something preventing me from driving to starbucks just because i do not want to interact with the employee i deserve to live a normal life and not be prevented from doing so
anyway as the title says what is it about a drug like zoloft or any ssri that causes such random uncontrolled very much unwanted thoughts in addition to the other things like the brain zaps dizziness etc my understanding is that all these drugs do is create a glut of serotonin in the brain due to the action of blocking reuptake therefore serotonin builds up from not getting used up and withdrawal symptoms come from the sudden dip in serotonin levels zoloft in particular has a very short half life and does not stay in the body very long so serotonin drops more quickly in the absence of the drug than other ssris
i am in the lowest point of my life therapy does not work i am swimming in debt my salary barely covers anything i am nc with my father i am obese my mother wants me as far away as posible my baby brother who i love more than anything in the world was raped and i can not do shit about it i wasted a fuckton of money and willpower in a career i am not even good at my father let his friend sexually harass me i can not even look myself at the window and despite everything i am stupid coward that is scared of the pain of killing myself
just had our christmas gathering yesterday at lunch with my dads side of the familyi had a hard time conversing with everyone
cleaning and other things at home no motivation to do it this is obviously an issue at home as my wife while very understanding can not do it all
i am really really sad this time i feel so horribly alone i am a transgender woman i have been out for 3 years and transitioned like a lot of people this year has been an absolute shit show with friends of friends dying relatives getting sick and almost dying losing all semblance of normal life and on and on
i hope the cold hole in my chest leaves and the negative thoughts in my head disappears so for context we were both aware of consequences of actions towards each other
she told me how much she appreciated me as a person and that she was not going anywhere we both are very intuitive and emotionally expressive individuals which is why i think we connected so well
and it makes me impossible to read or do any activity or even relax i literally can not read anymore i am afraid i need to fix this right away if this goes on i will fail in school and in lifei can not study can not read can not focus can not relax can not do any activity i can not do anything
she was drunk and in my opinion confused she hugged me and kissed my hand i kissed her forhead and we went to sleep together and hugged again
with all of your scars on your soul all that power all that passion and everything you were beautifuljust let me go and have and endless dream please it is for the best
hello everyone i have been feeling very off for a few years now and i decided to ask around for some help
i will not spend hours playing video games with him i will not laugh with him until my rib cage hurts
we see eachother once a week because he lives 1 hr and a half away and is usually busy with college but we always enjoy the time we are together and we text everydaycall
i guess i am just having one of those nights where i am very aware that it is me with me forever
it is been so many years it is all friendly small talk with nice strangers it was great but after it was over i felt really guilty
a woman will come by and see you for what an amazing and caring person you are under your jaded cynical misanthropic exterior
in the middle i feel like i am the most myself because things are normal my therapist says it is anxiety and i guess it is but the treatment is not helping it stop
plus i find a letter has way more style and you are a bookworm we kill two birds with one stone
she had a very bad time similar to mine when she was a child now she is very happy i feel like i have lost my home
so we met and we talk she basically said that she just felt like she would not have been happy long term
best thing ever and instead of talking to me about an issues she just pushed me away and went to her other guy friend to have an open relationship with which i knew would never last because he did not care about her mental health like everyone else
or when she just wanted to talk to other people because we have been doing the same routine every fucking day that i thought felt meaningful but was starting to be a chore for her but i stopped her and accused her of things she did not do
i thought after our convo yesterday that i was feeling better but i woke up and realized that that feeling is hope
now imagine them holding your face close and they come close to your ear to whisper you i will alwaysbe there goodbye babe
i read a lot of books i was quiet and pensive i made good grades but never was very good at making friends
i have gone four days without talking to her and it kills me but i think distance is the best option especially if i want to get back with her
my family has been checking on me but gave me space when i asked but they all want me to talk abou it i want to go to therapy but only if it is online but i am not comfortable with talking about this with anyone except my mother as i do not have a close relationship with the rest of my family i barely know them
and then i feel like every single horrible thing i went to through is deserved because this life is stolen and does not belong to me
here i am for the third time in my life dealing with a breakup and the second time in my life with a painfully broken heart and wondering what the fuck i could have done differently then i noticed an unfortunate common denominator among my three breakups the time of year when they happened
what can i do to change that i have no idea i am useless she is seeing a psychiatrist next week before you ask
i started doing it and had a panic attack because it is just so messy and now i am having a panic attack about how messy it is and panicking that i had a panic attack because i feel like i am going to die
i am a covid long hauler and it is forced me to clean up health i am cleansing my body now and the cleansing process is causing a natural reaction in the body that results in anxiety and depression for a short period of time and dealing with postcovid symptoms is depressing enough
honestly i am the type of person who would just go on despite the beatings but when it comes to that aspect of life i am terrified
i am very interested in mental disorders for some reason because i feel like i have something worse than my doctors think maybe because i have gotten so good at hiding it over the course of my life
we did the whole dancei have felt sick for weeks and want her and all of that back any tips would be nice
hello all i am wondering about some background of people here as far as reason origin of loneliness most days i will get off work and lie in bed in my room with little motivation to get up
when you are in a long term relationship for some time the values beliefs and goals you and your partner share start to intertwine
i am home from college in massachusetts and my therapist at schools license does not extend to new york she suggested that i see a therapist and maybe a psychiatrist here
i feel like i am deprived of insights i know i have my own but this one i hold seem to drain me i am sure there is other ways of looking at it it is difficult finding people talk deeply with my post history is one example of how pathetic i have tried other than that feeling alone while feeling lost just sucks it is this warmth i am craving and i am freezing
at the end of september we decided that he would come down to my apartment for 5 days for us to hangout
and yet he was so angry when i blocked him angry enough to come to me in person about it angry enough to complain to our mutuals about it
i was inconsiderate she needed time to heal from what happened and our relationship was tying her downi have really tried looking up why i have this behaviour but it is really hard to find anything about it
he is kind caring smart funny and we have many similar interests i feel physically sick even just thinking about him talking to another girl like he talks to me
what would you do if you lived in a world with no people and loneliness were to be a part of your nature
my anxiety and wanting to show her how much she meant to me i feel pushed her away for good and i may never have a chance to speak to her again
i begin to play mental movies in my head where i picture them with others and create scenarios worse than what probably happened
it is so humiliating to write this but i do not know what else to do the therapists i have seen have all made it worse and medication always sends me into a tailspin
sorry for the depressing post on a day that is supposed to be joyousi am 22yearsold and i take care of my disabled mother
update i talked to him and just told him about how i felt with his actions he apologized i fully expected but i know he was not trying to because harm he told me again about how he had been feeling we only dated for a few months so we are just going to go back to friends
but then i think about if i leave my dog he would probably be depressed miss me a lot and just idk i do not want that for my dog
tw i struggle with cyclothimic disorder depression and am a recovering addict latley i have been feeling so empty and unfulfilled in general i can not shake the feeling
i just wish i was not so lazy with studying and projects though nothing really makes me happy anymore recently i have been thinking about becoming a game designer
specifically schizotypal or avoidant i will be seeing a doctor as soon as possible but i want to hear the opinion of someone here who knows more than me as i find some of my symptomsindicators of pd rather unique
i have really done everything i can and tried everything that seemed reasonable to me if this j pouch surgery does not increase my life quality dramarically i have nothing left to live for
and remember your why this goes not only for streaming but for lifei am not playing the victim mentality here if you are hurt you are hurt
i am currently in a toxic relationship and am not in a place where i feel safe having the first move on a break up
the way he looked at me and smiled i did not want to seem crazy if i was wrong here but i was still very doubtful
she is never going to fully love me again and here i am alone more than three hours away from my family bawling on the floor by myself
i feel like a robot meant to do the job where can i find someone i would be able to spend hours talking withsoulmate
i kept the appartment with a lot of things being hers since her parents live like 15 minutes away so the major point of the meeting is to see how we share the stuff how she will empty our past bedroom so i can try to find a roommate
draw yourself letting go of your ex whatever that means for you you can make a picture of yourself gently pushing her away you can express yourself being alone and happy or you can draw an old version of yourself dead on the floor and the other new version standing tall and with a smile next to it draw what resonates with you
i suffer from so many things including severe fatigue extreme pain in my gut and severe headaches to name a few
anyone else in the same position if so are the distractions working for you not looking for a new relationship by any means just looking to distract myself
my ex 26m broke up with me 25f a few weeks ago we ended on very good terms and it was upsetting for both of us he did not give an exact reason as to why he ended it
at first she tells me she is not going to share what they talked about but she just sees how hurt i am and straight up tells me
so yeah i guess i am not actively suicidal it has been worse to the point that i might do it right now but it is still on my mind it has not not been all year it used to be more passive and less around
that is the thing i do not even know for sure if i had one i may have but i may have turned it in and not gotten a replacement so i may not have even had one i am pretty sure i did but maybe i did not
i need some advice i do not really know where to go from here we broke up a year ago but were in contact on and off
i still lost him and i wish that we could go back i wish that he would come back but he has not and it is been two months
rather vague title i know but it is a metaphor that hopefully some will understand my breakup did not happen today but still lives rentfree in my mind and hopefully hopefully will be eased with the help of others
she was playing animal crossing with this guy and i was blowing up her phoneis it weird if i like my exs tweet about holding hands
if we possibly find love long term relationship she seemed so perfect for me i felt truly loved for once
it is harder now when my psychiatrist is taking a break during the holidays so can not speak to him either about all this
help sorry if the flair is wrong btw which it probably is7 months ago my boyfriends friends invited my best friend and i to hangout
yes there is beauty and love and joy in the world and such things are real and important but in my experience they are fickle and pale in comparison to the omnipotent omnipresent capacity of human evil
people tell me they are a text away if i get suicidal that if i am feeling like i am going hurt myself it is okay to tell them about it yet to my experience whatever bring it up or ask for help my friends run like i have contracted the plague
he stopped talking to me forever he does not care about me anymore if i am dead or alive so i am not sure what i will do about that yet
he also said i kept saying he was going to leave i realize these problems and i am in therapy now for him
this alone made me incredibly happy because i defied reality and am going to be a momma as time went on i got bigger and felt my child within me and finally gave birth
anyway this apathy thing has made me increasingly more and more lazy i completely lack motivation to do anything which my severe social anxiety does not helpwhich i know is weird considering the apathy that i feel yet another confusing contradiction for me to probably never figure out
i got angry again and when she got up to use the bathroom i grabbed the extra sheets and started to make the bed
i was thinking at least 3 times a day about how would i end it all i was a coward tho
i make people laugh i hang around people i put myself out there it feels like nobody wants me nobody has texted me since spring break march 17th
no one can go out today they are too hungover and i just want to keep the party going i feel more lonely than ever i keep having these paranoid thoughts that they are all just hanging out without me
as well as the crippling anxiety i have a lot of trouble regulating my emotions if something unexpected happens no matter how small it will set me off i either get upset and cry or i have to remove myself from everything and kind of shut down noise overwhelms me especially things like loud talking and screaming
i am ready to do it i have noone to live for who cares who does not i do not carei always wanted to write a nice autobiography but you would call it a suicide note
i have never had a real life friend i do not know what it is like to genuinely spend time with people
lost for comfort he turns to harmless substitutes for love that ask no questions but loving is a twoway process and in the end the substitutes are not enough
a boy that i loved left me for a new girl i barely speak to my friends anymore my family is always busy and everyday i go about my day not even talking to a single soul
i saw that coming so i was kind of prepared but in my heart i know he still loves me we both just need time a looong time to heal and maybe one day try everything again
i do not know sorry for the rant but i am so mentally drained it was rough i had to call emergency services to take him away for the last time
but he did not reciprocate nearly as muchonce your inner world changes you actively seek out the outer world that reflects those changes
i have come to post here for reasons i can not quite understand it is not in attempt to persuade myself not to nor inform others
hi i do not know why i am doing this but here i am what if i still like torture and would like to inflict pain on someone else
now s has some mental health issues she would often go into these depressive states where she would sleep for long periods of time and not shower i thought the dog could help with that too since it would give her something cute and full of love to focus on
the other half is proud of myself for getting out of abusive relationship when i was younger i used to have an issue with codependency
i once dropped a bit of chocolate ice cream on his pillow on the sofa i said ups and got up in order to clean it in the bathroom
she misscaried them all and they were not fully developed and they were stillborn puppies she started to get very sick and eventually she died
however our sales guy who sets up most of the work i do refuses to understand and just says i am lazy
to that end i have had more casual encounters with girls than romantic and that is because i do not trust them to not end up being problematic in some way
to try and experiment with drugs the first time they got drunk and did cocaine the second time it was ecstacy
it runs around in my head until i can not take it anymore and i breakdown into a fit of complete silence
but that would last for some minutes or half an hour but soon i would be back to square one it is as if i was getting the message no
i have zero friends and i can not stand my family i wish i had a boyfriend or even just a friend i could go to and just leave my awful house
i tried so hard to be there for you to support you when your depression came around i have never felt so much rage at someone as i do with them
it feels wrong to give them to someone else i want him to have them maybe one day we can be friends but not now
i feel the urge to push people away for no reason i just can not talk to anyone i feel so disconnected from everyone and everything nothing feels right i do not want to push people away but it just feels like it is the only thing i can do
and that really saddens me because i still care and worry about him and i just want him to be happy
i do not want to face living my life in the future knowing i will just fail harder and spiral downwards in this shit hole
i broke down in tears and asked him to leave my room and go to his when i first told him i was raped he had no problem with it
i met her when i was 20 and she was 24 we got engaged about a year in a half ago
i feel so sad and anxious about it all and feel this kind of slight pressure on my chest when i think about it and i just want to cut myself and cry and maybe i could say it is because it is that time of the month but i do not know maybe i am overreacting
i have good grades i have a nice family i have supportive friends i have a girlfriend i still do not know why i can not see myself as someone great
it is kind of like the numb point and it is been happening lately or just random super awareness that we are just one tiny spec on this petri dish called earth
i really did try but something was just missing and it cannot be helped we are not solitary animals and i am human
i feel rly bad for every person knowing me wish i could just dissapear without anyone noticing as silent as possible
and it is been really frustrating and harmful for me going to her house incredibly stresses me out and causes me to have horrible anxiety and anxiety is a major trigger for me selfharming which my mom knows about despite that and despite me
i am holding onto hope that one day we will find each other when we are both ready and that will be forever am i crazy for believing this or is there maybe a chance would love to hear other experiences
i guess this is just a vent but if anyone reads this and feels they have something to say in response i would be more than happy to listen thank you x
i will try to keep this as short as i can i am really just reaching out for some advice and if anyone has any i honestly really do appreciate it
so i am 19f and social media is quite obviously a part of my life i would not say i am addicted to it like others my age but i feel like i can not walk away from it
he cancelled on me christmas eve and has sent 10 messages max since i do not know what is happening i think it is over this is so hard
like would it be okay for them to cuddle in bed when i am not there because she needed the comfort he flipped out within 2 minutes of me talking screamed at me in front of the entire bar that this is ridiculous and he is not doing this now and left
my partner and i have spent almost every night with each other since we met and lately it is been every night it is been incredible because it is given me the warmth of having someone that i never had when i was a child
i now know it is not that i did not trust him it was because i was struggling with trusting myself so much stuff has happened that we are both unhappy
it is like i am a plant nice in the background when it is there but does not feel like a loss when it is not
he was a successful lawyer and all around good guy before succumbing to madness for the record he has never been violent nor involved in any kind of crime that i am aware of
i have been doing really good before i found out as i have been processing my emotions like a 95 job but it still hurts
not going to see any family at all this year because of covid i do not have too many friends the ones i do i hardly see not sure how i am going to do not going to work or having anyone around to interact with during my jobs holiday break maybe i should look into volunteering
i rejected as i wanted to know him moreeven through all rumours or lies he made me smile even when twice or thrice

i just wish i could forget i wish i could move on how long should you wait after a relationship to sleep with someone else

i happily agreed to the change and she kept telling me not to worry about it this past week i wake up everyday wishing i was dead
at twentyfivei think i moved across the entire us to get away from them with my then girlfriendfiance in retrospect it was a doomed relationship while i cared for her my desire to get away from my family mattered more i had grown to hate them
i will spend the rest of my life trying to encourage anyone i can and also get it when i need it
i guess i am just kind of scared that i am not working through my feelings in the right way whatever that means
i am stupid have zero talent and am just a waste of resources the older i get the worse life seems to get with no signs of ever getting better
we have had so many conversations where we try and tell eachother what we need but tbh i just feel like a lot of the time they just resent me
i imagine you have easily moved on since you have not looked back and you were so sure this was the right decision
i feel like i do not even have control over this she alway said she is special and i can not never find a girl like her
i am not allowed to be depressed because i have it too good according to my mind i am so tired of my life right now
all the situations have been a repeating cycle where i will talk to a girl for months but i always get scared to really go for it in fear of rejection
only it is backfired as they have found out he is breached his bail and i feel really awful i have had to tell them
i feel screwed i have the constant feeling that nobody cares that my existence is null in their lives and i feel that death is the only way out
side note i truly believe in her word they ask me to be more open but when i am they berate me for it
hello everyone and hope you all are holding up on what you are going through i texted her telling her its over forever
i had a nervous breakdown and started having suicidal thoughts called an ambulance just in caseand i fucked it up just like i do with everythingwe broke up right before the holidays started
can anyone relate to this has anyone found ways to get better or improve i am really looking for hope but everything seems bleak
i have started to gain weight and lose motivation to do my chores i have an irrational fear of upsetting my step dad
2 years ago i was divorced single mother one day my old friend send me a message since i do not know when asking how i am doing
at the very least it makes sense to change the method of suicide i just need to rant this out somehow
he blamed it on the long distance and uni and other stuff but we have been together for almost 3 years and those excuses did not affect us before
me 23f and my ex 23m have just broken up 2 days ago after 4 years together because he did not feel the same way about me anymore
at 330am she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that she wanted to kill herself because she always managed to fuck something up and that she left god and god left her a long time ago and a whole symphony of guilt flowed out of her
i hate that in the end i am still the bad guy and the toxic ex that got too clingy even if that was only because i had to ask for basic fucking respect and just a little bit of time and support from the person that became my world despite being halfway across it
i know i have to move on and start to give myself value and love myself i wish i could recover real soon and feel fine now
i still love you and you do not feel the same and that is ok but i need someone in my life who is willing to stick by my side no matter what
the first thing i noticed about him was when other women would approach him in the group we were in saying they hoped he would message with them he never seemed to act like he cared or noticed
therefore i have recently decided to take action and i have identified three resources to guide my journey the first of which is reaching out to a psychologist to help better understand my particular situation
that was another big reason that i got dumped if you are having a hard time with motivation check it out hang in there and keep doing the things
i really do not need to your guys support or encouragement and please do not tell me to see a psychologist if by any chance someone read the whole rant congratulations to you
i have asked him to block me to stop me from reaching out to him and he said he would but has not
to watch someone slowly fall out of love with you or to be the one who slowly falls out of love with that person
hey guys i love being in my room way too much it is literally my sanctuary and i know others can agree and i have been told by my parents that i need to come more and just not be in there often
what can i do i just wish i had something to do on my days off besides watch crunchyroll for hours on end
he is furious and not even a single percent of hope is left for me but she wants to be together even though she is telling that there is no future for us
he was taking his frustrations out a lot on the dog and myself which also messed me up mentally i have lived a decent life up to this point 25m
some people are alone maybe because they have lost someone or did not find the right friends or they had bad past experiences and do not have trust in people anymore
i feel like i am dying i am not doing too great in my studies i hope if i die i can be free finally
about a month ago this girl started talking to me through some language learning app and we became a pseudocouple we started talking everyday having regular video chats sharing photos getting a bit intimate etc etc things have been good but lately the relationship has deteriorated to a point that i want to end it
i woke up with my father telling me that my ex gf was waiting for me outside crying well i just relapsed again today of all days
i am so lonely inside and i see everyone living their good lives with their friends having fun while i sit at home doing jacksh1t getting fatter and fatter as i speak
i live in a country that i feel like an alien in although i am born and raised on a little island in asia
it is only been three weeks since i was dumped and i feel better our relationship was not perfect but there is no such thing as a perfect relationship if there is one thing i have learned from this is that she showed me i could love someone with my whole heart and treat her the way i was raised to treat someone whom i deeply cared about it has been difficult without a doubt but i am getting better
i have been fortunate enough that this lockdown helped me connect with someone online and once the full lockdown was lifted in my country we met irl and it is going well
i love him so much but the future seems so bleak and it will be so hard for him but i love him and i do not want to lose him
sometimes in the hardest of days i found the best way to get me to care for myself shower make food brush teeth clean room etc was to imagine myself as a small child i do not know if this is an odd thing to do but it is worked for me so maybe it will work for you dr seuss up in this bih
i can not really move back home because i have a difficult relationship with my mumnow i find myself upset and mad
i just told him i have a 3 month time span with ppl after month 3 they leave he would not give me his cup
so from that day my life is like pain game never ends like i am worthless of his love and that he is better off without me
my sense of loneliness feels more pronounced when i do not have anyone to do things with or travel with or just do something i like now technically if i look hard enough i could find someone but then again do i want that particular person so loneliness can also be confusing about what or who we want i know i feel that way
this guy started swimming under the ice in a search for answers to his grief after his schizophrenic wife killed herself leaving him with 4 6 kids many years ago
i just broke with my girlfriend and thinking well about that she was the only one who always stayed with me in all my fking stupid life
but she has changed and pretty much been rubbing it in my face that she is dating someone else and i should not have to deal with that
my ibs has gotten worse and my whole body is in pain i can not live like this anymore what can i do to change that i have no idea
for a long time you were the one we talked about the future and what life had in store for us you would tell me your dreams after waking up about us getting married how you never wanted kids and never wanted to get married but that i made you want those i made you want to live a dream you never dreamt of to have a family that did not consist of you and a dog
but 2 days ago her mom found out that we started to date again and it is really really really unfortunate it actually ended like that again
i was sent a letter to inform me that i could continue my benefits but it would come at a price
i had helped him move out of the house he shared w ex wife and now mom helped him move into an apartment with his mom
but i do understand it nowand i hope your ideas about how it is impossible to ever be happy in lifedo not get ramped up by your ideal form of what happiness is
i hate how things are right now i am not sure they will improve but i hope they do i feel used to some extent but you can not always help having feelings for certain people
why did i have to be born like this why do i have to suffer everyday why does everyone hate me and find me weird even my parents do not like me
and now since i took so much and did not vomit i am suspicious about why i am alive today or if i am really alive you know i feel like crap this morning but not nearly as crap as i should given what i did to myself that or more crap than if it had worked
i asked him to block me so he would not feel bothered but he has not and has been leaving me on read i know should not have but when i went on his twitter he said you just got to let people grieve in their own way
i have been feeling empty for few weeks and it is really a struggle for me i can get myself to do things but i do not feel like anything i do is fulfillingenjoyable
its not like birthdays were special for me or something but this time it is going to be different i know that he is not going to wish me for my birthday
we have been seeing a worrying increase in prosuicide content showing up here and and also going unreported this undermines our purpose here so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide
i thought i might have gotten out of the pattern with that new group but in the end it always ends the samei always have made freinds but they always had other friends in a group when i would try to hang out with them i got slowly pushed out bc i did not fit the norm i have tryed everything but everytime it ended the same and i would lose everything
but why are you so fucking afraid to live for yourself for us why are so you scared of living out our relationship in peace was not that the goal for us for the past 5 years from spending time in our cars away at airbnbs at my house in the city for privacy did not we deserve peace
i just want it to end i am so done with constantly feeling fucking sad i have s good life but my thoughts have been here for years no matter what happens it is always there in the back of my mind i can not even trust myself anymore i just do not want to have a third failed attempt
in summer of 2019 i hit my lowest and on two occasions i was ready to commit suicide thankfully i did not go through with it
we have the same interests and love doing the same things we rarely fight and if we do it is a small stupid disagreement
he told me he is a better man for his new girlfriend and owes it to me he is honest with everything he has loyal and appreciates her
i hope this encourages you all that everything happens for a reason and everything does get better if you need someone to talk to please feel free to pm me i would be more than happy to talk with you guy or girl
so yeah this is it i guess actually excited to go to the store and buy rope tomorrow and do what i have wanted to do since i was a kid i have done pressure tests before and know exactly how to make it so i pass out and do not come back
i have done bad things in our relationship and i know that maybe sometimes i overreacted sometimes i could not give you the support you needed but i loved you
similarly if you have a thought and if you do not like that thought i am jealous that he is even thinking about giving her a christmas gift
it is a sad state of affairs when you are watching mr bean sending christmas cards to himself and knowing his only friend is his teddy bear
please someone respond i just need some support and some answersi do not have meds on i do not do any drugs or drink
i want to here from you out there who might be feeling the same way and not hear bs comments like never give up or whatever
plus he used the app just to talk to me and his other old childhood friend so what other reasons for him to redownload the app so many time
i have these thoughts in my head hence they define my behaviour and i avoid people because of feeling super ashamed
anyways i think it is unhealthy if we all go too long of periods without touching another person physically it really has an effect on your mind and well being
tldr want to stop using social media do not want to delete accounts because of memories but also want to remove the temptation and do not see another way to do so what do
he dint even discussed what was in his mind i have realized that my happiness had completely became dependent on my relationships with people around me
it is not like i make a ton of money or have a bunch of power or anything like that it is just a field i have no experience in and never envisioned or wanted to be in
we had been together for about nine months we met online and it was long distance we never got to meet but i felt like i already knew him
much of his money on the line just for me he was there when i introduced to my former friendship when i realized that they dragged him through the mud let his character be attacked because i wanted to please them he did not say anything for he told me that he was quiet because he loved me even if i did not understand fully they were asking questions of him in good faith
i have ocd and i suffer badly from intrusive thoughts i never thought i would live with so many regrets and i am not even 30 yet
i normally will start berating myself for some thought process going on in my head it was brighter with him here
that brings us to my personal life at home where i did nothing all day but play games with my online friends
it is gotten to a point we are i always have to lie about myself and my well being to my parent to make them decently pleased with me
anyway the point of this post i feel so gross and unworthy that it physically depresses me to see images of guys i am attracted to for instance i am a huge bts fan but i can not look at them or listen to them anymore because i feel so gross that i am not worthy of even seeing people that look so good that i need to return to the shadows from whence i came
if anyone has tips and tricks up their sleves on how to get over this and be a saner version of oneself feel free to share the same with me it would be immensely helpful as i seem to have hit a personal roadblock
i have always felt like i was barely a human because of how deeply lacking i am when it comes to impulse and connecting thoughts to actions it is so bad at times that i can not even verbally respond to people because the neurons never even fire for me to open my mouth so i have never been someone who struggled with overwhelming impulsiveness or urges like this until now
my mother does not want to get a divorce from him even though the appartment is legally hers and me and my brother are old enough to choose who we would like to stay with
everyone is going through a tough time stay together and love each other everybody really needs it right now christmas this year will not be easy nor is it impossible even if christmas eve was not what you wanted it can still be better on christmas day
although i have grown immensely and i am the most consistently solidly happy i have ever been in my entire life i still think of him often
i added him on game profile to see if they still play together since my ex removed me from friends but i did not think he will tell her that someone random added him and what i got is her message on facebook asking me wtf am i doing why am i adding him
i just want to be the exuberant guy that i have always been who has a lot of passion a mind full of crap but also full of wonder but it seems like i am the only that sees that magic that is burning inside
i do not think about if it will hurt or how people will feel after i am gone i think about that sometimes at night for a few minutes
i also hate online school because i can not meet people and i have tried to make friends but it is really hard to actually have someone like me
another thing that might help is to imagine what if what you are worried about is really happening no parties with friends no bowling with friends
cfkfnfbfnbc a simple text to tell me you did not want to talk and end on good terms was all you had to say
i feel very obsolete lost every day is a new day but every day i feel the same i have no physical energy or motivation really i can not hold a conversation with anybody not like i want to i feel like a hallow she will
that is what happens in life you can not forget the love and the tenderness you share with someone the memory is preserved in your body as you held that person inside of your heart and it stays but keeps drifting on ashore making you into a person you are today
a week in and i am going numb the depression has always been there now its showing go away stop feeling that is all my mind goes through daily wake up realize its not a shitty dream get better by lunch and night time right back down the hill
my wife and i had our struggles but we always got through but i let my student depression and low selfesteem tell me she did not love me anymore so i started seeking attention in the form of chatting to another women it naturally got found out and on top of our problems that was the last straw
the break up was not super bad or anything like that it is just that i have a dependent personality and i am pretty sure that after almost 5 months of feeling like shit i probably suffering from depression will meet with a psychiatrist after finals are over
i finally made use of the help that is been offered to me the help that i get reminded to use whenever i mention to struggle
when she left i felt like a piece of me was being ripped out of me and it hurt a lot
so i am not sure how healthy this is i think it is oki will start it off around when i was in middle school
i once had a best friend a squad that i belonged to and it fell apart including me my best friend started to treat me like dog shit so i stopped talking to her which left me hear broken ever since
i know i am not the only one alone for christmas i know there is so much worse but i hope it is not like that for everyone
over the past year i have had a hard time with a lot of things i have not been motivated to do anything especially very important things like applying for internships or taking important exams
also my parents are forcing me to move to canada after i graduate so they can use me to get visa
so me and my ex broke up 1 month before i left for navy boot camp we broke up because she could not handle the distance and lack of communication that comes with being in the military it is not just that she went to college out of state so we pretty much do not get to see each other even if i did not join
this morning i got myself up i made myself pancakes and coffee and i headed to the gym and worked on myself
when we both moved back into our apartments things were okay at first we were excited to be back together and away from our families lol
i do have days where i feel slightly better like i feel i will be alright that i will make it through this
but i do not want to just sit by while everyone i love is out living and loving and being loved i am here
i was talking to a close friend that it sucks so much because i feel lonely and have struggled in making friends because of my sheltered upbringing and culture shock
i mean look at her now sustaining a long distance relationship for a year in which they have lived together not for weeks on end but several months on end
i am sure this type of post is made plenty in this sub but here i am sitting in my old room in the middle of nowhere for the few days a year i come back to my hometown finding myself unhappy about so many different things how do you get over this
one night i went over to a friends house she got upset since she was under the impression that i had made plans with her that day
but all the funding paperwork needed was so overwhelming we never were able to file for her visa the time expired so that kind of ended
but i used to make him happy a long time ago i just do not know what changed i do not know who that person was or where he went but god damn it i want him back
first of all i want to clarify that english is not my mother thong what i know about it i learned myself so my deepest apologies for the errors
thanks for reading if you did i do not really feel better after writing all that but yeah sorry if i did not post the right way or something
i did not cry for more than 5 minutes tho it was really shorti pray to god for you to be happy
it is weird to say and cliche in a way but alcohol has been the only friend i could rely on the past two years or so i have tried to get better and quit drinking even being in rehab three months or so ago but again it seemed in vain noone would acknowledge me for trying my best
i want to treasure him and love him properly so what should i do now i wish i felt whole i wish i did not know as much as i did
eventually i saw her in the hallway at some point but despite calling out to her and trying to get her attention she actively ignored and avoided me
making this post is a bit difficult to me and i am afraid it may sound a bit like a journal entry but here goes
my mental health has plummeted and my friends have been doing their best to help me where possible but i can not help but feel bad about it idk why i have very clearly told them that if i cross a boundary or anything that they can tell me to shut up or smth and i will and all of that sorta stuff but i still feel bad and idk why and idk whether i am just overthinking it or what but i just feel so fucking annoying and frustrating and i am paranoid that i am being toxic or smth idk
he does not know what to do because i have told him there is no point bothering because my mind is just going to fire back whatever he tries to help with even though it might help
when we broke up i was a mess for the first two weeks gradually getting better as time went on and only a mess after every three days or so and then after that i have been fine i usually started missing him when i was sad about other things as he was always the person i vented to and tried to get comfort from
i have hope that i am going to get a job and save money to go far away from here and form an ordinary life
they have been the clearest on what life means and what is important and what i can best do to improve myself
your laptop does not define your identity if you need a laptop to define your identity you do not have an identity
i do not want to die but i feel forced to kill myself so i stop hurting others i can not look for help myself i can not afford it
she read my name and said seeing the marks i had obtained he has done quite well who is it i stood up and said it is mine
so after that i did not really ask him to get back with me i mean obviously i can notsoi never really hear about the pain that is involved in suicidei reallyreallyreally tried to continue living in life
i was with a guy that every time he did not know something he would google it he does that all the time
she betrayed me with the guy she always told me not to worry about since she first told me about him
she does not want to be friends with me i put too much into our friendship i put more in than she does
those cycles i would say were accurate as swiss watches one mood per day but at least i knew was going to happen
whenever something new things like for example taking boarding pass out of kiosk machine or using pass book machine i mess up agian and agian so much that i avoid going to new places because it has new things my little brain can not comprehend
now i know these things happen no big deal but the problem is that i lived that situation of denial for so long i really can not picture a different relationship in the future
i have been looking to move to another country because i figure maybe a dramatic change is what is needed to not feel so alone anymore maybe i would find where i belong if i left my home honestly every night when i go to sleep i pray i will not wake up every morning that i wake up i am disappointed to still be here
i find at times thinking if we are the crazy ones not having travelled and taking everything too seriously i feel like i have compromised my mental health for the sake of nothing
i will probably end up making a new snapchat and changing my number as well since ultimately i never really want to hear him say he misses me because i know it will not be true
decided that she was not in the right space for a relationship even though the last 2 years was amazing do not really know how to cope with it tbh
i messaged him saying that i felt he was being distant and wanted some reassurance he did not do that instead he changed the subject
the best friend i always talk to about everything now i feel like i do not have anyone anymore this analogy always creates a sort of confuzzle inside of me
a planck time is approximately 5391 1613 1044 seconds it is the shortest theoretically measurable span of time my life hit bottom here
i have been through an awful breakup earlier in the year and i simply want to offer my support to anyone in lockdown or otherwise that needs some help male or female feel free to reach out
on the other hand reading and listening about stoicism as this art of lonelyness and emotional rationality has helped me towards slowly realizing stuff about myself and it has grounded me and put me in peace
5 months since i f20 broke up with my boyfriendm20 we were only together for like 3 months so nothing too crazy
my best friends did not think it our breakup would stick that we would somehow find a way to be together but we are not
they are mad at me they yell at me for being upset about it i just want to hang myself can someone help me hang myself
my parents broke up they are not divorced but they live in different houses they just act like friends now but really they barely see eachother
i am making money now on my own time and going to save up and move somewhere beautifulthis is the first day i can say i have accepted myself again
last year i started a new job for which i am studying and taking exams it was going really well my boss and i clicked instantly and we became very close friends
at 20 i moved out by my self due to my parents wanting to move 2000kms away where they grew upso i had to make the decision to stay or move and i chose to stay due to my career
i relapsed but i got an acceptance mail from a wellknown university i would love to talk and help out i know how miserable this can be
why should i some say friends what friends the ones i share a few messages with every now and then some say family
when i am not depressed my obsessions horrible thoughts that i did something wrong or that i will be punished for something i did not do fill the void i have absolutely no idea how to right this sinking ship i am trying counseling and my 5th medicine but nothing is working
and because i realised this i just want to end it all yes i should not say that but i just do more harm than good
all the chats and games and jokes that me and my class cracked it never hit me that i will not remember anything of this and all of us will head our own ways
what can i do to rid this feeling what can i do to stop being lonely when i do not have anyone some days i think my life will end with no one around to care
because i do not tell anybody how i feel and it just boils over into a giant pool of emotionsmy friend i can say boyfriend is facing some psychological problems these days
if nothing else i would like to at least tell my friends and family keeping this my lifelong secret has been a major part of the pain
avoiding work social or school activities for fear of criticism or rejection it may feel as if you are frequently unwelcome in social situations even when that is not the case this is because people with avoidant personality disorder have a low threshold for criticism and often imagine themselves to be inferior to others
what really pushes me everyday is knowing that life does not stop it keeps going and you got to pick up the wind whether you can or can not
the one that would be next to you when you grieve and wipe your tears for you and bring you joy for a cure
two days later a former teacher of mine back home killer himself too then a week after that a family friend who was practically my second dad died of alcoholism
i just want to tell him that none of this is his fault the last thing i would want is for him to blame himself for any part of it
he has almost broken down the bedroom door when i locked myself in during an argument to try and calm down
after that he called and said he loved me we started dating again and a few weeks later he said hey you know i want to move somewhere with a better climate
then when i brought it up in conversation she let me know that she felt weird when i asked to make it official
to help others cultivate happiness one must master the art of happiness for self you can only give what you have
btw no i have never been in a relationship and this would of been my first one if she said yes
she approached me and told me how she did not appreciate being asked to prom to be used for sex i stood there with my mouth open and let her walk away unsure of what just happened
i am so lonely and i think i will be forever alone i crave sex cuddling kissing and all that sensual stuff that i have never had i used to masturbate but it made my self esteem even worse i always imagine having a boyfriend that listens to my problems and i always make fantasies in my head that is no where near to the reality like having a father figure like having an honest lover
i breakdown from knowing that i cannot control these thoughts and i can not stop son i feel completely powerless because of them
long sorry short she said she is in love with him they talk every day for hours for months now and if things go well they will get together after covid
then his friends friendsgiving party comes up at day 32 and his best friend and her husband are supposed to come and they do not care for me because of my past
because i am not shit just does not feel the same anymore did not want to post on my usual account because people know me on that one
well first time was a mistake the second time is a fucking choice now he is gone and i am finally proud to say that i put a point to this crazy situation
i just feel like shit because we were so close to meeting only 3 months away he had also been bullied growing up differently
projection type thing like ok i am fine with you doing a sort of hoping i will not do it and as soon as i start doing a she immediately throws a passiveagressive objection against it
i know it sounds crazy but i really do not feel any more motivated even when i am feeling happy i just return to the same depression again it keeps hurting me over and over again
just never thought someone elsezn esp an ex would hate me that much it is as if i was getting the message no nope
i hate the body and skin i am in the thought of food has made me throw up on many occasions
i will not hear his voice in my ear at night i will not spend hours playing video games with him

but i have gone through my college life and i am going to leave with minimal friendships to carry past it and fewer still that are fulfilling and truly emotionally connected
the trouble with psychoanalytic ideas as it now appears to many is that they constitute a form of retreat from and therefore conformity to the real world psychoanalytic treatment does not challenge society it returns us to the world only a little better able to bear it and without hope norman of brown
i try to do good but i do not know anything so i just screw up or even if i do something good nobody notices and calls me a bad person
i even made a new reddit account so that she can not see this we follow each other on everything and it is really difficult for me to go on social media now and when i do go on there is no one stopping me from checking her accounts
he wanted me to leave it for her to find he was mad at me because i did not do what he told me to and cleaned the pot
i have been trying so hard every time i have been working for days for months everyday all the time no matter what i do or how hard i try even if i give all myself to it in the end everything always shatters
tech graduate with no friends and looking for a job and also for someone to talk to i can not tell if i feel like such a loser or if my anxiety has finally just snapped me
the night i started having tics was while i was playing overwatch with him and i did not want to leave because playing overwatch with him is when i am most happy
i love her i really do but to see her will just remind me of so many things and those things will f up me even more
i rather do that later in life or on offtime not a everyday which i suspect he does because he has a server and i am 100 sure he talks to them everyday and since i am the real life friend i do not bother him there
i live in a small town so there is not much to do or people to hangout with i have never really been the type to have lots of friends anyways
not scared for me but for my family who would have to go through the pain of my death if i did it
anyway for some reason this fucked with me or maybe it did not but it is the earliest i can remember feeling like i do now
i am now at a point in my life where i can no longer be considered as a dependent under my fathers health insurance plan
i just hate myself for being so stupid during my teenage years i just want to reset my life and change the mistakes that would not make me depressed
i am not diagnosed with anything i have never seen a doctor concerning my mental health at ages 1518 i was frequently abusing drugs and got arrested and sobered up i smoke weed and barely drink
i fuckef up the one chance i had yo be better this summer i did not even know whether or not i would be alive now and floated through fall when i could have been applying to colleges and for scholarships and aid and now that i have someone tryinf to help me or that ot looked like i might have actually had a chance had i started sooner its too late
most of the time i feel like i am being cut open and my rib cage is splayed like i am put on display like a a bearskin rug but it does not feel scary no it feels it feels warm and welcoming like a mother hugging her child
i look at all the hate going on in the world brothers against brothers sisters against sisters and family against family
i always care for him when he struggles with his mental health and he broke up with me over something so foolish he did not even give me an ultimatum or 24hrs to explain why i was not calling him as much
well let me tell you something you dumb fuck when everything i am told since i was born is that i can still improve i start to feel that i never progress at all
and i want to solve that problem not agonize or cry about it it is just that it is a very fucking hard tricky elusive absurd ridiculous extremely difficult to even approach kind of a problem for me to solve it feels extremely depressing and hopeless to me often and it does not help that i have to keep battling and figuring my way out of that repeatedly too
it makes it so hard for me to do anything i can not have a job or even to to school without endless pain
i explained what i meant she went into some kind of stupor thennow i look back found i really put all myself in our relationship
i gave her my happiness for her sake and now it is gone i hope someone can help me out maybe live chat with me on discord
last night was the first time i actually broke down in tears since the breakup has happened we would help each other in class and then have lunch together we would even exchange phone numbers
i know that sounds dramatic i think i am being dramatic but i can not stop it she thought we would eventually marry and get kids
meds do not work like they used to and the worst part is i have distanced myself with my mom who i have always been close to and i have nothing to do with my brother
her mother has schizoeffective disorder along with many other mental illnesses she opens up and is very welcoming to hear your stories
then sometimes when they can not hear me because of the masks i go to repeat myself and i stutter about half the time and the other half i stare back then repeat myself while they make eye contact and i do not know how to handle that
i am a 21 year old female from austin texas who is constantly disappointed and disgusted with my life i do not have any friends have not in years can not get a boyfriend for the life of me do not know how to make solid connections with ppl to make any type of relationship i am starting to think i have a nondesirable personality can any one give me tips on how to fix this
music helps me through everything in life and so i looked to music to help me through my breakup with my love of seven years
four months forward i went to check on her i did not even know if she found someone for real or it was a lie
i feel so selfish for how i feel though and i do not know how much longer i can keep feeling like my world is ending
1 how much time should i keep the no contact until i decide to return and try to be just friends i feel like i should be fine in 2 weeks how soon would too soon be to return
but i am 30 and being that person has never gotten me anywhere and i always hear the whole ohh you think because you are nice to girls that they should instantly want you you are not good enough flat out shit all the time
i had a roommate who abused her boyfriend and at times me for the silliest reasons waking up and not liking the look of my face are just one of many reasons and she would blame her severe adhd and manic depression to get what she wants if it is not her way it is no way
she forces our parents to abide by a byzantine series of cleaning and hygeine protocols and basically will not let them do anything outside the house she can have a seemingly normal conversation one moment then blow up on someone for seemingly nothing and seeth about it for the rest of the day
hey everyone i am new to reddit and i would like to apologise in advance because i know that this post might sound like i am very entitled and i am aware that there are many people out there who are doing way worse than me but i just do not like the state of my mentality at the moment and would like to just rant it out and take the weight off my shoulders
he ended up texting some old friends who he told me he had no interest in talking to i do not know why nothing is working there seems to be no hope at all
i am 42 alone and realized all of our friends are hers she was the outgoing bubbly one everyone likes her are there any people around edmonton alberta i would like to have people in my life
i still find myself regretting it now because since i did that all that is happened is my mind concocting more ways to die
she started to get very sick and eventually she died ever since she died its like i still see her and hear her barking
i know what you are thinking my ed is probably a result of my depressioni made it to my birthday this year has been tough for everyone
i had these expectations because of these fantasies and when i do not hear what i want to hear or do things i want to do i get upset
i am a social butterfly at heart i regularly go to events and have friends of plenty but my ghost ignores such gifts it insists i give it my undivided attention even in the middle of a glorious party my loneliness is loud and clear to me perhaps this ghost is selfinduced am i cursed or am i just pathetic either way i make serious attempts to smile and find pleasure in my life
i can not handle this anymore you broke up with me i do not play guitar i feel like my heart has been torn out and is 1000 miles away
will no contact even help this should i just move on and accept what he said to be true do you think he will calm down and talk to me eventually if i do no contact or did i ruin things forever
i have nothing left to give and it is getting harder and harder to pretend like i am doing okay i want to die but i can not
but actually being close to anybody no it had nothing to do with it all these people already had their basket of bonding needs and wants and desires and dreams filled
i want to go out and meet people too but its hard with the pandemic it only leaves me feeling more alone and scared than ever
i want to start the new year off with the way i want things to go from here on out and i want to ask you one question
classmates would make fun of me for being poor when i was not we get on like we are brothers we can literally talk about anything for hours
sit tight it is going to be a long story we met in october 2019 but that was to give me my lost watch he found it
i asked her what is going on but she said that she does not know she said she feels scared whenever she has that feeling and admitting she shuts down whenever she feels that
i am frustrated that i can not find a constructive way of expression i write them down but what is the use the glass is full and the water is overwhelming
lurker here 1st time poster hopefully the only time hahasorry if it is too long and if my grammar and format is bad
eventually i will find someone else who will appreciate all of the love that i have to give eventually that will happen
i am about to go home and go to sleep but it was really difficult i did not want to cry in front of him
i was childish and dramatic and now feel extremely embarrassed and i cringe looking back i regret a lot but i know that it has helped me grow
the only guy i have ever loved manipulated the hell out of me and left me w nothing but a hard drug addiction and an inability to trust anyone
me and my mother could not find a place we could call home for many years until i was in my teen ages
how do you deal with losing what you thought was your future how does that even make sense i can not accept that we are over and it is been a week and i just want him back
i decided to reach out to few people on facebook i knew my chances were slim as i have no real friends and a lot of peoole i know are selfish and selfabsorbed
life is just super boring and please do not tell me i can make it exciting and worthwhile i am tired of everyone telling me you will meet the one and life is so much fun
every day is just the same nothing i say to my therapist comes with insight but everything comes with the expectation of improvement
i feel like i am going crazy it is been about a month since my girlfriend of two years broke up with me
she asked for nc to process things and told me she would reach out when she is ready to be friends again because she does not want to lose me
first thing i noticed was the pressure my face felt like it was pulsing and expanding like i could feel myself turning red
i know i can never make up for lost time but i do not know how to avoid feeling like my chest will collapse when i think of it all
and the same force that keeps us dying every millisecond is going to at some point swallow us whole as well as all that we have created and everyone we knew
and now i am stuck here in the same house with the same people my mom will pay for my whole life out of guilt but she is going to die one day and i will be fucked
i am just an avoidant fuck up who drains life from everyone around me makes everyone is life harder for having to deal with me
sorry that this is all over the place i have been through breakups but i have never felt my heart shatter into a million pieces i have never felt such heart ache in my entire life i am still processing everything so thank you for reading this
my other best friend got into a new relationship and is always busy i feel like i have to schedule an appointment with her sometimes
i think i have bpd but i do not even fucking know because i never open up to anyone because i can not allow myself no matter how hard i try
3 like me just think suicidal thoughts maybe even do one of them i can not even watch movies everything gives me intrusive thoughts
we have gone nc but i still dream of her calling me up one day telling me she made a huge mistake that she wants me back
i spend my days in my bed starving and wanting to go the toilet but i just can not find any reason to get up and get breakfast as afterwards it will just be a void again
i have learned i do not need a relationship to feel loved do not get me wrong it takes time do not except to immediately feel better let yourself heal
i have been talking to two different people recentlyi asked for favors and god gave me opportunities i received nothing i wanted i received everything i needed
i started going to the gym and therapy i found someone who really loved me and made sure i was always okay
i just hope you realize your worth you make people better all the time inspiring them to be the best versions of their self
i want peace i want company i do not want to be alone i want to feel too like i have a family for which i have none whom i can trust and i am estranged i want a man whom i could connect with where friendship and relationship are both one as i would treat it
i had to hack his account just to discover this i know it is wrong bc it is an invasion of his privacy but i felt so cold and betrayed when i saw their conversation and how long their call logs was
maybe it is easier to play the victim than to have to deal with the hard truth that after all maybe you were not all that good to me
when i was out some of the time i could hear what was going on and feel myself falling but i could not speak or move and would go fully unconscious for what i think is only a short period of time
and now i can finally choose myself and end it the world is so cold and dark and i am anxious all the time
i have been trying to be better and have been working on my self discipline but when i am this miserable i do not know how to take care of myself
is it wrong am i a dick for that i am not a fuck boy or anything close my ex was my first ever real love rlts
i need mental support i am going to try my best i know i am still very young but i truly love him he is like a male version of me and i never got along with someone like him before i talk about him to my friends and families everyday because that is how amazing he is please give me any advice for breakup talk if there is someone who have experienced the similar situation
i do not even hate the fact that he yelled in my face and made fun of my suicide i do not regret going to a mental hospital and getting help
i do not know what is wrong with me but i just been struggling so much with my insecurities lately i never feel good enough and i always am scared of rejection i have really bad anxiety and my chest is very tight right now i constantly feel like i am going to cry and i can not pin point why i am so sad do not get me wrong i still laugh and feel happiness but that can switch quickly
i feel they think if not work just go for next one instead of going through everything together do you think my bf will regret some day or no
i tied a back around my head and i took it off after a few minutes because it was taking to long
because if he truly does not want to be with anyone he is not moving on to someone else he just shuts out everyone
they made a plot to ruin his life and sent anti corruption squad to raid our home they could not find any illegal assets but now everything we have ever owned is seized
she never wanted to have sex but she would be mad if i took care of myself so why can not he know i told him yes we are
i do not think i care to i do not think i care to live on much longer if i can not escape my thoughts
i was put through xrays and turns out i broke both my feet i was put back into my unit this time with a wheel chair
no matter how you are feeling or what is going on in your life if you can share any gifts share your smile instead that is good enough for me
we never met we talked from tinder for months because of the pandemic i ended up applying for a visa to visit us from australia in march next year
i sincerely doubt i will get swamped with requests but if so i will do my best to get it out before 2021
i am tired of this shit its not just one person or group of people either its most of the people i have been friends with none of these people every truly gave a shit about me
i know how virginity can be important to people it certainly was important to me so i made sure he was perfectly clear on my sexual history
for some reason during conversations the more i talked the more intense this feeling got until at one point i would either start slurring my sentences completely or just stop talking involuntarily
if heaven is not real i am suing that god ass mother fucker dead assi have tried a few months ago i ended up taking around 14g of modified release paracetamol
but this is not helping that much maybe cuz the time i spent with her was so good but she ended it in a snap and refused to talk to me or tell me anything about it
who is it i stood up and said it is mine and the question she asked me was what gave me the epiphany
also whether this was anxiety from me or me smoking weed a couple weeks ago a gas burner was leaking gas and not actually lit and i tried anticipating the likelihood of it exploding which sounds like gad to me
i do not have any friends because i am too anxious to go out make friends and better myself because i am depressed because i do not have any friends because i am too anxious to go out
i am 24m i am an introverted but nice personi should have believed when you said you are not worthy of love because in the end you were not
he does not want to have sex with me no plans for future with me i wanted to have a child and married
also recently i find sense of life that i never hear before from anyone around me our brain want dophamine and make it in cosmical doses
hi so idk if anyone else gets this but i had a full mental breakdown yesterday in front of my family and i have spoken about it and i am feeling better that it is out and i feel better it is off my chest
repeated failures of greatly motivated attempts involving great effort and work input to fix that scenario check i have been avoiding people now i think i might embrace them
i avoid people now i am too scared to even make friends at this point with anyone because i feel i can never trust anyone ever again
i still remember when mother told me that my self harm scars on my arms were disgusting and to cut somewhere else where nobody can see
while i laid there to cold cardiac machines trying to translate the sound of a broken heart i got to experience the repressed emotions clogging my arteries
going out anywhere is just one big anxiety episode i have tried medications therapy still am doing it to no real avail
i already fed up with a hole year of mental abuse from her and her bf i wanted to tone her out as i took her clothes out and put mine back in i started singing end of the world a jojo opening and she thought i was talking shit to her
but do they apply for our discordfriend group interactions also what are the chances of him coming back and how should i go about it
i would just like to say that i do not want to self diagnose i would just like to find a way to feel better there is no way i can receive professional diagnosis since i am not able to see a doctor
i was in a constant state of panic and depression because i felt like i had no choice but to be with him or lose myself
they always say they love me and they want to help and i recognize that but it is just impossible for me to feel happy mentioning my feelings
i have been wishing for a home ever since my dad died and i always figured my home would be with you
i tried to survive the last things i pushed myself and held on when i did not want to and now i am at a point where i can not be fucked anymore but i am not strong enough to die until one more thing happens to push me over the edge so i do not have time to think
things got strained when i lost faith in god revelation afterlife or anything supernatural ie separate from the material reality now i am a marxist very sincerely and politely declare my beliefs and accept theirs but that is not acceptable to them
what is the fucking point of fucking anything whatsoever if i remain desolately trapped in whatever it is that is causing me to fail to have any real love any experiences any romance any dating at least even any experiences even every now and then to stay stuck and unable to establish any genuine connections any real relationships to have any genuine bonds with anybody
hey people thanks for reading my ramble these things help me get my cluttered mind freeish i hope everyone finds their happiness and their peace take call all
most ironic thing is that he does not believe in godi am just shocked and if anyone else was to know they would think they were talking about someone completely different
i have noticed that whenever someone i know gets angry or sad i instantly get very anxious and wonder are they going to hurt or kill themselves these thoughts have always turned out to be inaccurate and i find that the people around me do not share them but does anyone else here think the same way sometimes and is it normal thank you
i was in the gym before and i started bawling my eyes out i had to leave before it got too noticeable
an injury i have had for years everytime despite my grievances i was told i was perfectly healthy and to go about my business
that night we later had an argument about how i did not trust him because i was paying attention to his following count and did not ask him straight up up why was back on instagram
trust me stop watching all kind of these videos like this they will make you feel better in a short time but for a long term they will kill you from the inside listen to me my friends false hope is not good in this situation you need to wake up and accept your relationship is over i know it is hard for you now but you must
this hurt way to much more than i though it will i did it for you and for the ones we where
i feel i am being pushed away from life here but at the same time i have a good job at a good firm and i am taking exams building a career here
i know she did not mean to make me feel bad by saying my advices are useless and that she does not need me it is just the fact that she needs warmth of another person just like i did few years ago
at an excursion with my class in third grade i was told point blank by a girl that since i was the ugliest boy in my class i should be paired up with the ugliest girl i can not remember the activity we were going to do but it was some game or another
anyway i escape into a world of my own a world where i am not a pathetic teenager asking strangers on the internet for help no instead i am a hero who can accomplish anything i want a person who is always happy basically my ideal self
i do not want to die i do not want to because myself any harm but if something were to happen if someone were to harm me or danger comes my way all i can do is shut down because i have no will to fight back
i bought a piano in junewhat did i do to be lonely my entire lifewhat did i do to be hated by everyone
you have decided your life is better without me in it and i have to accept that you have no anger or ill towards me
and as soon as i saw that it is like i went back to square oneis this too much to ask i just want love from them and them to be real
then comes wednesday december 2nd 2020 she packed up laundry and was super excited to leave the house i think what people consider averagelooking women are still stunning
his family is very rich and i was just a girl he liked to talk to whenever he wanted to brag about himself
would you like to be part of this project be part of the conversationif you want to be part of the visual storypublication
i hate that i was subjected to hell and that they probably got off in some sense at seeing my cry
the heat lately has made me feel even more drained it is hot in australia lately and i do not do well with even mildly hot temperatures which does not help with everything i do not feel stressed but at the same time i can not keep up with everything that is happening
she never gave me an answer not a no not a yes just silencei have always been alone i did not have a friend to talk to before
her living her best life involves cutting me out of it and it kills me inside i keep thinking of the what ifs
i was really bitter about this when a guy from the accommodation started showing me attention i started texting and meeting him in secret
the first year was formative and wonderful but afterwards it was like the honeymoon was over but it was not until recently that i received several complaints about my work performance i had gotten too comfortable
one night i got so upset and i was literally bout to break up wit her for no reason something told me to break up with her because i had a feeling her and that boy was going to turn out to be more than friends soon but i just took myself to bed and woke up feeling better we talked and had a good day and then we spoke on the phone at night and i introduced her to my mom since we been dating for 4 months
i am texting this in hopes that somehow someone on here can help me make no mistake this is a cry for help

we were together for 7 years last year he cheated on me and begged me to stay after i found out
he was the only person who cared to contact me now i am aloneno one textphone me i feel like a shadow in this world
i bet they purposely keep me out of the loop he does not tell me anything what am i supposed to do i feel that he purposely keeps himself unavailable to me like constantly playing video games or watching tv he will not let me interrupt him is this crazy
in terms of my interests i thoroughly enjoy reading books on philosophy history and economics as well as nonfiction and detective fiction
when a car or a metro passes in front of me i want to jump in front of it so bad
admittedly not my finest moment which she said she did not know so i asked if she could at least give examples
we both helped each other not feel empty anymore and learn how to express feelings and emotions and for once feel happy
does anyone else feel like they do way better in one to one interactions as compared to group interactions for mei feel like my reason for this is because i really fear judgement when speaking to a group whereas if i am communicating one to onei get to truely bond with the other person and i am less likely to be judged
i can just sum this about about him me and him are really different but i felt that was good because opposites attract right all he does really is sit online all day you know 4chanredditrule 34etc
i know it will probably get better they will probably come back or i will find someone else but fuck the pain just will not seem to leave this time around
we chatted on facetime todayshe reached out to me by texting on snapchat because she felt like she needed more closure and a couple of answers facetiming today has broken me and has me really upset as i am so confused i made a list of things that are positive about her and things that are negative and the positive outweighed the negative so so much
now you know what is going on in my head but do not think that it is over yeti have one last request one last advice you should always keep in mind
i realized my interests are really too obscure no one my age is into what i am into and i am just so damn socially awkward i always do the awkward thing and then the next day reprimand myself for being so awkward
so do girls ever regret breaking up with a guy or do they only need reassurance that they can get them back with a snap of their fingers she also says that i make her feel safe and cared for but she no longer returns those same feelings to me
i should not be like this i hate myself not blaming him cuz i said that quite often the desire to claim death seems to get stronger
you become so out of control you eventually just give up and just accept that that is your life now in situations like that
i know perhaps i need to feel this for as long as it is there and perhaps in some small way it will always be there and perhaps that is where we can find the beauty of being alive hopefully i will always remember just how happy i once felt because of just how unhappy i feel now and hopefully one day i will learn to treasure both sides of the coin
she and i had talked previously about these issues i have had numerous times we both went to therapy and we set up boundaries so that our relationship could work
yes i was still anxious as a kid but i did not have the deep sadness and apathy and feelings of worthlessness that i do now
that is about it i just do not feel like going anymore but i know if i die right now the groupchat would probably be sad andor mad at me for it if they end up hearing about it
i was never allowed to take therapy as a teen because my parents did not want me coming out i feel so fucking numb to other peoples problems and my memory is fucked
with psychosis depression anxiety fatty liver and schizophrenia i have two addictions that i had for the majoritymost of my life i have called the suicidal prevention hotline and texted the crisis text line dozens of times i had bad mental health for over two years i do not know what to do
my dark moments are interlaced with more rational moments of lucidity but how often can i keep that switch going i do not want to be here
how to be alone is a short film that portrays a girl who is alone and bored and must inevitably battle multiple anxieties and fears within her mind it makes you feel less alone just watching it i would recommend this to anyone who struggles with involuntary alone timelonelinessdepression especially during quarantine you can register find the short film on argo with this link httpswatchargocomhttpswatchargocom
i have a great relationship with my family and we all love each other so much but i think i am the only single person out of my siblings
my hopes are if i can push myself into self improvement in these hard times the habits will stick then when this pain is over i will look forward to coming home to my family and washing my face and writing in my journal after work this is all so later i can use these as stress relief
i tried a lot of breakup solutions that i read about but they never worked i always pictured my ex as a perfect being
i do not know if she read my message but i think she did i did not mean any of it i have trust issues with those things i do not trust them
i do not even know where to start with this as it is the first time i have ever discussed things i struggle with
can you please give me advice concerning my casei met him on my 1st session of my classthis is really venting i will try to keep it as simple as possible
i am going to give a backstory so you can understand me better i am 17 btw sit tight it is going to be a long story
my reasoning for not wanting to go to the hospital was simple i did not want to be in the hospital for christmas and i still had waaaaay too many christmas gifts to wrap
they say it is good to talk to someone whose suicidal but when rubber hits road you feel like you get shunned for feeling that way
i do not plan on telling anyone irl i messaged my friends on groupme about an hour ago telling them that i am feeling depressed and i almost did not send it because christmas there is no way i want to ruin everyone is christmas by telling them that i strangled myself i might tell them in january or maybe not
saying that i should just give up and follow them working some random dull office job with them it being the best way to go in life and is the truth to happiness
she would be there for me day and night even while i am working she was always there when i was sad stressed or angry
i keep looking for ways to make this work but i can not do it all myself if you do truly want me back i hope you are doing your part to care for yourself and your future i miss you i love you i want to try again but i will not if you do not do your part too
will try to keep this as short as possiblewell i do not want to run anymore marathons i do not want to fucking exist anymore
my mother deserves a normal daughter and she is been through so much so i can not end up in a ward because i flipped out because then she will have to have psychotic daughter on her conscience
i cannot control my eating well because it makes my mental health worse again and i am moving a lot but not enough to create a significant enough calorie deficit
they will typically try to scratch their psychological itch by saying things that push people closer to the edge they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above specifically you might see people doing the following
i know the holidays can feel hard right now but just remember each day past today you will be stronger you might feel lonely but you are not alone here everyone here is going through a time of repair and restoration to a better version of themselves
21 m i am just so tired and everything feels fucked up i sleep but way too long fucking no one gives a shit no one cares to even answer me
i love you more than anything in this world you can not change anything you might want them but you do not need them
i just do not want to hurt anyone but i know it will my close friends have severe depression and i do not want them to have to go through a death
i do not want to have a pity party i just want a straight up solid dude that i can chill with game with laugh with pick up girls with i dunno
besides health obsessions like that issues like academics because me a great deal of stress it is natural to be stressed about university applications grades the future and whatnot
i have tried asking my family for help with finding another therapist but they either ignore me or tell me i am crazy
and then people wonder why i act the way i do people wonder why i am so broken and reserved and shy even after years of therapy and meds and sinking myself into my hobbies and doing my best to stay strong and pretending to be happy for others sake i am just stupid and it is my fault and no one wants to hear it my abusers are left alone because my pain does not matter
i used to have heavy suicidal ideation it is a lot more moderate and nonserious now but never actually asked for help from anyone until i went to get my mental illness treated
i guess i am currently seeing a mental health counceller at my university with the excuse that i am not getting anything done in my courses
does anyone have any advice on how to get over this i am sorry if this text is confusingit is been almost a month since our breakup
i just lie in my bed listening to sad music and browsing social media feeds for hours nap and be drowsy all the god damn time
if i did leave i am afraid of what he would do he has locked himself in the bathroom with his gun in the past
then come the next weekend she says out of no where promise me that no matter what happens to us you will be okay which i answer back what ever it is we got this together but she asked me again and made me promise her
i just feel disassociated most of the time everything feels so unreal i want to talk to someone about it who can understand
i have tried sitting in my room just by myself but am finding myself becoming increasingly irritated with my family feeling like they are constantly bugging me asking to watch filmsmake cakes etc when i have already said i want to just sit watching films or tv by myself i go for a walk to the shops and back most days to get out of the house and to try and get some exercise
i get teary eyed whenever someone as much as hugs me i think i just miss my mom more than anything now
what are you all thoughts on arranged marriages or marriage contractsthe loneliness that i have been living through for the past 5 years is becoming unbearable
it is strange because i have never been so proactive trying to find a girl but at the same time i have never had such trouble succeeding
last night was the first time i actually broke down in tears since the breakup has happenedif you have a link to one can i please have it
actions speak louder than words they will be disinterested in you not message you say i am busy when you want to hangout and talk behind your back about how they want to stop being friends with you because your too depressing
i just want my child to be ok i just want her to be happy i want to kill myself and know that i will soon i just wish i could see into the future to know that she will be ok and happy and loved why is everything so difficult
they also helped me to refer myself to therapy online through the charity mind which i would not have done if i did not have the support
verbal abuse you make me stressed being ignored for hours gamesnetflix over me will not praise me or call me pretty calls me pathetic and useless you invalidate my feelings you make everything about you i am tired threats su1cideoverd0sing etc
i am actually envious of this quality of yours past relationships were toxic and of course failed online dating is not for me
my ex left me she told me her parents she liked and even after the break up it is evident that they still like me
how could he want me soo badly 3 weeks ago yet nothing i swear i know it is stupid but i think he is my twin flame
i felt only a little sad after i graduated high school when i found out a former high school teacher and coach had a heart attack then another died of cancer
so i have a history of depression and selfhatred once upon a time it was really really bad but i have grown a lot since then and i feel like i have gotten a pretty good handle on my mental health
in any case the first year of knowing him we were not talking or anything i had a ldr with another guy which ended after 9 months
because of love remember that is not an easy word to understandhaving someone to take care of you and always support you no matter what
before i can get a sentence out he yells if you want to commit suicide go outside later when mom asks why i am crying he says he did not do anything to me
i kind of knew what i was getting into though he told me at one point during the relationship that he was not over his ex but he also said he still wanted to be with me i just never knew how to feel about it at the time
also i know long distance relationships are not the ideal at all and i did not want ours to keep going forever like that at all of course
i will be meeting with a therapist next weekso i am having some very heavy suicidal thoughts and i am thinking about ending it all probably tomorrow
i am so scared and feel so betrayed he is moved on and stuck in this hole of despair with no bright spot on the horizon
i used to be creative a talented writer now when i try to do something creative it is pathetically derivative i used to write little parody news articles when i was 13
and then when someone reach out to me on the internet i talk to them a while but then my sick mind start to worry that i am not good enough they deserve someone cooler somehow ruins it and i do not know how to communicate through texts when it comes to men i have respect for them and i am kind of scared of them yk
we talk a couple days ago and we are both honest with each other both of us slept with someone else but because it was only anal i am the bad guy
my parents do not let me wear the clothes i want so every time i hear something about clothes i get ptsd from me and my parents fussing and fighting about my clothes
i am considering ending it but i am afraid i will fail w the method the reason is because i know things will not improve for me
he just got really mad and aggressive because i did not want to go for a walk with his dog meanwhile i repeatedly was saying that i was not feeling well he only realized i overdosed when he found me laying on his nasty bathroom floor sweating and shaking
for the past 5 years i have been dealing with a mental problem that has been ruining my life i have spent countless hours trying to find others who deal with the same thing but i have not found anything
frequently i either skip meals or do not take insulin because it feels like far too much of a challenge when its something i know i need to do
never have been she said she is busy what seems unrealistic to me and more like not giving a fuck about me
i had a lot of time to think about it and i came to the realization of how much i was missing my ex gf
our first time hanging out we went out on a long hike with some other friends after that me and her went on a bike ride together
i do talk to her and try to ask about her day when i get the chance to see her however i feel like i can do more
i was homeschooled and heavily isolated in a cult where i was horribly abused until i escaped recently you can dm me anytime you want and let us help out each other
this is nothing special i am simply lonely and i feel like talking to anyone about anything how do i make the emptiness go away any tips
i thought the space from me when i went to boot camp would give time for her to think thinks through if that what she really wanted
i am staying in town to work but i am finding it really hard to be alone especially with covid restrictions i have been working out facetiming people and doing my best but it is getting exhausting to keep this up
i am still young getting close to finishing high school but every day i just feel exhausted too tired to even do things i love like playing my favorite video games or talk to friends
this is literally my first post let me know if i am missing anything also i am not english naitive so there might be some grammar errors
after months of her leaving me and coming back and leaving and coming back i blocked her i finally blocked her
he is on every dating site and hook up site he will pay for sex he tries to hook up with girls in their 20s and 30s for money of course
so basically i have no friends and i have never felt like i belonged and still do i am going to give a backstory so you can understand me better i am 17 btw
i just feel like am i ever going to be happy am i over reacting because i want him to spend just a little bit of time and attention on me am i the one being selfish for thinking he is constantly being selfish and then he asks how he can help me feel better sometimes but still will refuse to move from his computer
now it feels as if none of that even happened like my grandma died years ago or something i feel like i should be sad still or should care more
funnily enough she never mentioned this other guy i do not even think she knows that i noticed her texting a lot with him
i need to stop checking because it is inhibiting my healing but i am sincerely struggling to let her goi am a uni student living alone and have no friends here
i can not meet his mom until i am x lbs since his ex wife was rail thin it took me months to get to 160
through the grace of god the universe the divine the higher power we are always being protected guided and supported everything in life takes time everything in life is moment by moment is minute by minute is hour by hour is day by day week by week month by month and so on
i hate myself and i want to just disappearhow long should you wait after a relationship to sleep with someone else
i am 25 and i have never been in a relationship i hate this about myself i believe i am a normal guy not a weirdo who creeps girls and make them run away i do not know what to do i am desperate for a meaningful connection
my hppd hallucinogen persisting perception disorder makes all of this worse too for context i abused cannabis and various psychedelics for many years before the permanent effects became apparent now on top of my preexisting conditions i have to deal with a thick layer of static over everything i see random dissociative spells and general confusion it makes my anxiety awful and my ptsd worse
you want to expose yourself to the cold to freeze recognise that you are going to have the thoughts but how can i change how i have the thoughts
i just really want to feel okay and i just can not i just cry myself to sleep every fucking night it is like i can be okay ish and stuff but then before i sleep it always comes back to me and i am just feelings all sad and weird and dead
i can not decide if it is easier or harder to know you changed your mind about forever with me you do not want me anymore todays been exceptionally hard
why do i never let myself date the guys i am truly attracted to the ones that are my type physically and personality wise
so long story short i m19 broke up with her 16 a month ago after that we tried to fix things but then she said that she did not want to continue doing it and i was trying really hard to fix it but it did not work
i know this sounds counterintuitive and too good to be true but try it and see that it worksin the grand scheme of things realize that we are all flawed beings but again that is fine you are fine
i thought i was smarter more gifted and more important than the average joe but never voiced an opinion my mood fluctuates throughout the day and changes at the drop of a hat
everything was awesome with us we both opened up to each other had a lot in common and a lot different and were going through similar things in life and it felt really good to have someone in my life like that and felt like a real friend and potential relationship and it was not one way
i do not know what to do about this i have always had intrusive thoughts but never this violent i have been getting really tired in my life because i work 6 days a week so i am losing my mind a bit i am having daydreams of me trying to kill my coworkers though and it makes me feel so horrible i would obviously never do this but i hate that my head is capable of this
i never pressured him to take me out on dates i was okay just making dinner for us and eating it at home
i have been pondering for the last week or so why i feel so down a huge part of it has to be grief my mom passed right about this time of year 13 years ago it was just so sudden she was my best friend and i miss her very much i knew that she loved me
i asked her if i am too clingy and if that smothered her she said no not really she just felt it that way
i have been suicidal almost 20 years now for my entire adolescence and adult life i have tried6 2 stays in a public psych ward due to suicidality
i can never share my true emotions around anyone no matter how much i want to because i have conditioned myself to not show them
but at the same time i think so what if they will like me only for my looks that is no deal
merry christmas to anyone that can manage to somehow enjoy it because my girlfriend broke up with me and she was my everything
i picked it up from my parents i was crying from leaving there i wanted to turn back and just tell them but what would they do i am a grown ass man why can not i deal with my problems myself but i can not i feel so scared like i am a kid again though maybe i still am emotionally
i do not have any friends and at work i typically keep to myself and will have the occasional casual encounter with people here and there but i have not realized how much this mattered to me
a few months into the relationship we kept breaking up then getting back together and fighting over the his the topic of his ex
i am asking because i am a little concerned that i might be a sociopath in disguise looking back at my past behavior
every evening is the same routine i eat dinner change into my sleeping clothes watch a few videos on youtube jack off and go to sleep the monotony is killing can not even get satisfaction from porn anymore because i am too tired
i just want to be skinny so i can look and dress the way i want to not for anyone else
it is been 8 months since then and we have had really high highs and extremely low lows i was toxic my confidant
no matter how many hints i give they just do not notice i do not blame them really i have let it go dozen of times and i am willing to do it again
i was not always the best son my 20 year old brother is locked up in missouri eastern state prison for the past 4 years since he was 16 for some terrible crimes which makes my life even harder
note i do not want to feel better i do not wish happiness i do not want to go back in time to the good ole days i do not need my friends to message me i do not want the respect back i do not want help i do not want my intelligence back
it is my birthday and it feels a bit like a test but it might be healthier to reframe today and the tests that come after
you were scared but you were honest after that you wrote me a note with i love you dummy on it
maybe i was going about this all in the wrong way but it does not matter i do not care anymore i am so sad i broke up with him and he is devastated and wants me back
i have done things i regret and things that are definitely not good but i know that already why does my mind force me to think of myself as some sort of bad person i feel like i am being judged by everyone i have ever known right now yet here i am just sitting in my bed at 300 am with nothing actually happening
i am not powerful enough whatever it is all the i am not enough all of that stuff that is bound to come up all of that is natural to come up
gives me chills yet makes me cry because it is no morebecause the one i love the most left me for other interests
like what the fuck do i have to do to make people care the truth is if i killed myself and it was on channel 1 news they still would not care
about 8 hours after i threw up 34 times and ended up nauseous and with a throbbing headache for a few days
i do not want to do it and yet sometimes it pops in my head with such nonchalance that it takes much longer than i would like in retrospect for it to kick in that what had just occurred to me was a bad thing to think
when she first started working at my job i had the biggest crush on her at the time she was not single so i thought nothing of her
but it is really really hard because my struggles obviously also affect those people that are close to me and understandably so but it just makes it really hard to continue to be open about your struggles so you can try to heal and improve when you feel like you are just pissing everyone off frustrating them upsetting them stressing them out
this was by far the last thing i wanted to hear but i knew she was drunk so i tried not to give it too much credit
but in my opinion it is very common especially in adulthood i hate hurting the one i love most especially the one that loved me enough to marry me
i have been severely depressed and suicidal my entire life i have never had a single friend and do not get along with anyone regardless it makes anyone i am around uncomfortable but i can not not be miserable no matter what yes i have tried therapy it is a burden to everyone and their days and so on so on
i am friendly i feel like there must be something wrong with me at this point in a space of 3 weeks with the same guy it was not sex but is that not significant
long story short since we started working together i accidentally saw his calendar shared with me where i noticed a lot of personal information including 23 callsdinners per week at 9 pm on fridays or weekends with girls does not look like a business calls for me
i already gave you chance after chance for years and you messed it up every time it is been 8 months since then and we have had really high highs and extremely low lows i was toxic
most days i think about it every moment to the point of headache my brain is trying to find a way out of an impossible situation
i do not like the idea of casual sex and i do not want us to be a friends with benefits that is it nothing more nothing less
i mean i am for those things but they should be making me happy i should not have had to force myself to look excited yesterday when i opened them but i did
it is christmaseverybody is happy with their family while me i am in my room fucking cryingjust thinking about everything going on with life
it was not quite the event i had expected it to be but it did make me realise how few friends i have
it is got to the point i have convinced myself everyone hates me and i am embarrassed to ask to meet people because i am so sure they will say no and think i am weird
as age 16 i was naive always been a good person student council leader even volunteered for fun i knew i had good intentions with everything coming in my life
one day i finally asked him very very gently if he could please talk to me instead should i tell him should i keep it to myself
i am so lost that i do not even know who i am and my pride is taken away by everything but still i am happy for people not going trough what i have to go trough i am not jealous
the connections i used to feel with my family feel diminished not because of anything they did but just because of me and my mind
all of my friends are still friends with themso before november i was in a really bad place really depressed suicidal and self harming a lot
and it kind of scares me because i am getting used to it i do not want anymore bullshits with other people anymore but then i want someone to listen to my shits too personally
so i texted his mum who i assume he is staying with that her son took my medications and i need them back and that i will have to report it
i have a circle of friends who i love n can count on but none of them are in the same situation n i was wondering if there was someone else out there who can relate to me right now maybe we can have a chat n idek help each other out a little bit
traumatic events i am tired of never being enough for myself i do not know how much longer i can take this
after we broke up my city went on lockdown not too long afterwards and we have been living together since different rooms obviously
i spent most of those 3 years working on myself and working out and just being a man who are and occasionally i would meet women who were more than just hookups but i quickly would become annoyed by certain habits they had that i just would not put up with in the long run
it is important to respect and understand peoples experiences and emotions it is never necessary helpful or kind to support suicidal intent there are some common misconceptions discussed below about suicidal people and how to help them that can because wellmeaning people to inadvertently incite suicide there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful
the above are just examples so do not forget to create some of your own thoughts too it feels like there is something separating me from the rest of society humankind whatever you want to call it
i am sorry for what i have done i do not think i would kill myself i have considered it but i know i am too scared
i hate that my mental health is so fragile that if i go one day without eating my gad flares up am i just hungry or is it actually the anxiety as a result of not eating
i feel that perhaps this is the kind of situation where one should check themselves into the hospital but the thought of being isolated and constantly monitored for several days is straight up terrifying and sickening on top of the worry of medical costs and not wanting to strain medical services further as they struggle in the current pandemic
no one seems to care at all i do not want to look anyone in the eye again anxiety an overview and ways to treat ithttpswwwredditcomrmindovermatterscottcommentsd63aglanxiety_an_overview_and_ways_to_treat_it
despite earning enough from my parttime job i will not be able to travel because i have no friends my parents will not let me go alone because they are strict
my dad could not come out i received two things a pair of underwear and a pair of socks and i know that might sound ungrateful but as a 16 year old kid that was already expecting a bad christmas it would have been nice to get something other than what i got
all i could think about was her and i wrote to her a lot and she wrote to me as well
do not give up do not give up on people do not give up on yourself after returning to school we started dating and it was like a dream come true
and i think i realize that i am no longer depressed but just very unhappy and i think i find it even worse
i need some advice on how to cheer up my sisterher boyfriend of 12 years broke up with her yesterday and she is devestated
yet it is my fault i work 60 hour weeks and do school full time and somehow run the kid everywhere she needs to go and oh my god i just can not anymore
lately with the pandemic i have been scammed of a good amount of money lost members of my family to the virus and my parents do not talk to each other the same way parents should
once i am able to get a gun i will most likely be gone i am so fucking empty and at this point nothing will change that besides temporary coping methods
what did i do to have pain because of love this thought leads me to what might have contributed to her negative behaviors in the relationship
i feel like the only reason i do not is because the people that know me would just shake their heads and act repulsed one last time
making 50k in my second year two years later 59k in the bank 61k invested zero debt very pleasing for a nineteen year old but at the same time all i do is work
i am a human two you know as a creative i want to make the invisible emotion visible through still life images and sound
wish they were not there i wish i did not have to be a burden on them my head will not shut the fuck up and my heart will not slow down
i just can not let go of him how to accept that i will have to live without him for the rest of my life
a little lazy odd and too honest and almost always very very alonei have read that loneliness can actually kill you
they do disappearing acts off facebook as well and only contact me when they want something i hate to leave like this but the pain is unbearable i can not take it anymore
i do not get any messages to get a bit happier my messenger is totally empty from that point she broke up with me before our anniversary dec 22
at the same time though even saying it hurts me i know deep down i am not even like this but for some reason i can not even explain i wish nothing but the worst for her i hope she puts her own heart on the line for a man who gets tired of her shit and cheats on her too so she fully understands what that felt like for me
it will be my last birthday i will be alone as per usual since no one has ever cared about my birthday but this will be my last year alone
i am a bit jaded tho when it comes to dealing with therapy with statesponsored healthcare in my experience such people get the very bottom of the barrel
many people do not understand how it feels and why i do this which actually makes them dislike me quite a bit i do not even understand why i do this can someone please she would some light on the situation and maybe help me give others a way to understand thank you
if you are prepared for situations that might give you anxiety i think it would at least reduce your feelings of anxiety
after 2 years in my heart i knew she was the one i wanted to spend my life with and i thought we were both on the same page
then she decided to post sexual images on her story and implied that she was going to start posting nudes after she told me that she would never do that and that she wanted to focus on her relationship with god
he was my first and my only love i have had in this life so far since the trip he is started to ignore me again
anyways i am sorry if this post is kind of messy i hope it makes sense if anyone has any advice on this or what could help i am willing to try almost anything to feel better and get through
thank you for your support the subreddit was created to provide a space for us to discuss how to best help our loved ones and keep our heads above water too ocd is a debilitating illness and although it is rare to cure completely it can be managed well with support care from loved ones medication and time
i do not know how to share my interests or thoughts with other people i do not know how to say even to myself that i am not doing well without feeling whiney
this sounds like a damn joke but it is true this honestly was so hilarious i went home but the fee will fuck me hard
i honestly feel nothing but anger because of the way he treated me and the fact he is not spending time working on himself but instead just hopping on to the next girl
two weeks ago today i caused a car crash which put five peoples lives in danger including myself two cars completely destroyed mine included
i am suffering from depression and loneliness for almost two years now after my expartner cheated on and dumped me i am kind of socially awkward and could not make meaningful connections with people since childhood
today when i said that i would wait for him and he told me i would only end up hurting my own feelings
as for me i hate waking up and i struggle to get out of the bed i have also got a fantastic family who looks out for me and some great friends however all i want to do is sleep my life away and that is my only wish which will make me happy
but i have not felt anything besides sadness and numbness in probably around 6 monthsa yearlike i either feel sad or i feel nothing
but this this is something i cannot explain other than i am crazy i have had extremely vivid dreams of my daughter four to be exact
instead i am cuddling with a shirt from a former love that i sprayed with a cologne he left behind praying he comes back
well you would probably fall into an existential crisis and start wondering all kinds of spiritual and bizarre questions like what is the point of living now you would begin to question everything you know everyone you know and even yourself and your deepest core values
no matter what you are going through there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and you will find the positive side of things
even if that means they might not be someone i care about or they might not be the best person to be around
sometimes i have soo bad trips and so bad money situation what i want to suicide hes not bonuses me with things like that i hear like hes question me are breathing yes do you have something to eat and drink yes what about clothes cigarettes yes i have it all so wtf more you need
i was so anxious all the time that i felt like throwing up every time i ate i also started experiencing some form of panic attacks my own diagnosis
i have been battling with depression panic disorder adhd and cptsd for years but just got formally diagnosed back in june after reaching my breaking point for what seemed like the millionth time while visiting my family in my hometown
the motive to send the letter was to acknowledge the areas i had erred to let him know that i had recognised my shortcoming allow myself a closure and to wrap things up it was a very selfserving act to keep my ego at bay
the clingyness started to get to me because after a full 5 day weekend together i felt i was ok going home and was kind of happy to get back to my bed but she was always gloomy about it and i left feeling guilty but at the same time glad i was going home
wishing you all a merry christmas and hopefully not a lonely one for anyonei work at this place with nice coworkers
i am lucky i had a good childhood overall but i remember so little of it so it feels like i did not know it was good while i had it
i was finally starting to feel okay these past three days putting more effort into my appearance for work not getting anxious as often
she was planning on doing it yesterday but i convinced her to wait until we see each other which will happen on her birthday in january
and in the end these selfproclaimed experts tell you how you need to use jealousy techniques or other forms of manipulation during your 30days no contact rule to reattract your ex
the other day i cried because i accidentally blew out the candle my brother wanted to blow out i have been having these useless cry sessions daily
literally stayed alive for the past fucking year for someone because i thought i would ruin them by committing suicide i have deprived myself for so long for nothing lmfao
as a status symbol a laptop is a dated item to latch onto when the most prominent gadget we have today is a smartphone
my little brother told us that he was getting bullied in schoolprimary school btw and he told us about an incident that happened 3 weeks ago and i feel sooo helpless and i do not know what to do i mean he said they apologised after but there are always these situations with my brother where he gets upset about these things and i do not know what to do
i know i am like one of the luckiest mofos you will ever meet so i can only imagine what trials and disservices people from similar situations as me have met
i do not want to be the person that i am but by the nature of the person that i am i can not be anything different
when she woke up she started to apologize and told me that she was over her ex and was not sure why she said that
i do not know what to do i feel i will never be happy i just really needed to write it down
i would really like to stop badgering my boyfriend about this and just be happy again but i do not know where to start
my grildfriend of 9 months and i broke up very recently we had a connection i have never experienced before but due to my awful selfconfidicne i hurt her adn she could not take it anymore three times she experienced that i called her a who are i never meant that never had such a thought never wanted to hurt her
i m18 went through my last breakup 56 months ago and i had a full mental breakdown and i can finally see girls as attractive again and actually want to be in a relationship
edit thank you for all the words and i am sorry you had to see this reddit is usually the only place i can express my feelings and i have been struggling for a long time i am doing a bit better right now it is just the past couple of years have been rough
this whole situation is starting to get to me i am fine and i feel terrible for complaining about it but i m getting tired of this cycle
we pulled up to the window and she told me to cancel the shake for a coffee instead i offered to buy her one no
i have been planning on killing myself for a while and i think i will do it soon i have no purpose no direction and i feel worthless
someone to be there to hold me close and talk to me sure i have my online friends but something still lacks
sometimes i want to go back to being lonely where no one knew anything other than the happy go lucky dude who played baseball because i internalized everything
my former best friend is battling with what seems to be mental illness and i can not take it anymore like is it actually mental illness and how do you support someone struggling with that when you want nothing to do with them anymore because they have treated you so poorly and been so selfish or is she just a shitty person making excuses for herself all the time
tried going to church and adding local ppl on fb but at the end of the day i am sitting here home alone
i have moved on and am doing alot bettertoday i have watched soul from pixardisney i know it was not much it is an animation usually intended for children
have hardly seen anybody this year apart from my parents whom i actually want to get away from i just want to be with someone and feel like someone cares and like me lost all my hope and dreams and trying to find a way in a cruel lonely world
nothing in this world makes any sense can not find a religion that suits me very few friends my political stance is closest to a sort of tribal monarchy with distributism i have memories things do not add up like i belonged somewhere else long ago another people and another history ceremonies and holidays i can not relate to anyone or anything here
after about 40 minutes or so my dad asked if i wanted to go home but it was christmas and i wanted to spend time with my grandparents they are 93 and 89 and i love them with all of my heart
i am so conditioned to tip toe around her and now unfortunately others i hate it anyway the acquittance was in blank so i had to filled it
i have gone through so many emotions in the past few days i want him to make it right but i do not know if he will ever be able to
i know nothing about my sexuality what i like or dislike if i am into guys or girls or both or neither
just need to hear some encouraging words or if anyone else is in the same boat as i feel really trapped in my head at the minute and i am finding it harder than ever to pick myself up
then they try to know about you for a very very short while not more than 10 days just to make sure you did not kill yourself not because they care about you or anything because they know how unfair they did you and want to feel like a better person by asking your friends about you so that your friends say
and my mom always supports him and tries to justify whatever he is doing i live with them and have no where to go as of now
i tried to break up with her which went okay at first but then she started talking about how i hurt her and she just wanted something healthy long story short i am still in a relationship
i know i will not do anything i just wanted to express what i am feeling i am only limited to high earning careers so i have no choice of becoming something else
because i know i am straight just the idea of me being together with another woman seems so i was surprised at how confident i had become
i hate how fucking stupid i am and this carries down to basically every single element in my life from my strained relationships with friends and family to my academics and my horrible skill at video games
it is been days since we have contacted and it was hard it the beginning but i have finally started to breath and let it go
i do not understand any of it i know this is very very wrong but i also do not know what to do about any of this i do not want to but now i feel hopeful
the reason i put quotations is that it was not technically a real relationship it was a longdistance relationship ill explain everything later
i carry this sense of hope with me but i do not want hope anymore i wanted the certainty of her feelings and emotions to me and i did get that in the sense that she decided to leave me and just wanted to be friends i do not want to be an option to someone i love when they are my priority
when i told my sister about my thoughts she said it is a phase she went through the same and said it would go away
i do not want to do that to others but on the other hand i do not think i can endure this torture for them either
but i feel as if the girls at my school are not the ones for me i hate the saying plenty of fishes in the sea because i feel that does not go for me
if you could be my friend then it would mean the world to me and you would also get lots of roleplay hugs and maybe if you are fine with it roleplay back massages
i am an international student who is studying in a university abroad and the place i am living in is in a countryside and not in a city
she showered and popped her head in to angrily ask where her favorite towel is being a bit of a sociopath it does not bother me the silence but i am annoyed at how long this has persisted when i did nothing but try to accommodate her
i have been thinking a lot about life recently i have had depression anxiety and health issues for more than half my life although i am relatively young i feel that life is pointless i am not religious however i actively read philosophical and religious texts i still have not found a purpose or a calling per se
never happened before even if we do not exchange a lot since the break up two month ago i can imagine all the worst cases scenarios even if my ex and i are in good terms
it hit me really hard and put me in a really bad depression for awhile which then caused issues with us because i was always sad
all the men keep bragging on their new style of outfit and just keep on talking for what seems like an eternity
hello i am looking for new friends someone to talk to anyone therewe are all here because we are already bummed out how about something less depressing
while talking lilly says i really like you a lot i am kind of confused what is going on between us but let us see if we can make it work
you convinced me to risk my naked body to you i do not know if i believe you when you say you deleted those
and i see so many guys not looking for anything serious or just looking for something casual or do not know yet what they are looking for
i just can not explain why i was so oblivious to the world around me i want to go out and meet people just talk to someone in person for half an hour
i want you to write down everything that they personally did not do right to you a quality an attribute the way they spoke to you the way they treated you
like is there something i am missing about myself that just repels people sorry for the long rant surprisingly that is the short version i just do not have anyone to talk to
i sometimes get tempted to reach out to him but i remember that i deserve someone that actually values our connection and treat me with respect
and then i fell for a guy last year in my college i just rly rly need someone to talk to rn
let us assume the symptom is such that it could be related to anxiety but is often a sign of a different condition not related to mental health
instead he told my sister he is okay with being the villain and accused me of hacking him on instagram when i did not he had no proof
i am working on social anxiety and other issies with my therapist i just wish i had something to do on my days off besides watch crunchyroll for hours on end
you gave me hope because the day you turned to me and asked me out i thought i was scum of the earth
the loneliness and inability to connect to anyone has been crushing and somehow somehow i fuck it up with the only two people friendship and relationship wise who have tried to push through the thick ass brick walls i have up and this is how it ends this is just the cherry on top yeah there is no way i am seeing 2021
the first week of the pandemic was the most relaxed i have been in years because i knew that just like me none of our clients were working either and i knew that i had an excuse for not having to drop everything to go see them
a bunch of girls in my class say that they have no friends even though there is a bunch of people surrounding them and their sidekicks this sucks why am i writing this post no one will bother to read this but if you are reading this then thank you i appreciate you taking the time to read this dumb emo post well i guess this is the end of the post i am ending it all
every time i think i am going to overdose i get comforted and scared but i end up throwing up or blacking out and waking up telling myself i will transition i will get small again i will be a woman one day but it never will happen
i fucking hate my body and i wish i was slashed openedi know how to tie a noose but hanging is fucking painful
i just hope you remember who i was and how much i loved you that i truly did care about you and just wanted the best for you
once i cried for like 3 hours straight like noisy messy crying lol and there is no room for me and i am not worth their time
stumbled across some old pics of us together i had deleted all of our pics together so seeing these was really nice
i do not do drugs personally and will never touch but i do not know if its affecting me or not she also starting burning these incense i do not know if that is helpful but i smoked weed once and it really messed my mental state up so i am asking people here for help are contact with those drugs really messing with me i do not really have anywhere else to turn
i am happy i could at least help you in some way i am happy every time you needed me since i met you i could be there to help you
they might smile out in public because they do not want other to know what happen and be a burden to them
it never bothered me much i was okay with it hell i accepted it but this recent situation fucked me up
i was damned either way but i used to make him happy a long time ago i just do not know what changed
not on board with no contact methods to try and get it back that is one thing i do not regret
but the thing was that she would only talk to guys over snap too because she also got anxious when talking to people
now he is saying he never ask for a break he told he did not want a relationship but he is already talking to a new girl
when she started talking to this guy a lot on her campus i tried to be ok with it for a month or so up until he had confessed feelings for her in which i asked her to stop talking to him because it made me uncomfortable
despite it i did end up cryig for a solid half an hour today and relised quickly i needed to speak out and seek some advice from someone who is been in my boots
but then she would have had more to say about that because she drove her last partner into the psych ward and would not take accountability for it
i feel so damn lonely of lately few weeks ago my boyfriend ended the relationship it was difficult but not that much of an issue
i am sorry this is so messy i am a lazy almost 14 yo that does not want to go through the effort of cleaning up this post
ah and what do you do when you feel spike of lonelinessi have always felt a lot lonelier during the holidays but more so this year
i do not know how to resolve the things i did when i was mentally unwell with the person i am now that i am well and would never do those things
i know i have to let her go but it is just so hard we were best friends before we got together and i have no one closer in my life
i even had to think about the future if he had not had broken up with mei could have been at that party you posted on social media had i known about it
while i remember a lot of trauma and some important things i forget things far more frequently than i should and do not remember most of my life
i would not have to deal with racism and stereotypes my entire life and i could see people that look like me in the media all the time
now me hearing their stories of parties and crazy stuff things that i never did i am afraid that they might know my past and judge me right away
they hurt you they told you they would never do it again you believed and forgave them repeat you do not realise how toxic a relationship is until you have room to breathe from them
then she would start asking to come over on other days and i would not be able to say no for fear of making her angry sad or upset with me
i do it too but during quarantine the feeling to be alone is so big i feel like i am sometimes not be wanted
we were still talking every day went out for lunch a couple of times went regularly together to the gym to workout and every time we hung out we still had great energy where we laughed all the time and smiled together
3 months into that break up i met another girl and we got along really well and i would post her occasionally and this is when my ex started texting me back reversing the roles but eventually leading to us getting back together seems foolish of me to have taken her back now
i constantly compare myself and his ex i am always on a quest to prove to myself that he loves me more
it would create a live map similar to live air pollution maps where you could see who in a certain area is lonely and maybe have the opportunity to message them and consider meeting up with them
i am suicidal a lot and i hate it i hate that i let this person have so much power
this hopeless feeling really needs to take a vacation i swear i think i am okay from it but i am not sure what this means
in the end we decided on a friendship pausei do not know how to get him out of there his behavior was just appalling
i get that sometimes people change and drift but its happened to me so many times that i just think people do not like me
i tried for some time to connect with them but it was futile i had not done anything wrong and they still cared for me but could not find time for me
5 weeks ago i still think about how you would twitch in your sleep and wake yourself up i would laugh everytime
the people in my area are complete idiots i live in the south and my county has a high sex trafficking rate are there any ways i can find somebody in my area both friends and girlfriend without having to use apps or something
i would have to live with this forever i do not want that we hope this will be helpful to anyone who is wondering whether something is okay here and which responses to report
she could literally go daysweeks without contact whereas i just want to message her all the time i refrain of course
4 1 month after the bu i wrote her a letter i was moving to her city for school and asked if she wanted to talk about us she said no told me she cared about me said she wanted to be friends and again reiterated need for nc
i want to see my friends or anyone i want to see her i know i am not love of his live or even most important
she was prepared to do whatever it took for as long as it took to prove that she was committed to changing herself
rejected my advance to give oral while he was playing guitar saying it was rude of me to want him to stop playing guitar
i am not even close with this person we are barely in each others lives maybe i am just making excuses but that is the only reason i am alive
i am still recognizing how deep my issues go i do not know if any one would believe this story but this is how it all began
that just is not realistic for weekly therapy sessions and i have been rejected so many times by different therapists over there who do teletherapy
years that passed by and are like empty slots not filled with living i wish people would understand why i want to kill myself this life is a living hell
to be fair n actively isolated me from hanging out with literally anyone else during school and i sure was not the only cringey goblin in there that would have vibed well with me but between my self hatred n making me too scared to betray her for any other friends and my reputation with the majority of the other kids i was completely and utterly alone
because you can try and remove your guilt and sorrow like it matters like running your balls through the saharha desert to profess your feelings of undying love somehow matter but they do not
as far as my personality is concerned my female friends have always said that i am quite cute charming loving and affectionate so i am hoping that is your cup of tea i have always been quite sociable and popular throughout my life but deep down i am fairly shy and introverted i am quite fun and enjoyable to talk to however so i am sure we would get on just fine
i am bipolar and know that sometimes i can be a little crazy so i called my doctor and was able to get my medication changed to a higher prescription
i feel left out and outcast from the society this is starting to effect my daily life i can not concentrate in my studies and i spent nights sobbing and unable to sleep
what do you all do since the fact that we all already exist is the problem here how do you cope with it please feel free to share your experiences too it is very much appreciated
life is ups and downs go on and climb this ladder feel the warm light getting closer i am too weak so i am falling down but it is ok every second is worth the pain as long as i do not hit the ground
i met her once after she left though i did not really understand her the way i do now and i did not ask her to come back
she has made me realize i have never had a safe space where i could tell people how i felt before
that was beginning of something more than friendship something romantic spending more than usual time with each other and doing all kind of stupid shit together
tylenol pills contain something called acetaminophen and it apparently will not really harm you as long as you only take 3000 mgs or less
i will not be there for you if that is the case because it is too hard me and i would rather not see you with someone else
i am so sick of checking my phone to see if you caved and texted me i keep lurking your instagram hoping you unblocked me my daughter keeps asking about you and i am just speechless i look for you everywhere i go
that they were apart of your life but they are not anymore and you will be okay with that bc you will either be happy by yourself or with someone else
28 year old male here this has definitely been the worst year of my life due to covid19 it is been hard dealing with the lockdown not being able to go anywhere and all of the precautions that have been set in place everywhere as well my job at amazon
emotional isolation where someone oftentimes mentally ill or having gone through traumatic experiences feels as if their suffering can never really be 100 shared with others because of how personal and uniquely painful it is forcing them to shoulder their burdens alone
most of the time there were saying very painfully words towards me they were ignored my and they make my a lot of cry during my school time
but each time i went to get up and get it i just ended up sitting back down my boyfriend videochatted me and we talked all day long
where shall i start i always seem ready to help everyone but not myself i am afraid to disappoint people i spent an unnecessary large amount of time in college trying to get a major i wanted but do not anymore and it messed my mental up but trying to continue to make ppl happy at the same time i want to escape from these people because they know about it
just like my father he once told me he is depressed and that if would be better if he died he lashes out at family and resents our father
in saying that i am generally pretty content i can not tell if it is contentedness or if it is just me being apathetic in saying that i do feel happy quite a bit even though i would say my life is pretty bland and i literally have no future
so write down everything that went wrong because i want you to become fully aware train your mind to recognise that this break up was for your good you dodged a bullet
she had no idea how to handle this confrontation she buckled and apologized profusely wishing she never did this to me
the problem with that is i would have to take time off of work and i need money to get out of my current situation which is the because for my suicidal ideation
i do not know what to do since i do not want to seem like i am trying to force a friendship if that makes sense
i have a girlfriend but she has been extremely distant at this point and i feel like she is no longer attracted to me and that she would be much happier if i did not exist
i am diagnosed with depression ptsd anxiety i try my best to care about myself and get help therapy meds coking skills etc
i felt like the biggest loser on christmas day i hate myself so much i was so beat up from lunch with my dads side that i ditched going to my mothers side of the family for dinner i could not bare to face anymore people with my presence or subject them to it at this point like my dads side i am so sick of myself i just want to sleep forever
he made a comment about my weight one day and with all of the other emotional burden happening turned into an eating disorder
i am stuck with thoughts and actions that will never go away as long as i live its been a week since he said this to me and i am killing myself over this
we were together for 8 months and met on tinder because it was quarantine and nothing else to do i take a while to open up to people and i tend to hide my emotions behind humor
i hate how i look even though i am constantly told i look good i am a dancer so i get into situations where people judge me based off my looks often but my resentment of my own appearance alone is enough to make me want to off myself
all of this have lead me to focus on setting very unrealistic goals and expectations on areas i ambitiously take even though i have little to no skills in delivering results
i am sorry for this post that does not make much sense and i know it is up to me to try and get into better habits i just need to write something somewhere right now
and jazz lots of gypsy jazz lately i was okay just laying in bed with him i just wanted him to feel better
i just cut off all my friends and sabotaged my relationship with my ex boyfriend just because i could not control my emotions
not sure if this is exactly the right place to put this but i thought this was still relevant and appropriate i am making a playlist for my mental health and i have a couple of songs and i am trying to find ones that are similar the songs are
everything happiness for a reason even if it does not seem like it and sometimes it happiness to teach us a lesson some longer than others
i do not know if she ever had real feelings for me or not and i will never know now we both left to different states at the end of august and went our separate ways
the first 2 dates he came to see me in the city the last one i went to go see him this was about a week ago i had a work meeting that morning so i left his house and when i walked back in he was on the phone with someone
i have had to do this before back in 2013 i was diagnosed bipolar severe anxiety disorder and a touch of schitozeffective
this is something i have to deal with daily wherever i go people want me to off and it is really driving me crazy because i want to do something with my life but i can not people are going to treat me the same
i am feeling lonely what should i do how to fight it i feel like i am always the one to ask people to hang out first or talktext people first
i have recently started seeing a therapist and i do not have family to turn to as i think they are still back in chicago doing drugs like they were 8 years ago when i left
we have different views of each other and how we play a role in each others life and i know mine is vastly different than hers
at my worst i literally could not get out of bed no matter how hungry or thirsty or anything i could not find the energy to get myself up
so i left so i went from having 20 or so friends to 2 all lost in a span of months
i told her to be formal and asked her to meet me to breakup the conversation ended badly bec i am the only one who did the talking the only thing she saidnis this i love you but i do not like you anynore i am sorry
ex gf broke up with me after giving me an ultimatum of getting her a ring before she goes to grad school or break up since it shows i was not serious
took a walk to think about things smoked a joint had some drinks and i just want to go i want to think things over and i want to find that one thing but it is not there i have been afraid all this time that i might miss something but the things i have seen lately are not it i ruined everyrging i previously enjoyed by tryong it again none of it is the same it is just flat disappointing
i started talking to this girl a couple of months ago but she just sees me as her best friend which is extremely painful because i have never loved someone as much as i loved her
you would be disappointed when you find that the one you love can let go so easily that they can hurt you real bad without even considering all those good memories or all of these nice gestures you have done for them out of pure love and a passionate heart
the amount of things i am expected to already know and the new things i have to learn is exponentially increasing day by day
i do not remember exactly when i started selfharming amidst my school and family troubles but i can truly say that however an unhealthy coping mechanism it was it helped me survive a lot of things
i know that i am very weak and i feel pathetic for even having these problems knowing that there are people who have been through incredibly traumatizing things
so it is a really long an complicated story but essentially my first ever high school sweetheart long term bf of almost 4 years broke up with me exactly 3 months ago completely out of the blue
i started collecting child prn and kept it up for nearly a year before my parents discovered it and deleted it all
i have been like this for as long as i can remember my concellor told me it is from the physical and emotional trauma i experienced as a child and it is something that i have struggled with greatly
everything is so much easier for other people i have to try way harder than anyone just to do something simple
i called him that night and told him i did not think we should keep seeing each other because i thought it would be unfair to me to only see each other on his terms that it seemed like he was not willing to compromise
or another that taught you how to help your children or friends with bpd it is not over though they still have it i do not want to go anywhere because of the virus
i eat a lot when i am depressed i wish i was the kind to not be able to eat nothing at all it is just been nothing but work and suicidal thoughts daily
whenever i start to miss my ex i remind myself of how much i hated his friends my intention is not to die but to hurt myself really badly i want out for a little bit
anyway any tips as to where i might find good discussions about this stuff is welcome as well as if there are discord servers or whatever
the last years were enough i was more than i thought i would be able to handle but i stood up again and again
i have been talking to a friend for a few years now she was abused as a child beaten and raped when she was in high school she is been through so much she had a bad girlfriend and got hurt by her her now fiance used to be abusive up until a few months ago when i pushed my friend to meet with the fiance and the fiance therapist
i hope he treats her better i hope he does not hide her like he hid me i hope he does not cheat on her like he cheated on me i hope he is happy that is all i ever wanted
that she can not get up the stairs in also another note is she is a homebody and retired so she will always be home especially with covid
i was a prochoice activist and would have wanted to pass the law of assisted suicide in my country i am nearing graduation in law but i do not see the point in any further suffering of myself for this asshole world
it did not help that similar thing happened with another awesome women who joined a few months before i left except i was not heartbroken i was just resigned by then
i know she loves me so much but as long as i am still alive i am hurting her she constantly worries that she will come home from work and find me dead
i then asked her if she still wanted to get together sometime in the future and she said probably in the future but not right now
for me i can not sleep at night wondering whether i will be single forever or not sometimes life feels like your the bad guy and everyone else is the good guy
block them everywhere no contact is so important she was my high school sweetheart she was such a loving girl and caring
i imagine how painful it is years or decades for the angel death to take me the waiting is becoming more and more unbearable
and one simple question does anyone know what household toxinsdrugs kill and how painful are they thanks in advance to those who can answer
just having it dangled in front of you with all the possibilities when you finally meet someone really special and then it falling apart as quickly as it started just really blows
i can not even look my mother in the eyes any more she is on my back constantly about being in a better mood and the pressure just makes me resent her because i physically can not do it
they also used to use me as a scapegoat of sorts it was hell after the break up it seemed things might have been able to work out between my ex and i
and i know a lot of you are in her position and you are asking yourself why do not you just try again because even though we love each other we deserve someone who wants the same future who wants to talk to their partner more than just the bare minimum who does not fight every day
with no one noticing in my eyes and being to insecure to talk to anyone about it without them freaking out and trying to intervene to hard in turn ruining my life in an even worse way
we had an amazing relationship always supported each other on everything not even once we fought we had disagreements but always talked it out without ever attacking one another
it does get better i never thought i would see the day where i would be unusually calm to see him move on from me
and next week i felt totally fine surprised myself i thought i got over and now i am good i wanted to be her husband
i am going to take a walk around town to see if i do and probably talk to some people before i make any permanent decisions
my dad what did you do me she was slamming it into head my dad so what do you know what you just did
above all i just want to have someone to whom i could dedicate my whole being to to whom i could give everything i have and so much more
she also did not even love me in the first place so that adds to my depression and loneliness i always do my part to act like i am belong i laugh at their jokes because it is really fun
i am 17m going to be 18 in early march idk too much about other countries but here in australia 18 is the legal age for basically everything which means lots more freedom and that is when you are considered an adult
that being said my wife of 7 years now started feeling really bad and paranoid just over three years ago shortly after the birth of our daughter
what i did not notice was that while i was trying to control one bad habit i developed at least a couple of bad coping mechanisms
he is the owner so i can not delete it myself what should i do i am sorry if this is not the right place to post
basically what happens is if i get sad or depressed i will kind of attack my friends of i am jealous of for being happy without me and try to bring them to be sad with me almost
a part of me relieved a part of me destroyed i have to really let go and move on now why does it feel impossible
you with all the questions and only some of the answers it is you who deserve love do not worry i have contacted her immediate family she is safe
i am sure millions of others to it was cool in the beginning but now that i have not seen people or done any social activities in months i feel disconnected just to see or talk to people in real life would be such a relief i am also not looking forward to this upcoming winter i already get sad and i do not need anything else to make me feel bad
even writing this at the back of my mind i keep thinking of what if questions what if there is a fire what if i am ill what if something bad happens i feel constantly anxious
that hurt me because i know he knows that is not true i did not realize until i thought about my current dating life that i am the same way
and i am not necessarily saying that it is because of my anxiety but i felt the mental health sub would understand a little
i feel trapped in this loop that i cannot escape i am sorry for you but it will all get better you should go talk to a therapist
i asked for love and god gave me troubled people to help i asked for favors and god gave me opportunities
i never physically cheated but if we are all honest emotionally cheating is still cheating if you really had problems you would call a hotline are you fucking stupid those people do not even care
i am telling you make a good playlist it helps so much these are just some of my go tos what are yours
it leaves me with an empty void and a crushing loneliness that nothing seems to be able to fill but the desperation and frustration for being ignored by my own wife got me mad
they refused help every time it went down hill and they were brought to the hospitalit is not fair i truly want to end my lifei need someone to talk please chat with me
i did not think much of it but later i caught her in another lie and it turned out that there were 3 other guys on that private story and she knew what she was doing was wrong because she hid it from me
so finally i got my boxes to ship surprisingly after we brought my last two boxes to ship he brought me to work but i cannot tell you guys how drained i feel i did not even fight him back verbally or anything i literally barely did or said shit today and he was raging all this ugliness and hate towards me and i am beyond drained
now the first thing we have to realise is that the only what you had together may be broken but you are not broken
it might sound shallow but i just feel betrayed and that in the end he would choose to care for her than for me when he could not even give me a proper break up and a good straight no
my first girlfriend cheated on me too she still wants to be friends and i tried so hard but i am just hurting
i try so hard to do no contact but since i am the project manger at one of his properties 1 yr ago i quit a good paying job which is how i am surviving money wise because of covid and not many jobs in bfe plus i own land next to him he is come to his land maybe 3 times a month
i know it is not against me and that he s suffering the break up too but i feel so empty i do not know who i am anymore
sort of depressing to realize i never get calls like that but also reminded me that being happy to answer the phone is actually a thing and could become a thing
i feel like there really is no release at all what can i do how do i stop being like this and start being normal am i just supposed to wait until i break completely open i feel like i am going crazy
i realized the heart breaks also because it needs to the more it does it reveals parts of ourselves that we knowingly and unknowingly attached to others the parts us that we should work on your own we freely gave away that power to people who do not need or deserve it
and my boss did not wanted to neither had the resources according to him to get more people to work so i spent 5 years by myself in a room full of empty computers with him working in the mornings and coming later in the afternoon to keep working on the studio in his separate office
these goto copes have been made a criteria list to be met everyday for the past month and i have succeeded in fulfilling the task but i now feel like it is
i do have friends but those are acquaintances i can not say anything about that i have also sought help in school and other ways but nothing helps
finding connections with guys it feels like they can not compare none are as affectionate caring loving and protective of me as him none who would care for me maybe i do not deserve happiness life just wants to toy with me and dangle in front of my face with a carrot
my family has a feeling there is something wrong with me and would like me to talk a therapist it would probably be ok to talk to a therapist but i feel like i am just making a fuss and my problems are not really badreal
i struggle to cultivate deep attachments in relationships and it is your friendsfamily that you should be able to share your worries with or so i am told
never any hope never anything to look forward to everything good turns into a disaster going through the motions like a machine
even though it is been three measly days a lots happened in the world the first vaccines start next week we came out of lockdown and you are seeing your other musician friends either tomorrow or the day after for a jam sesh speaking of tomorrow it would have been another milestone you probably know this i wonder if you will think about it tomorrow i will miss you
i did not actually talk to a human being for around 6 months now i mean like a real conversation not a job interview or what is for dinner
if i can not fix this i will feel this way till i die and i do not want that i am losing hope
i can not help but be curious to see these things if i proceed to watch a lot of graphic real videos will that deteriorate my mental state
now this being said i still hated that office job as it was still stressful by nature but now that my mindset seems to be better i actually feel like i want to improve my self
so every excuse she had she usedproud of myself i know that sounds really messed up but strangling myself somehow made me calm down
i am doing it while awake and not really able to control it i just googled some excercises and hope they will help
her laugh was truly adorable then there was the fourth dream i found myself in my home and could hear a cello being played
a big problem i have is that my dreams have become so vivid and only about her and her rejecting me blocking me walking away and every day i start with an opened wound because of it
problem is nobody will give her adderal because she smokes weed even tho she has gotten it before she would never abuse pills she hates all medicine
i can not really explain just one because for it and it is been long enough now that i think i need to make some sort of change in my life but has anyone else ever felt like they are the strong one and that those around you rely on you for this reason my friends and family have not taken my mental health very seriously in the past so when i communicate concerns that i may be in decline they simply deny that it could be happening
but now i just do not know how i feel like i am somewhere between sadness and nothing i feel like it is not right to forget them and go on with my life like nothing has happened
we are going to get out the pipes of our heater out so the oxygen can ran out and we suffocate when we are sleep that is the best idea because there is no pain and we can die togheder that is the best
those feelings along with my loss of the one person i loved with every fiber of my being makes me want to commit suicide
no one sees my efforts why do i have to state the fucking obviousthen when i do get with guys the ask me weird sexual fetish questions or if i am trans
do americans not value their purest first love like asiansi am from china and my bf is from louisiana there is a wedding and you without reason
i still do not know why i can not see myself as someone great i just get so disappointed every now and then
happiness is a choice not a result nothing will make you happy until you choose to be happy no person will make you happy unless you decide to be happy your happiness will not come to you it can only come from you
i ended things that night but he does not remember anything and the next day reiterated what i knew already of not wanting to set boundaries
he seemed so happy and carefree even though he knew our breakup hurt me really bad and he did not want to break up either what he said but he felt i was unhappy and thought breaking up would mean i would be happier in the long run
i have never had a crush not once do not get me wrong i am straight i have those thoughts here and there but i have never looked at a female and thought damn i am interested in you
she kept asking me about it asking if she was better than her how she was if she was hotter and i just eventually just stopped replying
was struggling before covid after being fired for ripping apart some ligaments in my hand i was a lineman i did not do anything wrong and they told me it was the hand
i am not looking forward to the next year because it will need me to be amazing everyone thinks i am amazing but i do not believe i can do it and i think i just want to give up and die i want this and yet i do not help me i can not do it
no offense to my psychiatrist he is nice and all but i do not think i need to figure myself out i have gone 5 years without any sort of help so i pretty much had to do it all myself
after being single for over a decade i think i have become self centered to the point where i cannot partner
i enjoyed that you were the person i could talk to about everything or almost everything there is some teleological aspect to our relationship that does not coincide with reality
i would say i have a pretty healthy relationship with my sexuality probably so i do not think this is a guilt thing could this be more a chemical thing i really need to know should i just stop ever masturbating then if it is messing with my brain or is it something fixable
but i wanted more i wanted her back minimal texts or greeting for days i asked whyshe said she is busy at work
and quite frankly speaking patronizing and insulting it may or may not be the case that i am the root of all my misery
wake up new day breathe do something different do one of your habits in different order see the change that it has on the rest of your day
a friend and i wanted to help some of you dealing with loneliness and provide the idea of using authenticity to help manage loneliness its an interesting concept so to speak and just wanted to help those going through this
it was very hard for me to open up to anyone since then and as i need the emotional connection and feel safe the guy i met on tinder was the first one i got physically intimate with after that i felt safe he was incredibly caring understanding and sweet and it was all about me
it is still hard and i am still fighting my demons my friend said she will call me everyday to see if i have coped that day
i have heard she is playing the field right now as am i but i would really like to get back together with her
i can not distract myself from these thoughts and even playing my favourite game will not even satisfy me i can not concentrate and i feel this overthinking is potentially dangerous
i have yet to cry about it or anything and it feels weird i could cry over melanie right now but jordan i am not sure
today i have cried a lot so many times i feel so lonely no one contact me or want to go out if i am not asking them i think i am depressed i want all of this to end because i cannot bare it anymore i just want someone who can help me
hopefully my family and her family can be friends even tho me and her are separated or taking a long break if we do get back together hopefully we do me and her have helped each other a lot even her mom saying i was the reason she genuinely smiled after all these years not smiling like that
words may not even be enough to describe it my hands and legs were even shaking a bit i always gave love but never get any back
i still love her and will continue to for a while but it is just best for me to focus on myself from here on out no matter how much i want to talk to her and have her in my life
the reason i think so is that he is the biggest simp you could imagine so i just hope she needs him only for feeling better during break up period
i told him good luck with that the vomit and i told him i was going home his dad was awake so i told him he should go check on him
5 days ago i had a panic attack stupid me took 15 migraine pills and felt like i was going to die
i live with my boyfriend and his family his family are amazing and love me for who i am but it is not the same
the thought of meeting a significant other just feels like an overwhelming time commitment it would be nice to have someone but the effort to go on all those dates to find them is a lot
is anyone up to chitchat to talk about random things movies series politics talk about relationship i do not mind i am up to talk about everything
i wish i could just tell them i know it is the easiest thing to do it will not be pleasant but way smarter than trying to do this dumb shit
to clarify he drove into a car that was not even moving on a bicycle no one was in the car only my dad was injured
every pill that i take every line that i snort every blunt that smoke keeps killing what is inside of me my feelings are gone forever i feel so fucking dead inside my memories are gone forever i am forgetting who i am
my dad helped me move around and other things in the hospital because i was afraid the nurses would hurt me seeing as my leg was fractured
i am so so so sad i am worried that my message will just push him further away though i do not really understand why
i asked if there were any alternatives to the police and they told me the best option was to call ems
i sit around numb feeling like i am on the verge of tears if someone tries to talk or interact with me
this is mostly a rant but to any guys out there who ended a relationship because you did not see a future do you still think about them do you miss them any advice here would help
ever since then i have hated the month of december and end up intaking more alcohol then i normally would my grandfather birthday shares they day i cuaght that thing sleep with some one so disgusting that a day in hell is a vacation
3 days later she broke up with me and surprise it was for someone else and then said that i cheated on him and i am a liar
that is the first question to ask yourself with any thought ask yourself first do i like this thought is this thought useful or insightful ask yourself that
i told him everything about my feelings for him is he thinking about that at all i think i surprised him
for some background of info i was diagnosed with adhd in middle school and i believe i may have some other condition because i have had some issues with socialization and mentally since i was a child
that night i gained a whole lot of anxiety and i could barely do every day tasks without thinking of him and the message he left bouncing around in my head
past events that have happened in my life seem to follow me around and pull me back like a leash with a retractable cord
last year my girlfriend was having trouble with getting university sorted so me and my mum decided to lend her 2000 to help with accommodation
she saw a picture of me without a shirt on ig and made it a huge problem she told me she has not slept all night because of itthe good old guilt trip i told her it is not a big deal for me and it is not even naked as she explained it to be
i am scared i am scared of life growing up being alone staying sad for the rest of my life failing not living enough wasting my time not being good enough i feel like i can not chill the fuck out
i am always triggert because i know that i have depressions diagnosed but i would never have the balls to post it everywhere like its not something serious
so i am posting on behalf of one of my closest friends i am twenty eight 28 and she is twenty four 24
i feel like i should be scared but i am honestly happy i want this all to be over alreadlyi miss you i wish you would have taken the time to talk to me
i have been running on empty for so long and i just am burnt out i do not want to die but i can not keep living like this
if you put on clothes and you do not like the way you look in the you change them you do not just go out in them then force yourself to wear them
i have always preferred the company of a good book or movie or taking long walks i live with the fear that i will feel lonelier with the company of some people
i did what they said and the police dept forwarded the call to the florida 911 sorry for the writing just not doing well
i need something to change today made me feel so dead insidei am going to kill myself on january 13th it is my 3 year sobriety date
stone cold says girlfriends are like shoes you have to try them on no tears nothing seems completely finehi i am fairly new here but i want to ask if anyone knows any solution to my problem
he constantly made remarks about my body i am 118 pounds and how he wished i would go to the gym or do squats
it does not help that i am still processing some rough break ups both friendships and romantic i am a second year student now hell
depressed maybe the individual does not have any friends is kept socially isolated has lost their job or a loved one in which case it is perfectly normal to be sad
to end this off i need help in a way this is my last hope to the world that i may still be needed
i texted him on another account apologizing and asking for a real goodbye but he ignored me i think i am in love with him
when it does come in you can bet our kids will get spoiled rotten because i will happily buy what they need and what they want which is very little not surprisingly and make their new year hopefully a little brighter than this year has been
so it is been less than an year all was good but something changed three months back we had a fight and it became quiet violent he asked me to leave the house and could not stop screaming these episodes became frequent he drinks copious amounts of alcohol and smokes a lot too this was not an issue before
they used to fight everyday i still remember one day how their usual shouting escalated to throwing things and i had to take my younger sister into my bedroom and play guitar while singing to her to pretend everything was fine
it is tiresome i do not wan to live the one person i loved to bits that stayed by my side for almost a year is gone
i am working on raising my standards and establishing boundaries with out feeling guilty i still have a lot of baggage to unpack before i even think of attempting to date again
i am at a very all time low in my life was living for world of warcraft but this current expansion i can not even keep my characters alive
if you only knew how much i miss youif you only knew what i go through without you by my side
then again that is also my fault because reddit is insensitive but i have no one else to talk to about this
i really hope she has some sense to recognize that i am not a lying conniving person there is validity to what i say
so i am dating a girlf18 and we like each other as hell we love being next to each other but there are some times that i get myself in questions just as do i really like her did i just start dating her because she liked me and i was interested am i being truly about myself and my opinions the point is
when you have down days i will be there for you and i know you will be for me i will be there to care for you when your not well and help you get better
i got upset because i had told him not to involve other people in our issues and i did not hack him so i messaged him
the pain gets worse everyday my earliest memories are my parents saying i was an accident and that they wish they never had me
my boyfriend is not great at dealing with me when i am like that he will demand to know why i am upset when in times like that i just need people to distract me and remind me that everything is okay
i do not have it in me to call women bitches and treat them like how most guys treat women these days that get the results i want so i did what i felt was the next best thing and decided to look at the bright sides of being single
i hope you are happy all of my friends and our mutual friends all cared about you so much they all shared my feelings of worry they believed we were the model couple they were just as sure as i was just as stupidly sure that we would last forever
i feel unbelievably lonely because the pandemic has made it impossible to meet anyone not to get with i do not have any drive for that just for friends to attempt to distract myself
what can i do the next time i think they are talking about me i know he does it i have read messages about me on his phone
after a couple of dates he told me that he was scared of committing seriously to a relationship due to trauma from a past relationship and that he needed time to think about when he would be comfortable moving forward
update 2 still no definite answer but a we will still meet when i am back home which is indefinite asked him if he can explain more but he did not respond anymore
but five rocky years of falling second to his addictive personality despite my best efforts whatever purpose my life has burns dimmer and dimmer
tldr i keep having long dreams about falling into a relationship and it is hurting my mental healthit will be so much fun no it will not
firstly we made up after some timethe first breakup was because there have been some fights between usi regret comparing him to movies other relationships and even to dumb reddit posts
sometimes even though i am happy most of the time i get really sad when i miss a hug from a girl so much when i realize i am actually alone at all of my decisions there is no one i can talk to about my occasional sadness
from the very start i fought for you i ran till my legs broke i screamed till no sound came out i said sorry a million times till it lost its meaning for things that are not my fault i was tired of fighting tired of feeling like complete shit i had to do something
if they are having a good time i want them to have a good time i do not want to bring anybody down because people need a good day with everything going on in the world
i do not know if i can live like this any longer my mom and i were recently thinking about moving to a different state south of where we live where the weather is sunny all year round but i do not know if moving to a different state will change things for us in terms of living happier lives i have never been to this state before so it is hard to say
which i am mainly glad for so i do not have to see him yet and now i use his jacket as a thing to help me feel less alone
telling me she was not ready for a relationship and still had to come over the abuse relationship she had before and that it was too early for her
i left my so from our usual sleep call so i could cry like a loser about things i can not get out of my head
the public school system and middle schoolers do not mix well with someone like me i was harassed and sexually assaulted
apologies for my language this is not my mother tongue just want to vent out and scream i am so irritable and honestly pretty depressed like is there something i am missing about myself that just repels people
he lied to my face changed her name in his phone i contacted the girl she sent me the screenshots
just like the first one but i did not have anything important to do that day i fall asleep because i did not put the alarm on my phone and i woke up by myself at 1130 when i would usually wake up at 1000 thanks to the alarm i did not miss any online class or anything but that did not stop me from crying
nothing is more important than your mental health let it come first i am a overthinker and i worry so much it ruins my day most of the time
i had a dear friend of 5 years who i am very intimate with last week she was so frustrated she could not help she first distanced herself then left me last week she was my closest friend and the only friend i talked to regularly
i got all my answers and yet i still doubt and over think and that makes me have even more questions
anyways it has been nearly 3 months one month after that day i found out she was dating a new guy out of the nowhere and since a few weeks ago i realized that her new boyfriend is her classmate i had this guy on whatsapp but never talked to him i am not sure whether it can be called a rebound or not
because i am curious now how she can survive when my heart is broken and she seems to be happily moving on
i was in therapy in high school and it cost my family a lot and i feel like such a fucking failure to still be so broken
i am 19 years old and a few months back i was on a dating app meant primarily for casual flings and i matched with a bunch of people most were bots some were scammers some were real people i just did not click with etc you get the point some people i sexted with
and anxious i feel like i have given so so much emotionally and physically to this relationship i can not let it go
he made me feel so incredibly safe and he made me love my body more i had already done so much work to love my body entirely before we got together
i feel like my own head is so different than the way everyone else sees mei am a junior at my dream university
him there is no way apparently he caught us having sexhim really then people are just liars to me but nothing seems to workand the worst part is i genuinely enjoy self harm
at least in my teen years i used to play games all day and do not bother much now its work and fighting loneliness
i can not help worrying that everyone else is getting to know each other as i sit isolated at home not knowing what to text anyone or how to converse and get to know people through just text
depression anxiety and even those existential crisis will not be a problem anymore because you will feel they are not justified enough to dictate your state of emotion
he just said that i am dead to him that it would be better if i am not here anymoreit is been a shitty year a shitty life i am just utterly alone
we met on the internet when i was 12 and she was 10 we were not immediately friends but after some time we connected through our shared love of anime and music we texted almost every day and called weekly eventually we met in my city and she slept over a couple days we had amazing friendship even called each other sister
i am mostly curious i am two weeks into being single and considering downloading apps but i have always dated people that were friends first how did you guys meet the partner that made you get over the one before
they found my friend in the bed surrounded by vomit and called an ambulance they told me she would not be alive if it were not for me and thanked me
how many levels were you connected at we have physical mental emotional spiritual 4 levels of connectioni do not know why but christmas makes me overwhelmed with loneliness i just feel so fucking sad
i did not want to report because did not want him in more trouble he is done this himself although i can not help but think i have ruined his life he is convinced me
i thought that my problems lay with me i thought that what was missing in my life was other people
i do not want to make these promises and sometimes i end up worrying because of hypothetical promsiesthis christmas made me realize that i am alone and miserable despite the things i have in life
my problems sort of feed into each other so i will go into those first i am in my mid 30s male straight
and i honestly did not know how to process it and i still do not know how to process it you are so good at pretending that you care about people just to make them happy
she told me that i did not completely ruin our relationship and that she will give me last chance to earn her trust because i still mean very much to her and that she does not want to lose me from her life
chances are very high that you have already lost at least a few opportunities to meet good people only because you let some fear stop you when you had the chance to interact with them can be fear of rejection fear of being judged fear of not being accepted and so on and so forth what would have happened if you had not listened to your fears
the instant i typed it i froze i just froze mouth open i could not believe i typed that it was not something i knew and just like that i felt euphoric i am still riding that high but its so weird to go from the saddest possible to feeling incredibly good
he hid all of the messages from me was mad at me when i found out he deleted some texts from a female coworker as well
my parents were not giving me much attention so now i am searching for it at all costs i really enjoy making creative stuff but i do not feel like making it for myself
even though they may have had an amazing day themselves they ignored that fact and they decided to let that go in order to focus on making you feel better because their happiness is also based on yours and the love to share that with you
after that i was doing a lot better i was making progress psychologically and learning how to train my mind then the pandemic hit
so this has been my 2nd longest relationship i have ever been in and i ended it i have ended almost all of my relationships and it gets really tiring we dated for a year and a half we were also long distance
i was watching sad movies and listening to sad music last weeki am lucky enough to have a place with my grandmother for now but after that who knows
i am tempted to join her can not even tell my family because i am not out he started yelling that i needed to get my shit done and not waste my time with him
just curious what do boys do after a break up are you sad or you do not realize that she is not yours anymore a few months later
i am not even interested in the thought of moving on because i know that i could never ask for someone like her to ever come around again
we have to realise that only what we had with them is broken we are not broken we have not lost our skills
is this normal i want someone to wake me upi have got no reason to talk to her every day i am usually busy with myself
i am at a point where i no longer care about myself anymore i doubt i can trust anyone the same way i trusted my ex anymore
i just want to know how a good guyguy friendship looks like because i have never really had one the only platonicly attractive thing about me to other dudes is that i can attract girls if they happen to be in a situation to see me with someone i feel so lonely and i just feel like the only true friends i have had are girls i have dated and a couple childhood friends
i have been having a rough time as of recently because of evermore increasingly intrusive thoughts low on patience becoming misanthropicpessimistic lappel du vide etc
this is one of our free workshops organized by the prehealth national honors society where we cover social isolation personality creativity and mental health with a meditation exercisequestions answers
i am watching from an outsiders view into everyone elses lives and it just kind of hurts i want to cry about it but i know that there is no point because i can not control it
i am doing some research for my art project and it is centred around how mental illnesses play with the persons life and mind so i want to get other peoples opinions thoughts and feelings about their mental health for example how does it make you feel or like a short summary of your experience with it
my first girlfriend broke up with me on friday october 13th 2017 after dating for three years i broke up with my second girlfriend on november 25th 2019 after dating for about a year
now my world has gone silent and while i can handle being alone its the fact that i have no connections with anyone zero nothing
at this point i am in shock at how she could do this after telling me that she loved me over the past couple of months and she is blocking me on everything
i feel like it is triggering a massive amount of anxiety in me i feel like i can not breath again and nothing makes sense
the only other time this happened was when i smoked weed please help all i need is one response my anxiety over it all has pretty much gone or been overcome i am feeling good
but i can not everytime i miss her so much i have done nothing but try and try to find people for years and years and nothing
i do not know what i am feeling is it be i am still heartbroken over what happened bc i know i love him still but my heart feels heavy
you then imagine them telling you they regret it all and that they will never find someone like you that they want you back and will do whatever it takes to make it happen that they thought about you every step of the way
i immediately cried but he said it was all way before me and he can unfollow everyone if it makes me uncomfortable
they ended up trying to admit me to the eating disorder ward and gave me an iv created a new fear great and discharged me after 10 hours
26 m 16 years of depression anxiety and awaiting a bpd assessment i can not deal with this we were helping each other with everything and now i am all alone
we live together with our puppy and so i am staying in a friends spare room for the foreseeable future have not told my parents yet but i will tomorrow could do with someone to talk to as i have been having some scary thoughts
i do not know if maybe it is a way for me to defend myself or what i was born to a mother who was hooked on heroin and crack
i planned to do some shit last year but the fact that i could scar my family for life by doing so kept me from it
i am still unsure of what i am hoping to get out of sharing my feelings with strangers online excuse my poor grammar and the long essay
does it sound like i have depression i could just be having a bad day and overreacting a bit i guess
any way he need it if he get happiness not enough it start slowly remind you about it so you start searching
even speakingwriting posts can sometimes feel daunting for some reason when it is been a while since i have put my linguistic abilities to the test
1 how are you feeling this friday how did you feel this week2 how have the feelings been showing up for you physically or mentally
6 weeks ago she broke up with me i told her i respected her choice and have left her alone since but i really liked everything about her and the friends and family around her
ironically i just tried to tell my best friend about that problem but she told me she does not have time bc she is sleeping over at her crushes place
and because i am already struggling so much with my mental health that is pure poison for mewill finish this if i get questions or if i just feel like it
everything was going great until she out of the blue stated that she finds it kind of odd that we are celebrating an anniversary
did therapy again lately with 2 different psychologists and it just felt like a nice talk with a friend nothing really useful
excuse i am confused and need an explanation of why things did not work out why it is bs just accept you were with someone incompatible
i asked him to unfollow her and he agreed but has not which makes me so upset1 academically i went to good schools and i am not in debt
how long does this last how do you stop it i am older than him he really just left our apartment and everything to me
i never seriously consider suicide only really as a hypothetical at most hobbies but instead i just sit here so fucking sad scared and useless
they have each other and i am never going to be accepted into their group just hit me hella hard that i have never had a group of friends and i never will
how does someone like myself who has adhd aspergers depression ptsd anxiety and autism deal with loneliness besides wanting to kms how does one deal with it i have never dated only have a small group of friends which half are dying including me like seriously what do i do
i was in a really rocky relationship at the time that was on the way down we were basically trying to work out our separation in a healthy way cuz we had a child
i am a 30 years old woman and at this age i should be married and have a family half a year since he left me yet i am still not over it
i just want to have a normal life i do not want this feeling i do not want this pain i do not want to be lost anymore i need to scape from this
and again i should be asleep but i am typing this at 7 am i can not take it anymore i am so tired
i made it clear that i am not looking for anything and he told me that he is not looking either he just takes things as they come and he is still figuring things out and rebuilding himself but then we both got swept up pretty quickly
i told the girl she should start sitting with my friends and me because we had more fun she eventually developed feelings for me
i know i have my daughter but i still do not feel close to her i should but that is a whole other set of feelings
and the question she asked me was what gave me the epiphany with a lot of things she opened the flood gates and made me feel safe and loved
they were once your favorite dream to wake up to they once made you start your day better than most because you saw them in your sleep
and here i am put into the same familiar situation of convenience vs me and my friends choosing convenience over me
my life has been weird my parents tell me that when i was a baby i never cried to get anything
i can still make even you laugh make the people around laugh as i tell jokes that make me look like a fool
but no matter how much i try how many people i contact about it how many times i go to the er with a severe panic attacks i keep getting turned away somehow
ok so i did fuck up my last few relationships i was not the best partneri hate living alone with a disability and people where i am at are not open nor approachable to make friends
hi this is my first reddit post i am 17 years old i cut myself first in my 8th grade and only my dad knows about it
i think i at one point was not like this at allbut maybe a year or two back it just hit me that i do not feel anything insideand now i do not even really value people at all
a few months ago i felt the best i could ever feel but since a few weeks i started to feel super insecure and i am scared i am going to lose all my friends soon idk why
my friend has a history with anxiety turned eating disorder they are scared to tell this to a health professional because it is their lifelong goal to join the military and they are worried that having that on their health record would mean an instant disqualification from what i understand they want to enlist and hope they die in duty
my mother was here tonight her advice knowing i am struggling and have anxiety around this to begin with to just get a job that it is my fault for getting such a useless degree that she does not feel sorry for me because at least i have a completed education all said like it was a funny observation
it is like i have no attention span yet when i turn my phone off and lay there in the moment i feel uneasy and restless
few months forward and i found out that she met this guy from other country in an online game during the quarantine and that she is speaking with him for hours every day and fell in love with him
i did everything to avoid school it is no ones fault but my own that i do not have an education and lonely without any real companions i feel like the only thing left for me is to die
i plan on going today and just want to talk to someone as i slowly pass do not feel pressured to do so thanks
i just want someone to tell me that my thinking is wrong and that he should be here and suicide is the worst option possible
i eventually found a medicine which has a drug called risperidone while i was washing his clothes his parents have been giving it to him since the last fifteen days he seem to have had an six years back
which is hard enough in my mental state and doing these things makes life easier and better but not necessarily for finding someone or for not being lonely
so i texted him some days later and told him that i thought it would be nice if we could meet for lunch soon to go over things again since i felt like i was ready to do that
just to let you know i am one of you going to tell a little been rarely thinking of suicide for mb 34 years since around 13yo having really no one to talk with except classmates who are sometimes not better than a piece of shit sry admins and all hard truth parents not giving me what i need note i do not ask loads of money but just kind of support
she wants him back christmas eve and christmas morning to open presents and then she immediately wants them all gone fuckin loon she is a nurse and i use quotations here for good reason here who only believes covid exists when it does not impede on her feelings
the third time he ended it again and it was kind of out of nowhere as i thought we were doing really good
i am on the autism spectrum i hate myself for it no matter how hard i try i will never get to be normal
whether it fighting for the love we have for each other or overcoming an obstacle that has been put in front of us
i need someone to give me good news something that will just remind me that there is good news out there
i am so tired and alone i really do not know what to do now her older sister knows that we are official and was very supportive
j was so drunk and out of it that when i did not say i love you back she got supper upset and started talking about her ex who also rejected her
but yeah i never gave it much thought and randomly remembered that detail weeks after and i do wonder if that added to his distance but i do not know
i think this is why this heartbreak has been so tough for me it is not only because i broke up with my ex it is the holidays my birthday passed her birthday is coming up it is also because i am restricted by the pandemic i am unemployed and have to go to court to fight my exwife my heartbreaks or is turmoil with all these things right now and it is making want to cling to her more
i just want to know if mental health is playing into this so i can appraoch this in a different manner and help him out
hers is centered around food when she is hungry nothing sounds good so that makes her angry odd perhaps the holiday stress is getting to me
no i do not want to get locked in a psych ward what i want is to havd someone to talk to and not hold back i am sick of lying and saying i am not having suicidal thoughts i want to be truthful but i do not want to be put in a ward
but wishing does not change cold hard reality well i hope she lives a good life with whoever she ends up being with
i told you no contact was really hurting me i miss my best friend so you said we can check in every few days just to make sure the others okay
even take a vacation if you have to or in my case completely move somewhere new i am glad i experienced the breakup because it taught me how to be a man
i apologised thinking i ruined a pair of friends catching up and left i never attempted suicide before so i guess i feel kind of
i can go forever without clonazepam as long as i am drinking but as soon as i try to stop drinking it feels like my body just needs clonazepam
i mentioned it to my other siblings in a group chat and none of them responded while i know they love and care for me i feel like i have no home
i am afraid that one day my emotions would take full control of me as i have done stupid things in anger it feels like one day i am going to hit my limit and break
i start to neglect myself i start to get stuck in my depression we were both struggling in life and not happy and looking to each other for happiness
i got a dog and got off the scrips after the twelfth ineffective one i try not to drink much but will still give in once a week or so
or the room is filling up with water and the doors are locked i want to keep trying but i have completely given up
i start worrying about my life am i able to have a family or not am i able to work or not
today i struggle with harm ocd and suicide ideation i have been trying to get a higher level of mental health care because the counselor i speak with on the phone is not really equipped to deal with amount of issues i have this is really only scratching the surface of the fucked up things that happened to me as a child
but now i am scared she will contact my mum again and i can not take back the aiduring lockdown i emailed a singer
i do not feel comfortable around friends or family anymore talking about emotions makes it even worse there is not anyone in the world i can feel comfortable around there is nobody that i feel i can rely on emotionally i do not want to see anybody anymore the idea of seeing my friends again seems awful to me i feel so awkward no matter where i go i just want to be invisible
i went through a breakup 6months ago and i am kind of fine now but i have been living alone without my family or friends since i meet them on occasion i do not have a lot of friends really and my family lives cross continents
i plan to do it on my 21st birthday but if get a sign that everything is going to be fine i really hope it finds me soon

this is about my ex i know there are always two sides of a story but here is mine i was not invited
loneliness is a funny thing it is so visceral to our existence look around you everyone is battling this basic human condition some know and some take a long time to acknowledge its presence even though every single human being feels loneliness and i am not alone in this drama of existence it still does not really take away the slow sinking shrunkenness that loneliness brings in its wake
we both 21 got together in september our spirits are very similar and had an incredible chemistry she told me she had some baggage mainly the death of her mother the year prior and i knew well what i was heading into but for most part everything was good for me
like i said i left christianity earlier this year which was a great thing for my mental health because my indoctrination forced me into patterns of thinking where i would feel guilty all the time for sinning and not living up to jesus standard and all this
i hate change always have and i am afraid that if i leave him i am not going to be able to find someone in time to settle down and have a family
i try to find one since 16 years old i mean they expect us to score on the top even in this fucking pandemic
grow some balls man and keep on going with your life sorry if this was harsh but i hope i helped someone
i feel terrible for wanting to be ill when others wish they were healthy guilt is usually what keeps me here

a persons lives just round about 90 years it is nothing compared to the univers he was my best friend before we dated he broke it off with me
i am trying my best to focus on myself and i am progressing however seeing her moving on so quick on social media kind of hurts especially that we were great together and we ended from external factors it is as if we left an unfinished story

i am simply just not sure what to do i want to start my life because at the end of the day that is something to look forward to but suicide ideation has been weighing on my shoulders for years and has built up to be something scary to admit to another person and clarify that it is the reason behind my lack of securing a good future career and general livelihood

but there are people who you should not tell because they might just say what are you depressed about or you just want attention but if you are depressed you have a right to want attention to it your wanting people to care is not wrong it is human
i even did a daily list about what should i do but in the daytime i forget to do them and just doing the same stuffs

she was a lovely girl who at the beginning of our relationship showed so much interested and effort but as college started to begin soon she kind of blocked herself in
i have always been the golden child and i could see how the pressure affected me i used to be in a toxic relationship with a drug user i also bounce from one eating disorder to the next but that is not the problem i can compartmentalize all these negative events and feelings i can truly accept them for what they are i do not use excuses because i am partially responsible for them

i told him i would be there for him and i wanted him to be honest with me and to talk to me
i could go on and on and on but by forcing myself to be mindful by using pomodoro timers i noticed the world outside of myself and it is not that there is birds chirping or that the traffics moving for the first time but that it is the first time in a while i have notice there is a life outside my thoughts
my dr presribed it to me for anxiety and then took me off of it cold turkey while i was still at my lowest and i physically could not tolerate the anxiety without something numbing it out a little bit

i really needed to get my feelings out because i have been feeling increasingly worse any advice is really appreciatedi am just working my job is the satisfaction of other people the service of other people
i am so happy that i joined reddit about two months ago i have noticed that my loneliness has significantly decreased since making an account and actively using it i got to meet and chat up likely minded people and discuss whatever topic interests me i feel like having people i can talk to who have similar interests really helps with reducing loneliness

i thought that what was missing in my life was other people i do not want to be there again but no one will help me it is not fair
whatever i picked up nothing would bring me joy any kind of good or at least occupation i would be like that for the whole winter
i know the right thing to do is to give him space so he will have a chance to feel himself and his emotions at least give him a chance to miss me
i mean now after months that i think about it i see how i let some things slide away and how it was sometimes verbal abuse
and i have not packed yet if this is how it is startingexactly how it always has beforei am so worried of the damage this week could have on all the progress i have made

their friendship ended because they over stepped their boundaries as friends and were talking badly about the both of us after he denied having intercourse with one of them

i also have to rent a vehicle to pick up my mum who needs to go to her cancer treatment in the city as she is in a small town trying to sell a house that had been a plague to our family
i sometimes feel like i am losing my mind it is driving me up the wall and i want it to go away
we stayed like that for another 2 years when a guy finally came and helped us with work he was chill but uninterested so i could never find how to talk with him
i have 3 friends that i only play online games with and another 3 that i sometimes meet to go to the movies or comicstore
i felt her slipping and then one night in january 31st she just never came home this time however i started having those same experiences except without the fever
i can not take that i already have that voice in my head and hearing that from outside is just validation to my thoughts
my relation with girls have also always been kind of chaotic i only had one two years relationship i am 32 we stopped dating like 3 years ago i have been alone since
prison changed me but i gave that girl all that i knew how to give and then somekeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide
i am a monster and i need to rid this world of my filth seriously this is my third attempt this week wtf why is it taking so long
that was not the first ending i got so at least that is good right i can not keep doing this it is fucking killing me inside
i genuinely do not know if i want to die but i do i am not making much sense i feel bitter sweet i feel kind of scared and happy for some reason i am shaking a lot
it started building up since i got older and in college i also was hoping today somebody would call me and chat but no such thing happened
if hell is real i am totally goingi am about to graduate college and my whole college life was just stressing about studies grades internships etc
it has happened several times again but tonight was the last straw i was laying in my bed and had the door open showing my dimly lit hallway
after 12 weeks she did contact me and said that she have time to talk tomorrow from time to time what should i say
sure he did not give me butterflies or the spark and sure we had hardly anything in common interestswise and sure he wants kids but i do not but he fit just about every other important criteria for my partner
and you have to learn that things like this happen all the time no breakup is more special than another because everyone has been through it all
i have spent countless nights beating myself up not because i am sorry for myself because i really want to fix these for me but i also want her to be the one to reap the benefits of the new and improved me
hello everyone and please excuse my english as it is not my first language lately i have been feeling strange everything in my life is going and it has been going perfectly for years
i am not particularly depressed or anything if i could i would like to live but i have assessed the situation countless times and these are my only options left now
he even got a new ipad my mom got her self a new mac book and an iphone 12the worst thing about denial is that it does not feel like denial you just do not think about it
i guess you guys understand now what the situation is i have a huge exam in the next 3 months and i just can not stop thinking about her
then it hits me and that is when the feeling of emptiness creeps in someone who deserves to exist but i was born and i do not even think i should exist
i think where i am going with this is that if you are going through something rough and you feel like you have lost half of you it does not mean that you have to blame yourself or lose all of you in the process just know that it is not your fault and they are the ones who have lost something great
fuck i hate it i hate how they manage to love me so much because i am not worth a fraction of a percentage of the love they give me i wanted to kill myself i still do i wish i was a better son to my parents because they are really the best they love me with every fibre of their being and still there is more love
long story short my best friend committed suicide and it led to the worst year of my life my life has been awful both because of that and because of university related things i feel stuck with no will to live a life where everything seems too hard and pointless
recruiters suck and they make me want to stab myself in the chest directly through the heart these people suck they are terrible people with terrible jobs consistently fucking people over the shitty part is nothing will change i fucking hate you recruiters you all can go suck a horse dick and choke douchebags
there is one time where i did a trial experiment and not start a conversation with anyone for a month and that whole month i have not gotten a single text and that was really heart breaking for me to the point i almost commited suicide
i love her with all my heart and gave her everything even when i felt i should not have maybe one day i will reach out to her maybe not if she really wants me or wants me in her life i am going to have to let her reach out because i know if i reach out it is only going to hurt me more
i know i might be too old for needing attention but she never did she does not know shit about me even tho i keep on telling her my things my plans my dreams
showering brushing my teeth and flossing daily i started cleaning my face better and moisturizing i have a healthy glow that helps me feel confident
i 17f have been dealing with this strange issue for as long as i can remember i have been trying to find answers on the internet but no one seems to understand what i mean
at the door is her ex from her high school clearly upset about something her father came behind me telling him to leave or he would be escorted off the property military familydad
i left and got me thinking why would he stay with her talking at 12am and was really worried i feel numb and this is i think why i can not function
it happened while i basically could not do anything could not send him a death stare provoke threaten or even punch him right in the face balls or teeth out of anger or jealousy if necessary
i just can not help but feel like it will never happen for me has anyone ever gotten over feeling this type of loneliness i am sure there are people out there
i loved her with all my heart i was not confident enough but she help me through it maybe it is only because she is busy i have no idea how she is feeling
but these things are not actually caused by anything physical it is the sheer weight of my crushing emotional pain that causes it
but then if i continue to try to nap it will make me super anxious and then on the verge of a panic attack that will make me have to get up instantly
she also said she wants someone who would make sure she goes to church every weekend before her i was never really religious
i know this is a bad idea no one here is an expert but before i go to a therapist and ruin my life yet save it i need to know if i am crazy
i left my parents house both time studying and moved to another city both times moving back to my parents later on
recently i have been thinking about becoming a game designer like after civil i would do march and then get into the gaming industry
i feel like a completely different person in my own body and i do not even know how to exist on my own and it hurts so bad
my mental health was at its worst a few years ago and its gotten better but at the time i really struggled with anxiety and depression
this exercises whole premise is to help you understand how small you are which is a good thing and how insignificant the heartbreak you are going through truly is compared to the grand scheme of things
the fear that i had of us becoming distant has become a reality now and now i am the one who wants the relationship not him
i wish i could still be there for you but i can not and you have no one else to blame but youself for that
i have been thinking about taking my life for 7 years now i think it is time i have been through a lot in my life as you know and i am going to get through time
i feel like everyone is out to get me i feel like everyone is judging me or staring at me or talking about me
unfortunately it will probably be a while i would feel bad writing that except i am pretty sure they want out of here as well
my parents are super fucked up emotionally and mentally but they are my biggest financial support for my son and i without them i am not sure i would be lucky enough to have custody of the one thing that keeps me here
i do have a wellpaid job lined up after college now but i feel i missed out on the typical college fun experiences as i was vested in my studies
christmas reminds me of how completely alone i am my boyfriend did not even include me in his familys christmas and we have been together for 3 years my family is broken and i am extremely depressed i do not see the point in continuing anymore
i do not know it feels like it should not be like this after so long and it usually is not i would like to think i am rather happy go lucky normally but lately this has been creeping into my mind really nagging at it maybe it is because my other friends are happy with their partners and it make me subtly jealous or long for what i once had who knows worlds weird i suppose
i felt the trembles coming so i asked my mom if i could sleep in bed with hercovid really put pressure on our relationship so we were constantly fighting
life save hospitalhttpswwwlifesavehospitalcom is one of the oldest and best rehab centers and mental health treatment in bangladeshhttpswwwlifesavehospitalcom life save hospital provided the very best accommodation healthy food 24 hours doctor facilities for patients they provided services for 24 hours in 365 days
i am terrified that i will go crazy without friends and become something that i have feared the most there is no reciprocation i feel so stupid
tldr i can not message people without feeling like i am interrupting or like i am in the way this has lead to my friend group dropping to only 3 people who i only meet to play dd
just joined reddit because you guys litterally have the advice to anyhring and this question has been bothering more and more this past year and i am just concerned for my dad so basically me 18m and my dad 52 have been quite distant for some years starting back in 2012 when after many years of being super complacent lazy and quite often drunk my mom decided to divorce him
i am only going to try overdose enough to get me hospitalized because no one will bat an eye at me andor give a shit about my mental health unless i kill myself school is stressful having so many responsibilities is stressful and just being alive makes me want to die
focus on yourself let time heal your wounds and take your mind off of himher even take a vacation if you have to or in my case completely move somewhere new
if i could live in this imaginary world with rainbows and unicorns where good guys always win and where everyone gets what they deserve
physically my health is up and down comfort eating was a big thing for me so i am usually a bit overweight but the weight is coming down now the way i look is not really up to muchi have always joked that i am too ugly to be attractive but not ugly enough to be interesting hehe my skin is awful unfortunately
i am sorry for my english and i hope someone can give me an answer also can you suggest your therapist that you think you have a certain disorder
i played along and made the whole thing seem mutual we where together for 5 years and he proposed to me on my birthday
they did not offer much using cbt techniques tends to make me feel a lot worse actuallyimagine the screams after seeing someone is brain matter all over the place haha that will traumatize them
i do well some days but other days like today l just feel devastated guilty if l had not lied to him he would still be with me
i am feeling sad and hopeless it seems like whenever i scroll through so many posts many people keep saying it is been 11 months and i still think about them or it is been a year
i guess this is just fueled by the desire to never feel as alone as i felt before i met him and the presumption that without him i would be depressed and lonely forever i do not know i guess i am just reaching out to see if anyone has felt this before and what they did to start caring about everything else that life has to offer because if he left i would be seriously fucked
i am deathly scared of the hospital and i was just wondering what the actually process is when you check yourself in for mental illness are there needles involved am i able to just talk to someone there or am i forced to stay
the goal is always to provide all help with the clients full knowledge and informed consent we know that no individual or system is perfect
he slammed his computer mouse and broke it yelling at me told me i had to leave and take everything i had there or he would chuck it i had a good few christmas gifts i was storing there few different bags and whatnot it was after midnight and i am drunk in a sketchy neighbourhood known for stabbings and mugging and whatnot he tells me to start walking anyway no care
i got a major boost of happiness from a holiday stream from my favorite streamer on christmas eve as well as a a bunch of other factors and because yesterday was christmas in general
i have been so lonely for the past 4ish months i at least want to post about my life before i end it all
at some point she starts slamming the hair cutting machine into head at the moment we thought we were going to be murdered
it was never perfect my parents were physically abusive towards my brother and i could do nothing but watch and be scared of misbehaving
with the promise being that from that point onwards i would be putting 100 of my effort into improving and being a better person because i wanted to do it for myself but more importantly i wanted to do it for her and so i could make her happy
now here is where it gets really interesting at work it became really obvious that they were having problems he would walk out of rooms she entered he would greet everyone but her and was being generally unpleasant on many occasions she tried to apologise for their fight but he just blocked her on everything
i am just feeling really crazy like i am never alone someone is always watching me and everything i doi keep repeating it to myself i am going to kill myself
the bipolar 2 mediation scared the living daylights out of me because my libido completely disappeared i could not feel a single thing down there i stopped taking it the 3rd day of being prescribed
we have been together for 2 years i can not explain how amazing he is to me but we tend to have arguments because of me
i also feel like i can not tell anyone how i feel cus it puts any unnecessary burden on them because they should not have to help solve my problems
but everything i get this urge to just sleep and not wake up and i am battling with my life is so boring i have never dated drank or done nothing
anyways sometimes the loneliness gets so bad all i can do i lie down and wait for it to go away or try to carry it
we laughed a lot which was great and there was no hostility whatsoever but it is heartbreaking to know the experience of being with her is over
i never realized i was pushing him away to this extent until he told me this during the breakup i have tried texting and everytime he just says please stop
the feeling of not being wanted and not being shown any affection nor interest surely created that fear of rejection and of intimacy
she said a lot i will not say everything she said and to be fair what she said makes sense it is just difficult because i never wanted to lose her i could see her in my future i wanted to make plans with her
when people say they like and care about you they are lying to you even if they think what they are saying is true
i do not know what i am trying to say all i know is that emotionally i am completely wrecked people say you can not plan your life out and i never thought it was true because i had planed my life around being the perfect girlfriend
long i can keep going i hate fucking everything i have nothing to live for i am worthless as fuck i really am i feel like i treat everyone like shit because of my own personal problems and i can not stop i am
reading stories seeing or hearing or just noticing how people form cool relationships have all these awesome and fun experiences live and interact with others frequently having fun adventures and all that stuff it feels like something was vacuuming out my internals
it was a pic of her graduation from nursing program from cc including her new man it was 2 years long those years she spent bettering herself and i nothing
i have almost reached the milestone of a year into my relationship and i honestly do not want it to last too much longer
have you ever been in a group of people who you literally had nothing in common with i would sit there and pretend to care about things i had no idea about
how many of you here are also worried that when you are finally in a relationship you will be way to clingy suffocating or become codependent as a result of being alone for so long
i prefer to open up a discussion if possible about loneliness being treated like a mental disorder funny enough she has never allowed me to find a job or even try for my drivers permit
i usually listen to music when i work but lately i have just gravitated to listening to podcast in foreign languages which i do not understand
i could remember just holding her in my arms and reassuring her things were going to be better because she was still hurt talking about it
anyways i have always had a strange gut feeling about him he hates my cat my cat so far has only liked people with good intentions and told me he can not bond with animals which i found weird
i cleaned myself up and put antibiotic ointment on the injuries but i feel absolutely disgusting am i that weak am i that weak that i can not stop myself from doing that to myself i put the blade up to my neck and that is when i stopped i found myself staring at the ceiling zoning out and that is when i put the blade down and stopped
but in this moment i was in a dark place with pornography and i have always wanted to know what it would to get a blowjob
i always gave love but never get any back early november he had been trying to get ahold of me but i had no phone service or internet

i am not really sure what to do i want to get medicated and i want to see a therapist but i do not want to tell my parents what is happened because i still think i am better than i was before
i have also recently started a part time courseunfortunately this feeling is familiar but it is gotten worse probably because i have gotten older and more things have happened
i no longer fear being alone except from being without blanc if my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blanc cannot become real so be it i swear by the salvation after death i will be alone for the rest of all the eternities
tldr my gf broke up with me or we are taking a long break yesterday and now i can not stop thinking of all the things i can not do or say anymore also crying into my sweatshirt that smells like her i really miss her
i feel i am treated lesser than everyone else here now like i am some china wear that they have to treat carefully or i will break
i do not want you to say something like there is still hope and your family loves you i want you to tell me the truth
my parents raised me better than that but she would bring the anger out of methese days i get this once in a while without cbd use
i just want to feel wanted to feel whatever you are supposed to feel when people actually give a damn about your existence
i have dealt with racism the area i live and only ever trusted a few people my boyfriend and best friend supported me to see a therapist because i just was not in good shape
i feel like i have given up and i am becoming bitter or even evil i do not want to freaking pay for sex i just want to be acknowledged
this was a great relationship but it was not a this is the love of my life relationship maybe we just were not there yet maybe we were never going to get there but what if we were
i do not give a ruck about the gifts christmas spirit or whatever i am just tired of everything it is almost fucking christmas yet i am contemplating killing myself i just want the pain to stop
and he did not even think it was rude anyway he told me that if i wanted him to change i should just go get someone else
like i do not want to be seen as some sort of weak person for asking for help or telling anyone and i am not sure what to do how or to discuss it with anyone
no matter where i am or who i am with i feel the profound emptiness that i can never erase i guess what i have does that to you but still does not get easier with time or therapy
i just really like her and am really bad with hearthbreaks i keep going in circles and having the same thoughts over and over again
however i have probably tossed away future relationship potentials because i see certain things as red flags or feel like i am dodging bullets out of what turn out to be toy guns
would not it be exactly the same staying with another old person who we do not even talk to anymore maybe well be pissed off on each other staying together just because of we are used to it no hugs no excitement together no positive energy exchange
i know this whole situation was pathetic and i feel embarrassed that i actually let it go this far and that it was not even a real relationship but whatever i keep telling myself i still feel depressed that she is gone
i want to hold someone and know that they actually love me like i do them nobody gets why i can not live normally
fuck my life and propensity to choose the wrong partners at least now i will do it in style with my new flashy name and the haircut i got yesterday
i am aware i am in the wrong but i am just so tired i can finally go i used to be scared of dying but now i am free to do whatever i want nobody cares about me anymore nobody is going to hide me under their wings until i regain my energy its really the end and that is okay all of that is ok i wanted to die for quite sometime
and i am not talking about believing you are so worthy that you deserve the world fuck that i am talking about a more realistic sense of worth one that goes like this i am probably better than spending all my time chasing after someone who obviously does not want my presence or attention
here is some sobering advice save those skills for when you are actually in a relationship they have no place in getting your ex back
my mother chose the man who molested me for 3 years over me and they are still going strong yet i can not keep a relationship
i asked for favors and god gave me opportunities i received nothing i wanted i received everything i needed has anyone else been through this will i ever fall in love again
nobody even knew about it and i did not tell anyone because it would just be awkward and forced and fuck that that is even worse
so my ex and started dating around september 2015 and we broke up last year we were each others first love and had a great time together
i mean i was not completely depressed i just found it hard to keep it on pair with the standards i had and wanted to achieve
i have confronted him in the past but the yelling blaming and defensiveness just proves my point i feel in a way
i have always had a deep loneliness in me and my 18 month relationship broke down 6 weeks ago in lockdown due to me being on auto pilot and not takin interest in anything an struggling so much but keeping it on a low an now she is gone i feel like i have nothing
but then on the other hand i just can not shake it off as a coincidence it was too weird to be a coincidence
wish i had my debit card to order the shit onlinei have prime so it would only be 23 days until i died if i had antifreeze
ok so every few months i used to have really bad breakdowns i kind of come from a family where men do not cry and that sort of stuff
to that degree it becomes harder to disconnect for example if you are physically connected to someone it may be easier to move on from them
stuck at one placewaking up every morning and not able to do something productive is what i am going through which led me to overthink about things i can not have or try fear where i might end up in a few years whether i will find somebody or end up alonethe mind wanders right
the only thing i regret was making it out when i hear all these stories of people surviving they always say they immediately regretted it
i felt safe calm and secure again i was getting into talking to friends working on myself doing things i enjoyed
even my black friend from college thinks i have failed her as a friend and as an advocate for the black community
i just can not stop paying attention to it and now i also can not eat well bc every time i am afraid of choking on food
my girlfriend broke up with me nearly a month ago and it is been really difficult for me to deal with as i love her with everything in my heart
i just broke up a couple of days ago and since then my life has been really strange initially i accepted that i needed to move on for a brief time i even felt fine with it
everyday i am getting closer to killing myself i can not live on a planet where my best bro is yknow but i also wanted to mention something that is totally weird and crazy and it is pissing me off so much the afterlife i was never really interested in religion but my mom is a full on christian
i do not know if this fits but i have nothing else to do and i need to organize everything and write it all down
i have good days and i have bad ones but each of them with the same thought i am diagnosed with depression ptsd anxiety
i feel very lonely i want to hang out with people i miss the feeling of having friends i am sick of staying home in weekends or going out with family
i would do this to cut off any negative train of thoughts any chain of negative emotions and thoughts i will actively play my favorite song to drown out the thoughts
that is fine if you need to do that but i am trying to say is that when you get closer to what went wrong you get closer to the problems when you get closer to the mistakes you get so much more awareness
welp woke up and hoped to have a good christmas day but once agian i am sitting here fucking stressed and depressed af
some of her last words were that day i am not going to be looking to be in another relationship for a long time
after kingsday i received a message from him he wanted to get into contact again he told me that he moved out and that he would like to show me his new place
but i love him and i do not want to lose him would it be better to let him go i hate that
i know that a lot of people go through things worse than anything i have ever been through it was not a dealbreaker in our relationship
and you will regret it if you act like a fool but thinking about it helps but do not act on it
i 18f suddenly cried in front of my family while we were eating lunch today 24th of december i ran in to the bathroom to cry and did not allow anyone to come in
everyone goes through these disturbing emotions at some point in their life yet some people stay stuck within their tight and cold and vicious grasp and somehow can not lessen it no matter how hard they fight
pls tell me you do not i have not reached out and have been ignoring his activities online but after a week and 3 days since last contact he replies to my story so casually i did not ignore completely cuz i did not want to seem bitter or anything but is that wrong i do not want him back either tbh just want him to regret and miss me but ig this is not it either hahahaha
it is been 6 months since she officially ended it not friendship not relationship and then i think we will it is kind of true
i do have the flashbacks and what not but that is not the worst of it flashbacks only last minutes compared to that overwhelming feeling of watching your 6 and protecting your loved ones
i did not look at him and see a future i looked at him and i saw him slowly slip away from me
i have got not much left only a few mutual friends in the neighborhood who i see occasionally i come to the realization that i can not really go on with life without her
i am also no longer in the top maths class and my parents keep bringing up the fact that i was demoted even though i am pretty happy in the lower but still second top class
it is been almost a month i barely talk to you but i see you everyday but i guess that is a little gist of it that i could put into words
we would rather live in a world where we get what we do not deserve but we know that we are going to get it
so i am thinking this is great at least you told me but i am also in the middle of crying this was all over text so then i am like let us go no contact for a few days besides our snap streak
i did everything that i possibly could to make you happy and to love me and better yourself as a person and a lover and a girlfriend
i do have friends that will occasionally ask me to hang out with them and we all have fun and such
it feels like 100 pounds on my chest it feels like nothing will ever be ok ever againi feel so fucking trapped and hopeless i opened up and have gone to therapy
i do not get people i do not know who i am myself i feel like i am having mental breakdowns for weeks on end
i have grown up mentally since my last relationship and i am over crying about being alone as i realised being alone is not my only problem i accepted it and started seeking the right path through my life
went on holidays or whatever you want to call them cos of covid but we went to places and made so many memories
i was highly motivated to do well get good grades do my homework etc now i am in university and things are a lot like they were when i was a kid again
i feel like giving in but i will be miserable if i cut off my dad it is a no win situation
also i hope this is the right sub reddit for this sort of stuff if it is not could someone tell me a more suitable one
i understand that it is not a bad thing but i do not really like doing ithi i am 20 and tonight i feel that i do not have a purpose in life
either ways back to the hand holding hugs and kisses i asked her what they mean to her and she says those are actions done to show that you missed someone she had just broke down in tears yesterday telling me how much she misses me but does not do any of those actions
i feel like i am sometimes not be wanted how can i love myself enough to keep going as you an imagine i was panicking right there but i played it cool
i wonder if there is any way to really fix it or it will be like this for the rest of my life
they expect favors from you they expect your protection of themphysically even though they would not be on your side of a simple argument even if you are in the right there are cops that get paid for this you can hire a bodyguard i am not free protection my life is not yours i would rather die than be your slave
not just because i am alone but nobody in my life knows what is up with me i talk a lot of shit about and make myself seem confident but i am not
idk if it is because people view me as a person who they expect to invite them to hangout but when i do they usually can not
the very next morning she called me crying and begging for me back i was sad but i did just that
we decided to contact lisa the girl who was supposedly his best friend to tell her about all the shit that was going around
i have no motivation to live anymore and my current situation does not help at all because i have been dealing with so much bullshit for such a long time now and i honestly do not feel like trying anymore i do not have the energy anymore and truly feel like id be better if i committed but we have been long distance girlfriends for over 8 years now and all i have ever dreamed about was to have a future with her
maybe its just not in the cards for me to have friends i am tired of going out of my way to find them and get 0 in return why can not you just message me once why can not you drive a conversation instead of me i am introverted too i am just trying my best for you
i have strained the relationships with my parents and part girl friends but i never worked quite this hard for someone to have it blow up in my face
i am lost for things to do i am out of energy i have feared his death my entire life but this is a slower burn i am watching the most important person in my life slowly deteriorate mentally
ever since it is been working out great for me i took that into my love life too i have a very low selfesteem because of how skinny i am i always worked hard on keeping up a proud face in any given situation
i try to eat it reminds me of heri try to drink water it is her voice in my head asking if i am hydrated
we were serious put an offer in on a house was looking for a place he lost his job due to covid decided to move home and work for his brother
my name is rogério bordini and i am a phd student at the offenburg university germany currently i am working as a researcher and designer at the affective cognitive institute httpsaffectivelaborghttpsaffectivelaborg
i really just do not have an answer and contemplate suicide on a regular basis its gotten to the point where i even made a plan with time method and location
feel free to pm me as well if you are struggling i would love to talk and help out i know how miserable this can be
it hurts so much to think that i will never experience that or have her back again please enjoy the time with your families you do not know how long it will last
they only love you when you do what they want or reach their high expectations they have these standards for me that i never even fucking asked for
i find it hard to get up in the morning nowadays and deal with the flashbacks and on top of that i am still trying to get over heartbreak
and now here i am i left our friend group we had but am hoping to remain good friends so i started to find more friends but the thing is
38 autistic female so no friends because i am a fucking weirdo before that we had gotten into a fight and did not talk for about 2 days
you overthink even when you have a ton of people around you i vaguely remember being woken up by the sound of my own voice yelling
i 18m keep getting these dreams that seem to last for days at some point where i meet a girl and we develop a relationship
i quit drinking and have been living a more active healthier lifestyle thinking that would help but it has not i have forgotten how it feels to be wanted or desired
i am receiving help for major depression disorder mdd and a few other things it is not helpful i feel as though i can not truly tell my therapist how i feel without being hospitalized
anything helps advice experiencesstories of your own your coping mechanisms for griefextreme stress whatever you would like to add and do not be scared to ask something if i do not want to answer it i just will not
everytime i get a message or phone call from my family i get extremely anxious and prepare for the worst it is been very traumatic
so i go home all mighty and proud of myself at the time it was just me and my dad already we had a guinea pig
i have been furloughed from work and at this rate it does not look like i am going back i have tried talking to my family about what i am going through and nobody understands and just brushes me off i have gained a ton of weight and do not look remotely close to how i use to when i felt like people could at least look at me without gagging
things were getting better again and then out of no where she sends me a long paragraph about how she does not want to actually be with me and never really saw me in her future
things were rocky up and down we were both going through a lot of shit recently but the way we ended was so abrupt
an incident i still remember is when i forgot to do my laundry one day and she threw detergent water at my face
memories of happier times seem to keep flooding back and it makes me forget that we broke up for a reason
she is his crush back then when we were dating he cheated on me with her and i was forgive him what a shame
to clarify i have no intention or urge to betray my wife in return i shared as well but i feel like it drove a wedge
eventually i became very peaceful though and just write explanations about why i dumped her and so on every single day i write messages to her delete them again write them again
she said to me if it is so hard now how hard will it be when you move there and get a regular job there
no contact started yesterday never done this with an ex before but i have never tried to be friends with an ex before
she was also done with us she had been for weeks and the only reason we stayed together was because she was pregnant
what is your secret to moving on when you just want to run back and make it workwhen did the important question become why we should help them instead of what can help them
virgins and niceguys love to shit on women that are just living life to the fullest and doing what they want with their body but just because they are not doing those things with them they get frustrated and vent their anger and insecurities towards these women
i hope if someone reads thisthey can maybe see somebody who got to what they thought was the worse part of their lifethought that there was no point in going on livingand was still able to get to where i could be happyand deal with things that would have destroyed me years ago
we had so many plans we were supposed to move in together in a year i was supposed to spend the christmas with her and her family for the first time
anyway the acquittance was in blank so i had to filled it but i think i am the only single person out of my siblings i have no children
i do not have rat poisoning or a gun or any pills that will help so wtf do i do ugh i hate it here i wish to die in my sleep
from march to the middle of may i would been in the process of working towards a promotion as a shift assistant at a local amazon warehouse
my gf just broke up with me for her own reasons she was all i have when we broke i could not find anyone to talk with i realized that i was absolutely alone and i tried to move on feeling that the whole world against me are there any suggestions how to get out of this situation and get a healthy life
i am exhausted of not being able to control my cynicism i am tired of finding ways to be dissappointed at the world instead of happy
both of them are beautiful and tall and skinny they just casually talk about their weight and their boyfriends and girlfriends and it makes me so mad
but on saturday night she told me she was thinking to come back definitely in france to live closer to her parents we spoke a lot on the night and on sunday morning but she called her sister and took a one way plane ticket to france for this friday like that end of the story
when i try to stop them more and more come it is like my brain is sabotaging myself i tried medication no luck
i want to die so bad i am a waste of space and have no reason to be here a pathetic daughter an embarrassment to the family and an awfully broken friend i have been slowly cutting off ppl and i do not know why i am doing this just want to be alone and isolated it would probably be for the best if people forgot about me
i created a new account with a different name and she messaged me there too i have never replied to any of her messages and do not intend to
no matter what you build up in love in life in your friends it ends bit by bit everything you have built slipping from your hands before your eyes and i just do not get the point of sticking around
i worry about my future myself health money and sometimes i am anxious and afraid for no reason i have bad health anxiety because i am often sick
also i have never realized how much i enjoy christmas music until this year so i guess i learned something new about myself
i just walk out of the sessions empty unchanging so now this strange selfpity as evolved into empathy i feel for others
and the girls in the dreams are never the same and it has not been anyone i recognized until today the girl was what you could call a tiktok crush
i am a 22 years old male i love my job that is software development recently i found out that i am quite interested in boxing so i try to visit the boxing classes 23 times per week also i spend my time playing the mobile legends and watching different tvseries
those bastards knew about the issues i had i would say how them denying this is dishonest but they do not have principles in the first place
now it is winter break and i do not have school so i am extremely bored all day or needing to take care of family
see a therapist my therapist showed me how selfish he was how he betrayed me repeatedly and how i deserve better
i became a fucking monster and i know things would be different if i never came out i wish i was able to transition from when i first felt puberty
i have been trying to get skinnier because i hate my weight and maybe if i lost more weight i would actually not get rejected i am not overweight or anything but i want to be skinny i am developing feelings for another guy and i think i have a better chance with him but fantasizing about being with him makes me feel horrible because what if he just rejects me like my friend did
see you later stranger now i am gonma bet on when the next episode of when i do the hard drug of suicide phantasies comes out
i mean i takes a sec to feel like them feeling their face as myyselfi am cheking like i looking in one guys eyes
i just wish i could play games or listen to music or go out without thinking of him everything reminds me of him
but to the point if he breaks up with me i think i will kill myself it is just i do not think i could ever live with the pain of knowing i hurt the only person i have ever truly cared about to the point where they do not forgive me anymore
all i know is i need a new way to stop these thoughtsany advice for people who have been there to what it is like
it kind of hurts looking at anyone with someone they can love and having to tell yourself you will never have that and it is all your fault
hey so i do this thing that is pretty weirdi think this is to cope with my crushing depression anxiety etc
for info she is 18 i am 19 about to turn 20 and we go to college together relationship was only two months old but with covid we have both spent a lot of time with each othera families and the relationship moved rather quickly i fear that may have made it worse
i do not usually feel this feeling when i have a female in my life and i feel like i am always desperately seeking female attention and validation which ruins all of my relationships
as i had high expectations of myself high academic pressure and much other stuff a week before final exams i felt i could not breath and emotionally unstable but i tried to bounce back multiple times
they say universitys the time in your life where you make everlasting friendships and relationships what a fucking lie too late to try now since everybodys found their own circles and i do not fit in any of them
my lot been assigned my abilities to alter existence cleari still fear what impact my suicide may have in my family on my mother
i was shaking and on the verge of tears this time when she asked what was wrong out of no where i freaking lied
seven months later his friends tell my boyfriend and claim that they felt guilty and that i was the one asking to do anything about it
it hurts a lot to see someone you used to talk to a lot just stop talking to you all of a sudden
looked at my watch and it had been two hours i do not want to be there again but no one will help me
i asked her if we can go back to dating and set boundaries because i feel that perhaps we can meet halfway with her decision if she is not ready to commit
i feel like once he moves i will be able to move on he will be gone to a new place living a completely new life without me
i am in college and taking this semester off because i got really burnt out the end of this previous semester i think that is a good idea i am working full time which is great and i love my job my coworkers are my best friends have not really been able to work this week though
i want to live my life but i do not want to do it alone every night i crawl into bed a bed meant for two in it is size every time that i am not actively feeling lonely if i happen look over to the large empty space next to me at night i can not help but feel it come rushing back
i am young and i need help i am too shy to open up here please meassge me in dms2020 has been hell for me losts jobs loved ones and sides of myself i want back
it also does not help that my sister at 25 just finished her education and is looking for a decently paid job because of her high grades
not just a year or two but mostly my whole life the ones i really loved are gone or left me
i ran for over an hour yesterday to try an avoid crying but now i can not even focus i feel like this would be easier if there was a better explanation i wish i understood what was happening i feel cursed to be alone there is a family rumor on my moms side that all the women are cursed to never wed and it just seems more and more real
at the end of july one of my uncles was in a really bad car accident he had a seizure while driving on the highway crossed the median and hit another car headon

i will be turning 29 on tuesday if i make that long and i hate myselfi am stupid have zero talent and am just a waste of resources
because my girlfriend would make me forget how time passed but but like i said i do not have a girlfriend omg i will die alone
there is this expectation that today is perfect and everyone is so so happy but i am not happy and that sucks but merry christmas everyone i guess
he was an awful bf but of course and had bouts of anger would insult and ridicule me and was an extremely difficult person
and i want that for him but i also want to be selfish and have one last hug maybe even one last kiss
they told me she would not be alive if it were not for me and thanked me i am letting down every one who actually believes in me i cry uncontrollably
maybe you are feeling an unpleasant feeling but using the word broken is so much heavier than saying i have an
i looked this up and the term avolition came up as a symptom of schizophrenia i was diagnosed with bpd and ocd years ago and depressionanxiety as symptoms of these but that is it
i do not want pity i am a fuck tard i just want to kno if others feel like i doi just do not get it why do people be so fake and use someone like this
after that ended i felt relieved at first only to slowly start feeling worse as the months passed and i graduated from high school which is when i lost any motivation to do anything at all for some reason
i do not enjoy being alive anymore i wish i knew what it feels like to be happy or surrounded by people who cares
we have this bad habit of making something our everything and then we put all of our confidence into our relationship
in the end everyone leaves me and i am the only one feeling hurt nobody needs me in their lives nobody cares
i feel trapped tho if i am honest i do not really have anywhere i can move to if i left them and it is difficult finding other rented accomodation because i have a dog and a lot of landlords do not allow pets specially in the cheaper places
in september i had a kind of realization that i am not that deeply involved in anybodys life and i do not care that much about other people which led to my concern about having a personality disorder andor early signs of schizophrenia which my therapist said was my anxiety since i do not actually display any psychotic symptoms but i feel like i will when i am at the average age of onset
now that she is getting older her seizures are getting worse she is becoming more delayed and i just honestly hate saying i do not want to do it anymore
and for financial reasons still in the home we shared as a family and i am not doing so well specifically on the weeks when my daughter is not here
i was making progress psychologically and learning how to train my mind then the pandemic hit since then i lost a lot of my support systems due to death lack of communication or the like
i do not know if i should post this to self or suicidewatch i am going with sw because i think its more related to it idk
the main thing though is the anger and the agitation i feel like i am unhinged and need to be careful with myself
in case you are reading this which i know you are not just know i still do not know what to do what to say what to feel you fucked me up but i still miss you
then with time we kind of isolated ourselves friends moved to different cities i did not make new ones but it was ok because i had my boyfriend who was my best friend
that is it all that for nothing did you ever love me like you said you are such a fucking idiot you lost the best thing that has ever happened to you
i feel like i have tried so hard to work out of depression and i feel so much shame that what works for others is not working for me i have tried a bunch of medications therapies and other avenues i feel broken and like i am the only one that struggles to see results how do you manage all of it
are there any other ways i can not live in a way where i have to work go home sleep work again i just want to die
she cried to me and said she wants things to work in the future but she is definitely self sabotaging right now and everyone can see it
were the the happy and good times we were experiencing together that whole year a lie why would she lie how many of her kisses were fake her hugs her cute demands for affection our laughter our sex us holding each other in bed and being happy we were not spending it alone how much of it was all a farce to keep me there helping her with bills
he ended things back in september caught him talking to other women and stated it is not cheating if he did not plan on seeing them and it would not be cheating if our relationship was about to endneeded distraction from the stress we were having
i am in my late 20s and have had major depression for over a decadehi everyone hope you are all feeling well and healthy
so my boyfriend and i were together for about a year we started out long distance when we first met which was not too bad
i would be just walking on the street and i look at someone and i have a sudden feeling of slashing them with a knife
they did many tests and i saw almost all specialists i have hypothyroidism which may because fatigue but i do not think it is the because for other symptoms
i went through a very very dark time for almost 2 months where i was crying my self to sleep every night and breaking down multiple times a day
we had a child together that we lost i asked him if he would ever want me back and he said he does not know
since then it was my favourite band damn i was always scared of mantra and faaip de oiad at that age and helped me alot trough various stages of my life
this being forward moving out to start a new chapter of our lives so we can save to have our own house where we can do what we want forever
oh how i long for something sincere how i feel my heart break as i imagine something beautiful and wish i could have it but the reality hits out like thunder
lost my last friend today i feel there is not a place for me in the world i do not deserve friends because i am not interesting neither i have the social skills i also feel suicidal today
i wanted you to feel that all you did was not in vain i made myself responsible and give you the chance to ask anything
4 trying to find some gf similar in religion similar in thoughts 5 am too intelligent hence its difficult to connect and am picky about my friend or prospective girlfriend choices
i have my custombuilt workstation that i use for particle simulations my custom trail bike i am building a family albeit its falling apart but i just want to fill that hole in my chest
i feel desperate for any feeling that is a distraction from the constant cycle i want to die already fuck everything feels so blurry
after opening up about my loneliness on monday i feel like pure rubbish now i feel stupid for thinking this was a genuine person who actually cared about how i am feeling
so familiar pain is like i am with this person they because me pain but it is the kind of pain i know
so say if the first few months of 2021 are anything like 2020 there will be no doubt as to me leaving the kitchen
kind of like i am revisiting my childhood bedroom and everything is just how i left it if that makes any sense
this has been sooooo hard for me to do because this is the most serious relationship that i have been in and never experienced the i need space talk
reading it reminded me why certain situations trigger stronger emotional responseseven if we are not conscious of all the reasons we respond to a particular situation oftentimes these responses are reflective of a lifetime of experiences and learningwe all have experiences we did not choose and not all of them were good
there were noticeable themes in which i could see how each one built on the other i think he could tell i was one of the perfect victims
is this too much to ask i just want love from them and them to be real and the question she asked me was what gave me the epiphany
while it is good advice it misses out one key part you have to be consistent and willing to show up even when you do not feel like it
ik when i am sad i push ppl alway and it is not that i am trying to be mean it is more that i feel like if i push them away i do not have to think ab it or i do not have to see ppl being happy when i am not
but i know i should not have sent that i just am so hurt i see that now it only added to my despair
i do appreciate the support people are trying to give me but they can not help my future i am not going to grow up happy
and then i tried to move on with a new guy i got blocked after a couple of days i rarely get any hugs from anybody but when i do it takes my loneliness away for that moment
i find myself to be distracted most of the time thinking about this and i am unsure what to do i have slowly been losing motivation to put in effort and she does not seem to notice
i am just a very aggressive person so i tend to yell at a lot of people i do not mean it it just happens i will write more later thank you for reading all the way through if you did
i have a school phobia and i was at school until i graduated from high school two years ago but since then i have no strength to do anything else and i feel very guilty
i will not ever focus on anything else i need to let you go so that i can live my life for me
my eating has been quite disordered recently and normally i just have something small around dinner time but today was the first time i had some breakfast since april
come on and join me i will show you a paradise in hell god why you hate me please let me go now the devil awaits me
i have gone into a relationship pretending to be the persons perfect partner only to leave them the moment i get bored or fall out of love with them
my exams will start around 5 months now and i am so fucking stressed that i can not concentrate anymore on my studies and nor on the things i like
i know i am only 20 and it could work out in the future and i am not interested in dating anytime soon but any advice for how to not think about him
every day i wake up in the morning i just lie in bed for hours on end not doing anything productive and by night time the same thing happens i just lie in bed for hours and hours thinking about life
just a bit of a rant i am trying to get back into therapy but the mental healthcare infrastructure in the united states was garbage prepandemic now it truly seems nonexistent
i have tried setting my expectations lower but if i am not attracted then i am just not attracted i think everyone desires to have someone around themselves even when they have a fulfilling work
to put it simply not too long ago a good friend of mine were in group messenger conversation brought up some things he wanted to learn how to do like learn an instrument and languages
i feel like i failed her and that i could not keep her safe i would give anything to have her back with me and to be able to hold her and hug her
i feel a deep seeded loneliness inside me when i am in a depressed and anxiety ridden state and that void is hard to be filled when i just do not feel as understood as i would like too it eats away at me every day not knowing why these feelings come on so strong during those times
the thing is for me we broke up which means we have to start breaking habits and ties to eachother to start healing but how am i supposed to do that when he is in my space acting like nothing happened
she said that she did like me but there was not enough that she would sacrifice her happiness by moving to a city where she did not feel comfortable and there could not have been a marriage where either one of us was not happy
after being told she might die thankfully the doctors said she will survive after a few surgeries then 6 weeks to heal internal injuries and broken bones what happens next
i do not really connect with the men at the barber shop or at the vape shop so those options do not really work
i knew that it was important to not let the person break me down but it is also important to validate the pain so i could begin the healing
most days i can be positive towards my situationserious question and do not give me any bullshit how do i effectively cut myself
not from a place of depression sadness anger or even trauma from a place of complete lack of the will to maintain myself
2 years we hid nothingwhen i want romantic relationships i do not want platonic relationshipswhen i want platonic relationships i do not want romantic relationships
today i did check his twitter we have been nc for a couple of days and he tweeted there is a difference between challenging someone and tearing them down
long story short i survived i told everyone that i regret doing what i did but the truth is the only thing i regret is not turning off my location i was so close
i do not know what is wrong with me but it makes me sick of living i have gotten sick of hearing people telling me how to change my life without even understanding my situation
i do not have anyone to talk to these days and i know that lots of people feel worse during this season for the same reason i hope all of you pull through this rough time so maybe a happier time can come the world acts like everyone is happy just because it is the holiday season but to me it feels like a time where more people feel alone than ever
we have to empty the water first from the cup removing the impurities and then refill it with pure water instead
or i was studying i would imagine someone a boyfriend maybe was sitting with me also studying i have grown out of it but i often think of that stage of my life
then for the rest of the time i am cold empty devoid of feeling and my voice is really monotone and i move talk and act like a robot
he was really really heart broken and begged for me to stay many times we ended on good terms and i only cut things off because of incompatibility
i am sick of everything i recently got out of an alcohol abuse and made this account to help me stay on track i almost killed myself at the beginning of last year and now those feelings are starting to resurface not only will it be a year since the darkest place of my life in less than a month but i fail to see a future for myself
does it seem like a horrible decision or am i actually doing him and i a favour is there anyone that has been in a similar situation
i love my wife but i feel that any day now i am going to get the call that she is gone and there is nothing i can do to stop that
for so many years i have held on for some reason i have yet to understand but my grasp is loostening every second i breathe
been having suicidal though for years too bitchy to do it i think i just miss my mom more than anything now
the only thing left that i know could be a possible solution is hypnosis but just like meditation hypnosis is very hard since it requires you to focus on 1 thing also i have only tried it through a video
there is nothing more to say please do not tell me to go to family or friends or anything because i do not have any i am completely alone and have been for my entire life i have no so so do not bother talking about that either it will just make it worse
not get back together i know you need your time to grow i had a nervous breakdown and started having suicidal thoughts called an ambulance just in case
i moved down her to be with her 14 years ago i have no friends no family and no social media presence i feel like venting but have no one to vent to i would asked i am in the wrong but i know i am not so frustrated and angry just wishing for something
but now i do none of those things my ex broke up with me because i am such a downer to be around
i was so happy with her and i miss all the little things that i never took the time to appreciate enough
i was very emotional these fews months and idk why but it is over we danced to music and kissed for the first time
everyone i talked to was there except me so i finally accepted that she just did not want to be friends with me
maybe it sounds weird but i feel like i have developed more of a personality without friends like i do not feel pressure to be a certain person anymore i kind of just do whatever i want and actually have been spending more time on things i used to love as a kid it feels kind of freeing in a way
i feel so distant with people and i do not know how to connect i have contemplated suicide and came very close twice
i have got a bottle of tramadol some benzos and a mess of other pills i will take them all together and drink a fifth of bourbon i will drive out to the woods and listen to some of my favorite songs and just slip away into the darkness nobody will notice for awhile and everyone myself included will finally feel free
you are blocked do not expect a handout making fun of me because i tried calling her in the middle of texting her
side note 2 i used to date this other girl for 4 years she was incredibly abusive controlling and manipulative i was only just able to move on 2 years after the relationship thanks in part to the ex from this story during my time with her i was not allowed to have passwords or privacy i was not allowed to talk to certain people everything i did had to be completely monitored
i immediately rejected her and told her the feelings would never be mutual again but after a few weeks i am having second thoughts about it
i am going back to april when i started to realize my loneliness is getting worse which spiraled to me probebly having depression
my parents got separated right when i was entering uni so i now live with my mother her anger issues have gotten better and she does not physically hurt me now
sometimes i envision myself on the building i was on when i was 14 on acid and saw heaven below me i wanted to jump
this parent gives me my alone time asks me for consent before making plans and respects my choices whenever i say no
i do not feel i can rely on my therapist as she would cancel on me last minute i feel my ability to be happy keeps slipping away from me and the fear of dying alone is creeping in
we all deal with hardships we all have things in our life that try and push us down but allow us to become resilient to push back and get up today get up stand up for you you are valid you are loved you are cared about by the divine god the universe by your peers
it hurts me to write this but i know it is for the best for now and i will always be cheering for your success and praying for you
then i saw from his face that he realised that i was exworker of this group too his face turned red and the situation went really awkward
i hate the fact even after all that when i am in the lowest phase when i am thinking what if i end it and die right now in the last moment of life it is still his face that i want to see still his voice i want to hear it is still his shoulder i want to rest to
i am done with life i try so hard to be positive i help everyone i can to be happy however i can
i have been training myself to go back to normal but the longest i can last is 1520 seconds sorry if this is a little much for this sub
if there was a way to turn my love for him off i would do it in a heartbeat because i do not want to deal with the pain of loving someone who does not feel the same anymore i am tired of crying about him even after all this time and i am tired of wondering when will i be over him
life just sucks right now and i see no point in walking this earth alone foreveri have family and friends but no one truly cares enough to actually make an effort
everyone always told me that things would get better maybe for them but for me it is constant hell not a day goes by that i feel alive
is being in a relationship really so scaryhard for men i know the issue was not that he wanted to sleep around like my ex or the rebound guy
i have always experienced feelings of social anxiety and while it is not as severe as most i know that it has negatively influenced decisions throughout my life and caused me to miss out on many opportunities both in my career and personal life
i am more mad that he was controlling about making sure i always tell him wherever i go and whoever i meet but the rules do not apply to him apparently
i want to have what their havingi want to have a girl hug me and kiss me and tell me that everything is going to be ok and that i am loved i want to hug a girl and kiss her and tell her how much i love her i want to lay in bed with a girl and have a nice cuddle session and talk to her and vent to her and have her do the same thing
he has been an abusive gaslighting narcissistic asshole my entire life and i feel this would give me the last fuck you
my wife was working so hard to make me feel better and she did i started to feel like i was worth it and that i was a great person
i know i used to have like big emotions idk much about that stuff but i have been told i am an empath idk
i have talked to my parents about going into therapy but they told me they did not have the money and that i was fine that i was happy
i do not want to feel like this anymore there is no point to this post i am just tired and want to die 75 of the time
over 2 years ago i finally broke free and found a job i moved to alaska to a small town i love and where i fit i rebuilt my psyche with the help of a great counselor i started exercising and taking care of myself i made friends i started getting out of debt
i will probably regret writing this post later but just hope putting this out into the world and being somehow heard will somehow ease this feeling that perhaps i am not even real or too different
but since you said that we could still be romantically involved someday texted a lot and hat close contact it gave me a lot of hope to get back together
thinking about other girls a little bit i still think about her and i still get a little lonely when nobodys around
i was unable to make some human interactions more than just saying hello each time i felt again so so so miserable that at one point i started not to go
i have arrived to the conclusion that if i did not have to work to pay my rent and food i would live inside in total isolation i feel good with myself i have a lot of hobbys and i am never bored and when i am alone i feel no frustration of having no girlfriend no stress from work where i just have to try to understand how i hurted someone susceptibility without even realizing it
yesterday my friend sent me a anise rather game on steam and i played it for like 20 minutes but i convinced myself that it was malwate and posted into the rcybersecurity subreddit
there is also the problem with her ignoring my anxiety and forcing me to be in situations that she knows triggers it i have really bad anxiety she also will purposely do things she knows upsets me
there could have been a slight just a slight part of me wanting a reciprocal apology but i very quickly realised that i did not need an apology or for him to recognise the ways he was erred me for me to get a closure that was a part of his journey in which i had no place in
however from mutual friends i have heard she is not doing super wellsorry for the long post i just want to rant and ask how to go through this
everyday i make sure that i am doing a few things that are fun getting outside bike rides playing video games meditating its amazing the amount of energy that can come from meditating from outside of ourselves it takes time it takes practice and i am constantly practicing everyday every moment
i recorded a podcast today about the election night and my break up during the election night it involves misunderstanding poems using cocaine on social media to make people jealous and embarrassingly reading a poem i wrote which is very bad it is a very unsettlingly bad poem
i was determined to stand beside you no matter what our peers and parents threw our way i was willing to help pay for that gender reassignment surgery and all of that therapy and the hormones
college is so hard and the worst thing is my family is poor and my dad straight up told me they are kind of relying on me to succeed which killed me inside
many chrimes and killings are related with this people being jealous or feeling betrayed when they cheat on them well rape is certainly related with sex feelings
i read many articles on how to alleviate loneliness from social distancing the top two suggestions are to have focused online conversations with loved ones and to serve others these advices do help however no articles have talked about the intense loneliness i feel when i am trying to be productive
since moving home i have managed to find a lovely flat to rent and after 4 months in the job i suggested a new job in the company for myself which was accepted
i just rejected cash as a christmas present lol i am a really a thrifty and frugal person who thinks every cent counts so i guess i am really to go anytime now
going out and eating enjoying birds at the park playing with our pet rabbit drawing cute stuff for her her secret man does nothing of that
i feel like coming out might fix my suicidal urges but there is an equal chance that it might lead to me killing myselfi want to leave this country and be alone but i also love my family too much to leaveand leaving will still only be possible if i can force myself through college and university and actually be able to earn for myself
sometimes i wonder if its you posting behind a screen however my heart is shattered i trusted you i loved you so much
9pm usual routine of mixed rice fried fish beef rendang fried egg pegedil heap of santan rice a commonplace chinese restaurant one table of two middle aged uncles sharing an ice bucket of tiger beers many other empty round marble tables two three arm stretches away with one two occupied old couple single man with tattoos looking out the silent ceiling fans ride the distant murmur of conversation
she has said she is got depression and anxiety and does therapy she has been hurt by people she also has issues with her dad maybe from a young age he has always been away and stuff so she has daddy issues she makes so many lies also for no reason and creates fake people or scenarios that do not exist
other breakups i have gone through have made it very clear my previous exes were really horrible matches for me which definitely helped me move forward
i do not know how but he convinced me that i should give this a second chance then suddenly four months later he breaks up with me randomly
the bad days are far less suicide is not an option and i have coping methods for the bad days when they do arrive
i think they would put me in inpatient treatment for a very long time and i can not handle thatthanks for listening i just really need someone to talk to or give me some advise
i feel like life is throwing me every curve ball it can throw at me at around 5 on the 8th my girlfriend wanted to do a zoom call just her and i
i know she is alive and save i asked her dad a couple times and he always told me she would text me
that last is not helped by the fact that due to a mix of mental illness and past alcohol abuse i have made some terrible decisions that have pushed good friends away not anything criminal or horribly serious just bad social stuff the alcohol thing i have under control thankfully and it never became an addiction
months later early this year she reached out to me again saying even after all the guys she met i was still there in her mind
it was the first day he did not text me good morning after that the texts became less frequent and he started isolating himself
i still love you so much and i want to be with you but i did not say it you do not want to hear it
the only two friends i have are more like acquaintances now as they live far from me only one wished me a happy birthday in a return text from me wishing her one two days before she could not even wait and remember to do it on the actual day
he was perfect and i do not know how i will ever find anyone as perfect as him ever again all i did was love him with my whole heart and i can not understand why it was not good enough
i can not bare to see her loving someone else it just breaks my heart but the reason i crave attention is cuz no one gives me that
last night was the first time since the breakup that i did my skincare routine it felt kind of nice after that it felt like domino pieces
just please help me figure out how to make him feel something again it is all i have wanted and been waiting for this whole year
he was jobless and lost while i felt i was continuing on and making a lot of progress in my life
i considered texting him to talk to see if we could be friends but i know that would only get my hopes back up of trying to fix an irreparable relationship and crush me again
i am getting lost on what to do she is my best friend and obviously i do not want to lose her since i have 2 rooms i even offered her to come live with me out of being desperate about it but i live in a different country and i guess that will not happen
sorry if this is a little much for this sub but i am unable to get therapy due to circumstances in my private life
i was sitting at a kitchen table with armed men and she sat across from me with no fear just a smile the next day we worked on it at her house it was massive her parents welcomed me with open arms and this was the start of my new life
it was good at the begining not to feel sad and alone it made me frustrated because i asked him if he was okay many time and she said yes
i am in therapy and i take medication which is meant to help but it just takes it toll on me know there is something wrong with me
but i get it now she gave me a reason to fight but it is not for her she showed me how to fight for myself
that she ends up with this relationship failing and her missing me and reaching out at least to apologize i feel like an awful person for hoping a partial unhappiness for her
i have tried the techniques done the selfhelp not good enough i am getting constant triggers that i do not have the ability to sooth stress covid symptoms stress and the stress is selfperpetuating
three days ago she got high and messaged me first turned out the idea was that she considered herself an abuser
i feel like i need to choose a gender i am also worried society will not accept me for who i am
i still love you but i was not happy anymore and it is not what i wanted anymore i tried to ask her what exactly made her feel this way but she would not say
i sang this girl to sleep most nights i knew her family she knew mine so the loneliness is pretty bad right now
just had christmas and i did not even know it was coming up or excited for it i went for a morning christmas walk on my own listing to music with my air pods in
now you probably value loyalty to some degree but you value love way more i am in this push and pull where i do not know what to do i am afraid of living
i only eat certain foods and i have been drinking only soda for 6 years now i drink about 6 liters of soda a week
i have been on meds and done therapy but nothing worksi am extremely lonely and do not know what to doi had a panic attack i just want to know if my loneliness is causing them
like what do they mean by this the whole issue is that my emotional state is a constant longing for the void you are supposed to fucking help me with this are you not like what the fuck is this supposed to mean even you have to want it yourself b i want a lot of things i can not help that i emotionally see happiness as unachievable due to long term problems and deep down want to fucking do the parachuteless base jump
i also feel scared sometimes that i will lose them because i may be too clingy or needy that is why i do not initiate much of the chats with them i actually limit myself and tell myself that i can only text them once every few days so that i do not seem clingy or needy
his ex sent me messages of them sexting for the first 4 months of our relationship we also have a lease that ends jan 2022
hey guys does anyone have any experience with an expartnerfriend who suffers from depression context my ex began feeling depressed a few months ago and we tried to work through it and thought things would be okay but around a month ago he decided to end the relationship
i had a panic attack today in a public bus i have never felt so scared and helpless no one knew what happened this is the most serious attack i have had this year i do not want to feel that way ever again i fear it might happen again and i will loose myself why did this happen
wow thanks to the fucking asshole who gave this the wholesome award chokethis is my first time posting so please forgive my grammer
i got sober i got healthy in both the physical and mental sense because i knew that would take me to the next level
some days i wake up with the will to end it all but i think about my wife family and what a shitstorm i will bring on them then i start to cry
it is been happening for a while but i have too much pride to tell anyone well that is just how it is i guess
i have had to do embarassing things because of that like yell at the mall say something that does not make sense talk to myself for a minute or hit myself in my face
i love and have fun with her but her presence means that i am always distracted and on an emotional rollercoaster
half the time i feel empty and half the time i do not feel reali can not decide if i want time to go back stop or speed up
that is never happened to me before and i have no history of anxiety or panic disorders so this was very strange for me
in person she seems fine we kiss we laugh we have a good time and then when it is over it is like she does not want to know me
repeated attempts to solve the relationships status end up in nothing i consistently fail to take the right action to truly set realistic course in terms of solving that problem
i do not really care i have told her plenty of times that is she and i never would work anymore in the morning we talked despite him being hung over
i could not even study because i would just keep repeating the same sentence or formula in the fear of forgetting it
ill still get my chance sooner or later so as long as they do not figure ill find a out of this life so i guess there is a silver lining somewhere
people other then my family no hate to them btw i love my family with all my heart notice me as a actual person and not a ghost
my sisters were angry at me for ever having been angry at our dad and god just i am always fucking wrong
once she got herself back on her feet i was just a reminder of a traumatic period in her life so i was thrown away
there are people raping kids or having sex with vih without telling it or using others bdsm sex is usually let us say dirty and yet most people see it somehow as something that must be sacred and see you as a crazy person if you do not see it as the most pure thing in the world
after she told me she was not sure what she wanted it came off as pretty obvious that i was not her priority and after some texting and me being desperate i gave up and wished her the best
i did not let myself fall but it still hurts that no one fucking stays around what the fuck is wrong with me
however the few women who have liked me in dating platforms have not been attractive to me in looks or mind
there were a lot of good memories but also quite a bit of bad and the bad got worse and more frequent as i got older and she stopped censoring herself around me
i try my best to give as much as i can because otherwise i think that i have no right to be otherwise
i tried opening up to my parents about it but my dad only proceeded to yell at me that i do not have a reason to be suicidal and that i am ungrateful
for whatever reason i do not feel any better at all and now i have just burdened my best friend with the knowledge that i am suicidal for no reason
i need help i feel numb and it fells like i am not in control anymore i get easily angered and its hard to remember the past i am no longer kind i do not ever want to go outside with any one and the only time i do stuff is with my friends online
i have also been spacing out a lot i can hear people i know what each word means but i can not understand
i feel crazy for this i do not know why i feel like this i am so happy taking to people all day but the minute i have no one to talk to i feel completely alone
and in my mind i still can not stop blaming myself for everything but i think we both know that if you had not have done the things that you did we most likely be fine now
she told me recently that she loves me deeply but does not feel the desire and passionso that is it reddit that is my story
i am so sad now i want her back even if i have to wait i probably done too much damaged that pushed her away further too many sleepless nights and i am so confused i can not stop thinking if we will get a chance someday or if she will reach out someday i do not even know why i am posting here
i can help and do good deeds all i want it will not change the fact that i am a terrible human being
this one is completely my fault it was getting serious so i opened up about my health condition this was a week before he comes home
i am going to the gym going for walks in the sun eating better i am laughing with my roommate calling my family members checking in on my other friends
over 4 months ago i was finally able to have a few hours alone with her and i did my best to vent about what i have been going through my progressing misophonia getting close to burn out and wanting to get tested for autismas burgers due to recent symptoms and a past diagnosis of it when i was a child
i feel alone a lot recently it is not like i do not have no one but i do not have a good relationship with my family and i have a few friends i do not know if they really care about me and even if they does i need them to demonstrate it
in a place she is not wanted in a house she hates and never likedsex is nice yeah but sex without love is just the worst
but i am feeling a little better not enough for me to rule out death completely but enough for me to be okay for another day
she was so forgiving she endlessly reassured me for the things i should not be insecure for about myself but i did not stop being like that
the way i express my feelings i do not i keep everything to myself just like my dad who is always been as cold as an ice cube with my sister and i and with my mom
i have not even recovered from the trigger that set me back to a dark place since last saturday and i have been crying since then
throughout the years i think i have had symptoms of ocd and social anxiety overthinking needing reassurance and guidance obsessive thoughts ect this is probably also why i want validation i have never been diagnosed or tested
to this i said i think i have the rights to speak to my friends about whatever the fuck i want
she said she gave it lots of thought and decided that with all that was going on with covid and school that she did not want to lead me on but wanted to stay tight and stay good friends because she said she did notice that we really connected and wanted me to stick around
could because she stressed me out too much the second time i told her that i was disowning her as my parents and that i no longer saw her as my mom both times she got incredibly angry at my dad and said that it was his fault and that he made me hate her which is not true this is because of the way she treats me
i asked her if she was leaving me for someone else and she said there was no one else of course this could be a lie she did give me slightly more feedback though which was that she still loved me but was not happy anymore
once i told them how i was really feeling they supported me in wanting to get better and i felt amazing finally telling somebody what i was going through
i am a digital artist and cosplayer my parents were not giving me much attention so now i am searching for it at all costs
best of luck with your situation op and to anyone else who might be going through a similar experience i did it i made it

my ex and i broke up just a little over two weeks ago we ended on good terms and she was very clear that she was going to use this time to focus on herself and that she wanted to get back together once she was able to actually make time for me

i have had lack of control over toxic things and people in my life but i used to struggle a lot with confronting people and cutting them out so the only way i could have some sort of control in life would be by getting rid of anything to do with those people or traumatic events instead of the ppl themselves

tldr fiancé of several years and i were making life plans just yesterday and now we are apartwe broke up almost a month ago i stopped crying a little while ago
after the large panic attacks i felt weird and searched my symptoms and ended up being derealization because by my trauma
the problem is that it was extremely cathartic and instantly soothed me it was like puking when you are sick and feeling so much lighter and having all of the agony of being ill lift from your body and i would never ever just done something like that without thinking because my brain usually works so slowly that it never occurs to me until after the fact

the main thing that stuck with me apart from depressionanxietyptsd and low selfesteem was if people found out who you really are no one would like you i had horrible hygiene in middle school due to my depression and they always shamed me for it they would threaten to take pictures of my room and upload them online or share them with my friends

ofcourse i want her back more than anything but i also want to move on while staying friends with her if i can not get her back i do not want to lose someone who fought for me for years and now after the brakeup and my lapses in judgement still cares deeply about me so i would apreciate any thoughts and advices sorry for the wall of text again

now i am stuck with this and i do not know what to do i was stupid to think that maybe you were different
time passed and i realized i hurt her feelings even though we were not going out together at the time i made her feel betrayed unloved and from her side she feels i lied for everything i told her before things like i like you i broke up with this girl my recent ex etc

that i would find that a man who would be equally caring and protective of me is already dead he is in heaven as much as i am not a woman of faith

during the break up she was surprisingly calm she said she somewhat saw it coming and had already come to terms with it because she noticed i was getting more anxious and acting more stressed i on the other hand was bawling like crazy and could not stop crying while she kept telling me it was okay to prioritize improving my mental health
and every day since then has been a catastrophic storm of self hatred fighting my desires for revenge suicidal thoughts resisting the urge to try and make it up to her and breaking my addiction to her
i do not know what to do it being the pain and anguish from when we got an abortion i was even more devastated
i can not help feeling like something is wrong with me that causes people to not text me or reply after like 14 hours
but now this anxiety hell that i am in just is not letting up everything i see makes me feel bad and i feel like i am losing it

where after a few months of deteriorating and ultimately comically failing performance i had to quit did so on very friendly terms and all was as usual so fucking friendly appreciative and nice because i was by all means wellrespected in the place i worked at i was also dying inside none of it none of it constituted any deeper nonwork relationships

the most recent one a few days ago to suicide i have been struggling with depression and i just feel like giving up and just ending it
i can not express you how i felt by that time i really had to take strong tranquilizers and antidepressants to cope with it
i also hate when i see other couples being happy i feel resentful now towards hot girls in my head it is always the thought that they do have that 6pack millionare pampering them and will not even look at me about those who brag about their social life or about men who brag about their sexual life
it underscores an underlying message of a delusional outlook on what is considered to be evilthe same story goes for disciplining a child to grow up thinking they are going to heaven
do you think it is bad in my situation to hold onto hope i know that some quotes i read online have been like if it is truly meant for you it will come back but i have also read quotes that said if he truly loved you he never would have left you
i just want you to know you reading this that you are not alone there 1000s of people that are coping embracing and healing from the same thing that we all are in this very moment and with that thought it makes it truly relieving relieving to know that we are all in this together together separately

i am interested in hearing everyone is experience with lockdown and quarantine whether it was what caused your loneliness or it did not make a difference in your life since you lived a permanent quarantine due to your loneliness
i think that i know exactly how i want to do this i have a solid plan now one of my best friends did it a couple of months ago and while i would use a different method some of the things he did would be useful to keep anyone from being able to stop me
this really helped me even if it is just a momentary reprieve i just wrote down what i was feeling and did not let myself leave until i was done

she saw me walking with another girl who was also my most recent ex girlfriend i am going through the mid20s crisis
any thoughts on what might being going on in this girls mind she has told me that she sometimes freaks out at times and she gets triggered however it seems like she does it mostly to me as i am always there for her and she sees me as someone that maybe she can take advantage of because if she did this to anyone else they probably will not care or be hurt by it
i started pleading and tried to remind her that i helped her and she helped me but she made up her mind and wanted to work on herself
i forgave him and got back together his mom who is every well off gave me a job when i got better
but you slept with another girl i want to work this out and rebuild our trust but i have too much self respect
i did everything i could do to make this relationship a fairytale i even composed a song just for her and all that i did was thinking about her and showing her my love

in the end we decided on a friendship pausei do not tell my therapist how seriously my suicidal thoughts are because i do not want to be involuntarily hospitalised

i am so alone i literally have no one my brothers have their kids my mom is not someone i can talk to and i am just alone completely
it is nice of them to reach out but part of me would prefer they not as things have ended with my ex and he is with someone else now
plus its not like there is any other guy that wants me anyway it felt nice knowing that there was at least one person who cared for me romantically
she said when she broke up with me and i do not remember everything that she felt like she was beginning to love me less the past couple of weeks
i will not laugh with him until my rib cage hurts i will not be able to tell him about the good days
and idc care anymore do not ever come to my fucking house againbut one day i will and then the thoughts will stop
another thing was he said he cared for me but in our relationship i could tell by many of the things he said and did he was still lonely though if i had my way i would have spent all my extra time with him and given up talking to other people to speak with him because i preferred him
maybe i am just jealous because about 23 weeks ago we were pretty damn close but now he just stopped talking to me as much
for a long time i have felt like i do not do enough in the relationship he does basically everything because my anxiety causes me to not be able to live life like a normal person should and i am very insecure about that
after university during a dire financial stage i was using a 200 netbook with a nine inch screen it was adequate for my desperate job applications and email but it creaked when i typed and i felt embarrassed to use it in public i thought i could open up the netbook and add some internal cushioning but i broke all the clips and i could not reassemble the machine
i am pretty much alone this christmas it is so quiet and so lonely i know i could call somebody talk to a friend or something but it is christmas and i do not want to ruin it for them
i recently found out that she is on tinder now and i am just at a loss of words about it i have been going through the motions of being sad and mad both at the same time
she used to point to the moon and tell me stories every night while feeding me i learnt the meaning of kindness from her
i have friends and family and money but nothing is filling the feeling i am trying to fill not drugs not money not people not even myself
and the worst part is i genuinely enjoy self harmand i really just want to die i know how i act on the outside is probably much different
but he never taught me anything and i do not think he truly loves me because he too looks right through me
majority of the students in my cohort are also locals and i feel like i am left out as being an international student there and i am unable to click with anyone plus living in a countryside it is the same concept where the locals here are those farmertype of people and the nearest city is 2 hours away
i should feel like life is good i have a good future ahead of me my family is doing well and i am doing well
when he broke up with me and left my sister texted him asking him to talk to me and he said she will be fine but i am actually not
no one can do this like me keep repeating and it is just so hard to get through a day i am unable to post any statuses or anything because of these thoughts
at what point do you know to walk away despite how badly it may hurt seeing how shitty our relationship currently is vs what it used to be breaks my heart i do not know what to do anymore i am just so tired of being so sad
despite this recently i have just really been struggling to shower recently and if anyone has any advice i would really appreciate it
she wants me to do good in school but never wants to step in and ask what i need help with
she proceeded to block me on snapchat and text me on imessage saying that she was sorry she did that to me and that she knew she was shitty
i do not want to live without her every day i live without her is a painful and lonely existence i feel like i was robbed of a true opportunity at happiness and acceptance and love
finally had time to find some hobbies work on my mental health i just sit there in silence and stare i do not even cry anymore
i chose to because she explained to me that she hated her husband and planned on divorcing him in the near future
i do not have those people and that is one of the reasons why i am scared to move out of my familys home
the thing is sometimes i feel like those people could see me through my eyes it is like they are inside me but they are not at the same time that is why i do things in the dark to block my vision so that they can not see me literally every possible normal thing
i have gone through the denial stage lasted only a day and the anger stage really consumed me i became childish in my insults and not letting it go every time we communicated i wanted him to know i was angry not that he cared
the laboratory for the study of anxiety disorders at the university of texas at austin is conducting a no cost intervention study examining how mindfulness may reduce feelings of loneliness during covid19
she was my first love and i was her first as well i mean we did acid one of the first times we met and had sex if anyone here has done that you will know that is a big deal anyway it is not about the sex for me but that night was a huuugggeee deal for me and made me want her
he says he still cares about me and my wellbeing but i do not know how true that is i just want to tell him that none of this is his fault
i already bought her favorite snacks and food but i feel like i could do more does anyone have advice on how i could make her more comfortable every advice would be highly appreciated
although i have friends and seem to be fine with making friendships etc my main loneliness was due to never having any more than friend type encounters with women or any chemistry with girls almost 25 now and still a virgin lol rip
he taught me how to find love within myself again and he has taught me that i am lovable i guess i am writing this because i do miss him and his companionship but i know he deserves better
my tolerance for people is so low i can not handle emotional baggage and sentiments i am too straightforward and logical in thinking i want to be able to put myself out there but i have never felt the need to the feelings involved in doing so i am justnumb
i have not really thought about it in the past but today something triggered that memory and i do not know if i had a panic attack or what but i went to my room dropped to my floor and started crying my eyes out
but i still feel this hole and want to meet someone and have human connection or perhaps connections i am thinking of might be too idealizedromanticized perhapsand most likely everyone might be selfish so i am also little worry about it
so i have 3 characters one with anorexia nervosa another one with schizophrenia and the last one has obsessive compulsive disorder
it felt great so i pulled tighter until i felt lightheaded and immediately needed to lie down so i fell down on my bed
it appears that no one can help me i do not know what i am supposed to do if i am getting passed over or dumped by therapists
i love him like crazy and we live in the same house so i swallowed everything and decided to fulfil his wish
i looked around on reddit but a man still frothing with hate after 8 years is not particularly common and i have no basis to pair this against
she gave up on the relationship 4 months before this it is her responsibility to apologize for this horrendous act against me and beg for me back
my father tells me to stop taking my antidepressant antipsychotic and mood stabilisers because i need to be strong they make me worse and other bullshit big help eh
and for now i have a clue that i have trustopening up issues low selfesteem due to domestic physical violence i was flogged by my parents due to bad behaviour or something that i did wrong domestic psychological violence shouting at me for many of reasons threats
i do not make good money i am almost 30 and i have no one everyone my age is in relationships has families great jobs and am i such a loser at this point the only reason i am still here is because i know no one will take care of my cats when i am gone
i just get so disappointed every now and then i always try to uplift myself but always fail because i see something totally disappointing
now i have none the few i had were toxic anyway and here i am grieving and having a hard time moving on
we are in our mid 20s and were together for 85 years since highschool but during last 2 years of the relationship everything was going downhill
6 months down the line i discovered that he was still communicating and still seeing the other womanlately my brain has just been shutting off idk
around october i reached out to ask how she was doing her mental health went downhill was not too good before same as mine she was in a really bad place
something in me just snapped i did not flip out or anything but i never bothered trying to interact with her again
after i saw a lot of doctors they told me it was nothing to worry about kind of scary seeing blood in ur throat tho
at its core selflove is the view you have towards your failures it is the state of appreciation for yourself grown out of numerous actions directed towards your personal psychological and spiritual growth
i work my ass off for a corporate job i recently graduated with my masters degree and am finally living out my career goals
i told her about my imposter syndrome and she said do not worry abt it my real name we all care abt you that was the nicest feeling i have ever had in my life and it is nice to know that someone cares about me
as far back as i can remember i have had this feeling i feel sad because sometimes i just feel like i am so disconnected from everyone else
they already have enough friends they have family they have never accepted my beliefs and it sucks that i will never get their approval because of it
i want you to forgive me and give me one more chance i wish we never in a relationship so i never hurt you like this
i honestly feel like shit that i can not find anyone that wants to be with me thanks for letting me rant have a great day everyone
the things i want to do go out with friends to eat explore areas do fun thingsi feel like i missed the train i have missed life so i am done
in the back of my mind i am worried about dating again in my 30s but right now i am mostly just hurting about the idea of being with anyone besides her which is stupid because it was a mutual breakup that i probably could have stopped if i wanted to
i got a issue that bothers me lately let me explain it i feel disconected i feel i cannot form new bonds and the old ones are rusted and fragile
i am definitely a giver i like to give to people but no one wants what i can give its the first time i ever told someone that i loved that they were a cunt
does it help me move forward no it does not help me move forward because it is making me move backwards because it is making me less confident and less focused on the good things about me
instead of breaking up with me he led me on all these years and put an expiration date to our relationship
i was already going through a bunch of serious family stuff and he came over and stayed with me until i felt better and left four days later
she had previously said to me multiple times that she wanted to leave that town and go somewhere new periodically she would shit on me on twitter but that has ceased
i have friends and family even the occasional person i talk to online for support but i feel so completely alone anyway
even with the worst of my depression i tended to not reach outit is partly because when i was a kid there was really noone to reach out to that could help partly bad experiences reaching out to people partly because i am the person people usually reach out to when they have problems partly because when i am in a negative state of mind i literally do not have the words
she said that having kids with her now husband made her think about how horrible it is that i do not have a family
edit worst of all i worry about my grandparents passing in the next few years it makes no sense but i can not help myself and tear up every time i think about it
so i have been with my current girlfriend for about 5 months yet when she talks about her friend it makes me look back to when my ex cheated on me with my best friend behind my back my ex talked about my best friend a lot and my current gf talks about her friend for half an hour on the phone normanlly what should i do
5 years ago it was not exactly sexhey all first off i would like to wish everyone a happy holidays and hope they have a fantastic day
i was not looking for him to fix anything for me but i think he was doing it just so he did not have to think about trying to fix his own issues
but it sucks anytime i hit a milestone i feel like it is not a big deal i have told my friends i am 10 months clean and they just say nice
i have even seeked therapy in the last week i am actively trying to change it hurts so bad we had a beautiful relationship
she got lost because apparently my sister and my mom thought it was natural for cats to be able to come and go as they please so they allowed her to stay outside at night i think about that all the time and how i could have tried to avoid it
i just do not know what to do if i have to go homeless i am not sure my mental health can take it and i am not sure what to even do
my forehead the back of my neck and my throat hurting is my bodys nightly routine but these things are not actually caused by anything physical
i am meeting her in april as i come back to visit my family but i fear this distant relationship will not work out i do not want her to throw away possible opportunities of getting with someone just because of me
sooo i decided to go into no contact i started to realise that he really does not deserve me and i started to accept the break up and go into the proces
i have been lucky enough to travel a bit and have interesting experiences my personality and mind while heavily effected by mental illness etc is ok i am a reasonably good person and i have turned the constant rumination into a job skill and to creativity too
rewind 2 years ago i had my first relationship but when i broke up with my partner he got mad and sent me death threats
i miss my best friend so so much i thought i would be okay i thought i was starting to move on
i f 22 have been feeling down recently does anyone feel like sometimes like you do not exist to the people that you love
meanwhile i got to leave for work in 20 minutes so baby wipes and deodorant and body spray it is i feel disgusting
i makecreatemanifest my life into a movie scenemusic video that is all i know to say please help me important i never had suicidal thoughts or cutted it was not near that level
i have started to watch the sunset by myself each day i search for those almondshaped brown eyes that filled me with so much joy as i pass by strangers at the park i often think maybe you will be here too looking for my eyes but you never are and you likely never will be
no matter how hard i try i will never get to be normal i wanted to wait but i could not wait any longer
the family that refuses to get me proper help and that partially contributes to me wanting to die some people say hope
when we spoke he seemed to soften and realise that he is just been on one track and there is my side too
i moves my head to my sholder and see like the horizon moving with it up to 30 degrees my window still not moving
its my way of being so cold to their feelings to the point they think i am dead inside fuck one more will not hurt
more sad for you than me and i am the one who got dumped honestly us texting did make me breathe a little easier
as i sit in the last chair left in the empty apartment that used to be called ours i think of where a first love comes from
i have nothing nobody that i can care for or have care for me i have even lost interest in all my hobbies i feel lost alone and hopeless i need help but i do not know where to go or qhat to do
in the past i have had very short one sided relationships and unrequited loves and i am always the one being ghosted or broken up with
i have been doing that for a very long timesadly it was not until after that that i started to come to terms to the reality of my situation
i feel like i need a lot more time to process the breakup and to heal but for my ex it took no time at all and that just really hurts
of course things have now gotten even worse thanks to the coronavirus happening now i can no longer go to meetups and events even if i wanted to and even if i could be assured other people would be going most of them have been canceled indefinitely
then when we would be talking he would always be on videocall with her even though we barely had anytime together and he hated videocall and had refused to do it with me for about a month at the time
i can not leave the house since my sibling and one of my parents are highrisk so my entire day used to consist of attending virtual class doing homework watching some tv and going to bed
and then on top of it she often talks about people who nobody knows and she must realize it like she talks about her friends who none of us know but as if we would know them
covid and lockdown had terrible effects on me the lockdown started in march and for one month i could not get out of bed when i facetimed my gf in the evening i was irritated because she was trying to tell me to get up and act against this depression
so i grinded on one of the boys for less than five seconds and told my friend we needed to leave and i needed to see my boyfriend
i think that is pretty toxic of me before i forget i have to say that i am listening to the pokemon national park theme and yeah
i have been married for 17 years and have 3 children i was loyal and 100 committed to our marriage a month into the lockdown l discovered that my husband had an affairs with a 23 year old for 3 years she is now 26 years the have a child together born this year who is a week older than my child also born this year 2020
well i do understand he might have not meant it but i really also expected an apology because this did not just happen once
since i am an avid fan of true crime and the psychology behind it it did not take me too long to connect the dots
so it seems that 2020 is not done with me just yet it had to make my start to the year bad and after 6 months worth of work and effort to fix myself it seems that now it wants to do the same thing to me again
and since the whole day i have been questioning myself felt like oneupped the conversation hard and generally felt bad about it
not starting and ignoring people will only leave me with the same results i have desperate to avoid isolation and loneliness so i will try not to be hesitant and hopefully that eventually leads me to meaningful conversations or friendships
she never explained herself refused to reply got her guy friends to threaten me we had a really nice day had dinner together and talked a lot
he was initially much more into me than i was him as i was reserved about the age difference but he did not want me in his life he could not get attached
i still have my issues with people more than ever now honestly but i have my close friends whom i have known for 80 of my life
every week when i would change in gym class i was groped by the surface of my breasts like the victim of any sexual misconduct i told no one
i hope some day i would be happy too how do i get over a breakupme and my girlfriend of 3 years broke up twice
i did take her word on that but what bugged me was that she always on social media and would constantly be posting
i am finally starting to see changes in my care plan she just treated it like i was an annoying fan which i am
i know i am a very despicable person for thinking of doing this when my parents have paid for me to be in a uni abroad
we just broke up 6 days ago after almost 5 years together you were there for me when my dad died
right now i am thinking that i need to find someone who is the same minded as me who feels lonely on parties or can not bond with people near her yes i want to find a woman because no gross intended i can become more open and intimate with a woman than with a man
it hurts because he knew getting into the relationship i have insecurity issues with myself as well as depression and he promised he could handle it
i do not want to get into too much detail but i find myself looking for pornographic content where the person has the same voice and talks in the same way of my abuser it feels like an addiction and whenever i am done with my business i feel terrible
in middle school i despised every feminine and developing aspect of my body so much i confused these feelings as gender dysphoria i identified as trans for 3 years until i finally realized that transitioning would not alleviate my problems by this time my narc dad was making comments about my body behind my back to my own mother
when i am close to killing myself i tend to risk things so i got in a relationship that only caused me pain and broke my heart
i just want to end it all all the pain betrayal sadness grief loneliness i want all of it to end
you are a zombie with no brain but thoughts swirling through your head constantly you want to talk to people but feel like your existence is a burden for everyone else
i know that with more time things will get better but it is just so hard i hate everything about me i do not want to write this but maybe someone else is like me
thank you for your input but it is not your place anxiety is exhausting and it is not a choice do you not think if we could fix our anxiety by getting our lives together we would have done it already saying this completely undermines and invalidates the constant struggle of anxiety and honestly we do not need it
i do not see any future in sight for me by the time i am eighteen and i get out of here my entire life will have been wasted
my parents broke up when i was 10 and my whole world fell apart i was taken away from my father and siblings and rarely saw them causing severe damage to our bonds
as yet another christmas passes and i am alone i woke up at 5pm in the afternoon i decided to do it today
i keep telling myself that i am never good enough never worth anything because what i achieved must have been a lucky guess
i just had a breakdown out of no where i burst out crying the silent cry you do when you do not want to be heard when really you feel like screaming infact i am still crying while typing this
i changed 3 job places one where i was alone one with another guy and one where i had to work with many other people
5 months into my relationship with my best friend of 17 years and we are now officially broken upi swear i can not take this anymorei do not need replies like there are a lot of girls
and i do not know why it caught me completely off guard and i told him that i just mixed different perfumes together today and that may be why
not degrading myself or anything it is just how it is i feel like i am lacking sense of humor today is a bad day
i currently can not get a job since i had surgery recently and in a week or so will be starting some hormone pills and such and do not know the side effects yet
i knew what i was doing was wrong but kept doing it anyways i truly came to the conclusion that i was an incel and i still stand by that today
i built an app which i am currently testing which is based on cbt exercises i think it might be helpful or interesting to anyone who experiences low confidence or lack of elf esteem
its been 3 weeks i am failing online school none of my friends like me this crushing weight in my stomaach will not go away
i know she has moved on and she had every right to but i can not get around this fact it makes me feel so alone
i am alone in another country i know i am not love of his live or even most important i can not believe i am at the beach for once i felt alive and free
all that because they do not want to feel alone on most days i am alone but not lonely but when i get weak and vulnerable these feelings float up and it makes me want to just get the easy way out and just settle for anything that comes by yet i know i will not be able to be fully happy if that happens
i am scared to type it because i do not want to it happen but really she was fine just in the shower
you are an ideal friend and persona with your friends and in a relationship you are deeply passionate these are the most desirable traits for anyone seeking a happy life and happy you have made me all the time i have known you
she insists she will need my paintings off the walls so she can slide her back against the wall and get upstairs
i am a 17 year old guy at this point in time i feel like i will just not find anyone to love ever
even when i brought up a couple weeks ago not being able to wait for the day to come and how excited i was for them
my ex girlfriend and i broke up almost 3 weeks ago we have were in no contact for two weeks she broke up with me due to the fact that she had mild depression and felt like she did not have control over her life and as much as we tried so could not put in the effort she wanted to she said once she got her life together she would want to try again
it honestly feels like july but i look at the date and it is 2 days until christmas i do not feel like i am about to be 16 i do not honestly feel like i should have an age
i need some advice on this i do not feel normal these couple of months especially with everything happening i find myself having mood swings and weird urges that i can not help myself doing and also extreme paranoia i always suspect something that is very irrational just to name a few things if anyone can help me on what to do i would like the help thanks
right it started hitting me again like crazy i would get sadhappy randomly again but more stable a mood for a week stable but not stable actually i still do not see any patterns reasons or causes
if you have read any of my other posts you may know i have been going through a really tough breakup over the past week
i started getting clingy and attached and he started drifting away i did not want to lose him so we decided on just friends
i am stuck and do not know what to do anymore any advice would be much appreciated i feel so alone i do not do any good for this world
i wish i had gotten along with my family i just wish i did not feel like i had to do this all myself
i have been able to vent to him in the past and he was very supportive so if i start i know it should be fine
it all went to hell yesterday with short pauses i have been crying for 27 hours now instead of asking me directly he asked my sister
he was ending terrible horrid things to my father and that triggered everything again i had another panic attack but i did not tell anybody this time
like the idea that i might be addicted to the adrenaline has been in my head for a while and this rush has been ingrained in my daily routine especially before covid for example when i travel somewhere on my bike i usually use an epic or stimulating song to trigger the frisson to give myself a jump start
i have been really good at distracting myself from the break up with friends or hobbies like going on walks or to the gym or cooking obvs not options right now bc of leaving the houseno sense of taste haha for the past month
i watched basically the whole trial of nevada vs warmachine yesterday and by the end of it i felt similarly to how i feel now like someone is punching me in the stomach over and over again and there is nothing i can do to stop it except to try and distract myself with something and not think
i do not need to suffer through this shit i spent my christmas eve alone at a fucking bar scrolling through old pics of my kids
it is a struggle to get up every morning after having dreams about him every night but i force myself out of bed and do the extra steps of skin care and flossing along with the normal things
i am so mad at her for making me believe that i had met the one i am so mad at her for being the most beautiful woman i have ever set eyes on
who else wants a pet so that they feel less lonelyit sucks knowing at times that you fail or arnt well skilled in the areas of wooing someone
if she walks in my room even for just one second while i am working out i cannot continue working out i just get extremely angry and have to calm myself down
recently as in a few months ago i remember watching videos about michael jordan and someone in the comment section was talking about a mental disorder he believed jordan and other super competitive people to have
i even gave you a chance after leaving me in my current state to talk things out and make them right and you did not care about it
she thought we would eventually marry and get kids i wish issues like this were talked about more so i guess here i am
it is so sudden and feels about as casual and normal as planning to make a sandwich in some cases it is the lack of fear terror i should say that startles me the most
everyone is welcome here our main goal is to provide a fun and therapeutic place for people to feel happy accepted and comfortable
recently this past year i did feel occasional anxiety and had my down days about everything going on this year but nothing that ever concerned me that i had any problems
i do not even want this hindrance to burden my family i do not want to be unfair to those who can actually do something
we broke up and she kept posting stories on her social medias of her hanging out with other guys and drinking etc
i really wanted to move out because my parents keep me so sheltered and sometimes i feel trapped and it is honestly not even their fault but i just hate feeling like i have no control over my life
i just do not see a point it is like the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off for me and i can not find the light switch to turn it back on
this rubbed me the wrong way and made me worried that he saw me as a hassle i got back and he was super dry with me over text oneword texts and things just felt
i just read an article about being in relationships when you have difficulties with intimacy and emotions and one of the pieces of advice was involve your partner suggesting exercises such as sharing emotions by leaving notes for each other
i mean after she broke up i asked why and she said she could not handle the distance did i lack somewhere i can not stop thinking about her
i have contemplated suicide a few times but do not want to put my wife through the trauma of finding me and the burden of having to make final arrangements not to mention the financial strain that would put on her
i always thought about developing a project to help people and most of the time that project came to me as a personal diary from every single person a place where you can express your feelings but also ask some questions about your life and how to move one
want to know the question she asked read the full article herehttpswritewhatcomesblogspotcom201806invisibilitypowerofsilencehtmli try so hard but get nothing others get it without any effort
it is always been like this ever since i was a kid where i try to make friends and in the end i always end up alone
you do not develop courage by being happy in your relationships everyday you develop it by surviving difficult times and challenging adversity
but i feel like in order to get along with them i may have to change my personality completely with i am not 100 up for
i go from having a day with someone and away from the lonliness to 6 days of being alone again and feel like i am bugging him every time i text him
think about never having a good job no wife maybe i will die a virgin or never kiss a girl and as cliché as it may be
i am going to make a paper copy and pin a copy to the home screen of my phone to make sure there is at least a reason given for my suicide if i go through with it please provide criticism for anything that should be changed
i have tried a lot of things to change that in the past few years i have taken up taekwondo joined a local drama group traveled to the other side of the world by myself and met some great people there
we usually call each other n show what we got which i can not fucking do because i feel like hell and i do not want that to be seen
it is been 2 weeks and i can not stop crying over him but you need familyfriends around you that love you i do not know what i would do without my mom
this ordeal with one more person i love it is proven to me everyone is better off without me at this point the only good thing i can do for the world is leave it
they say universitys the time in your life where you make everlasting friendships and relationships what a fucking lie could never give me a direct reason as to why
the reasons she left are because i made her feel so overwhelmingly insecure and because of that she has not trusted me for a long time
she finally had the courage to make the break from her husband and moved in with her brother and his wife
but i was too late full blown psychosis with 5 different audio hallucinations going on and on nothing that is their fault and i can not alleviate it
she knew i struggled with how i felt about myself even to the point that i attempted suicide yet she still did this for the past few days i have been giving it some thought and i think she might be right i am a worthless person who no longer wants to live i am likely going to go jump of a bridge tomorrow it would be what she wants anyway
and yet before even a full week was over there is already one group of friends established by the second week there is another
i told her that i was not getting enough attention but instead of consoling or talking to me she used to pickup fights amd one day i was studying for an exam i she said she wanted to talk to me on the call i asked if its its something important she said no then i told her that i was studying then she goes on to say that i can take out time
last night after my small gathering i drank wayyy to much and texted her real late like 2am but she replies so we get to chattin but then she quickly gives me leave me alone vibes too i ask to call and she says no i in broken english because again i was drunk flat out asked her over text are we friends right now she says yes
i have a lot of goals and dreams but afraid to start over and disappoint i do have faithmy current therapist is the only therapist i have seen more than twice in the past decade
she does not even know i am struggling with my drinking and smoking problem because i am supposed to be upholding this image of myself that over portrayed to her
i just want to meet someone who will see the beauty that i have inside of me and all the love i am willing to give
my standardized tests are good and i have already applied to a couple of colleges but beyond all reason i feel like the world is about to end
i feel very confused and blindsided by everything because i thought his was the person i would spend the rest of my life with and i genuinely feel confused as to why we ended things
just walking back and forth with my head down for about an hour each night just trying to build up the courage to jump off at the center 500 feet above the river below
for about a month after the breakup we were still talking still trying to figure things out but as time went on she grew more and more stressed with things outside of us that ultimately carried over into her not being able to deal with all of it
middleschool also marked the end of a lot of my old friendships and in a weird attempt to fit in i chose to act out weirdly and sexually
i have had a life filled with trauma and abuse and i suffer from bpd 1 anyways someone who i was in love with recently left me for someone else
i spent my time in the hospital painting journaling and envisioning ways i would kill myselfi want to preface by saying i am aware this is gross and i wish i did not do this
i do not know what to do i feel stuck and i am not sure what to doi started feeling lonely only after i passed high school
i am usually the mean strict parent but my wife was helping me change that as well now i i have an even shorter fuse
i could not say much at first but i slowly opened up more and more being honest about my mental health for the first time ever
cycle of pain i have been at this point over 10 times and i honestly do not know if ill actually do it this time
every since lock down started i have been forgetting things i read that is normal because of lockdown but i literally do not remember what i did yesterday i do not remember some things i did 5 minutes ago i need help and idk who to talk to
writing novels etc but i have been struggling to just stay alive to just make ends meetshe decides to vent to ot guy about it on facebook
he is gay and i am lesbian so we are just friends yes the thing is recently he has become more and more saturated of me that is what he says
it is as though my own mind is baiting me with what a better life would be like i can not take it anymore waking up and realizing that my life is not what i want it to be
it made somewhat sense to break up the only thing he was really bringing to the table was his own plate but i loved him so much that i just let it happen until i could not let it happen anymore we have not spoken in one week and it is been a rollercoaster of emotions
firstly i suspect that i suffer from schizotypal or avoidant personality disorder for reasons you maybe can see in the text above but if not i have a hard time believing in myself in my daily life i have few friends and struggle at making more i crave intimacy but i never allow it to myself and i selfisolate a lot
i had always hated the thought of people feeling sorry for me and feeling inclined to be nice or dishonest with me
i got dumped about 3 weeks ago by my boyfriend but like i am still friends with them and i took it well at the time but since every time he speaks i struggle to want to be alive without him
i had not been in a relationship for 25 years leading into this past relationship so i was quite independent and loving life
he and i have grown so distance over the last ten years i hardly know him anymore when i visit my parents he will not even say hi back when i say hello i feel so terrible for my parents my mom defends him saying nothing is violent but myself and other brothers know the truth
i am a waste of life and resources and wish i was gone but i am too much of a pussy to do anything lmao
just recently he took a break from instagram but he had not told me about it personally and i had to hear about it while we were with friends together
eventually i lost those friendships when one female friend called me fcked in the head for choosing a man like him they did not know him i did
i 16 just brought it up casually while doing the dishes and he laughed i told him it is not funny and he said okkk what is wrong with you then and he laughed again
it sucked because he was having a hard time as well and i could semiunderstand what was going on but i could not talk and eventually i fell asleep or went under for good i do not really know
the second i held my little girl soothing her as a mother would i sang to her fed her took her for walks in her pram
it is not a big deal all my friends are still in the same school but still the interaction lowers this made me realise that this is just life at a small scale
so my ex left four months ago after a little over 20 years married i was devastated and thought i could never get over her i laugh at the way i was now i feel good and in a better place then i ever did when i was married
luckily i did not have much on my plate so i was able to force it down and avoid the you are not sick are you question
i just want my partner in crime somebody i can always talk about my day with and cuddle with and love on and support and be supported by is that too much to ask for why can not i have that what is so wrong with me
this week is just the icing on the cake i am having major issues with my job the holidays made me realize that everyone really is happy without me and my boyfriend who is been the closest thing to my best friend just broke up with me i have nobody in real life to turn to i have no real friends no best friends no family i really am completely alone despite having friends on the internet
what i did learn from calling the veterans national crisis line is that i will need to get on social media
we broke up 2 weeks ago and i still can not see how i am going to get through thisshe was everything to me and my best friend and now we do not even talk
anyways high school started i am on my 10th grade and i have a group of friends they were all from the same school and knew each other since childhood we would always hang out at school but it did not evolve beyond that and i started to think well they might hang out without me since they know each other way back and then i finished high school without going to a single event or party or anything of that kind
hi 21m here the quarantine makes me feel lonely as all hell two weeks ago me and my ex broke up all my friends are depressed themselves so i do not want to bother them i just need someone to talk to i guess i feel empty as if i am missing something
i cried letting her go on the bus and seeing that excited smile from behind the window time must have jumped because she was a little older and playing with my mothers paints
my ex got into a new relationship after only a month and half i still cried abt her and worried abt her mental health and shit but she does not actually care abt me
my dad is constantly in my mind however i fear if he does not make it i will have once less reason to hold on
and that he was seeing someone else now every time i walk into my bedroom it just feels empty and it depresses me a lot
you never went in a relationship with them to take any advantage of themyou were there to stay and build a future family with them
it is weird but i asked her about all those that come to her mind by asking about her favorite memories for example about the favorite thing that happened in our last years friendship and she said i can not decide because i can not remember any specific favorite thing but she easily can remember the whole story we had in that period
i am almost never happy or even content with life anymore my emotions constantly flip between depression and rage every few minutes
and then feels guilty about it the next day when he sobers up and proceeds to do it when he gets really hammered he literally slurs his texts
we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive empathetic nonjudgemental support to our ops and we particularly thank everyone who is already been reporting incitement in all forms
let us say i was going to sleep i would imagine someone is with me or i was studying i would imagine someone a boyfriend maybe was sitting with me also studying
so lately i have been feeling depressed and lonely more and morei think i had a lot of opportunities in my life to try to do the things right
the fear that i would like mostly in a sexual way to hurt people came from the fact that i used to get turned on by torture stuff never wanted to act it out and i could easily get turned on by normal things too but i do not think i do anymore i am afraid i still do though
by all accounts my life has been a good one and i acknowledge that i have never gone to bed with no food in my gut or with no heatac because we did not have the money and all the other things that generally make ones life pleasant i openly acknowledge all of that
i can not remember anything i am always forget things my mental emotional and cognitive skills are not normal i fold in on myself if that makes sense
i do not talk to people about it as i am the one always there for others helping them with their problems i do not mind this as i am more than willing to help people find their happiness even tho i doubt i will ever find my own i am sure some of them would be there for me to vent too if i asked but it just is not my way it is too hard for me
if you do not want to talk to anyone keep a diary or journal to write your feelings in and hide it even if you are a guy it is okay to have a journal or diary it is just a name and it is okay to cry crying actually can help release the stress weighing on you for all the people who do not have depression this is my favorite quote from drseuss
they did not like him and they wanted nothing with him it makes sense though this is the coldest emptiest loneliest and most heartbroken that i have ever felt in my life
i am struggling through a lot right now and i have gone through hell to get to where i am today but that is another story for another time
i make lists and then by the end of the day i tell myself i will do it tomorrow life just feels like an endless pointless cycle most days
i know he is a problematic person and not good for my health and i have come back to him everytime only to break up again for the same reasons
it is been a year since i stopped college because i knew i was going nowhere but after a year of research i still can not find anything i really like i do not have any real hobby no real goal no pleasures my parents love me but i know they just want all this mess to end
and i feel really awful i have had to tell them i did not want to report because did not want him in more trouble he is done this himself
how can i tell them that i appreciate their invite but am unable to make it what if they repeatedly ask me out i feel terrible for repeatedly turning them down since they are making the effort to reach out to me first
there were other issues such as me a night owl and not being able to stay in bed in the silence of a black room and not being allowed to be on my phone with headphones on or have the tv on she would go to bed around 9 sometimes 10 pm
something did not feel right in my soul i emailed as i could just type my feelings on wednesday he read it and confirmed my feelings he does not think he can be with me
i think americans tend to be more traditional and fundamentalist but my parents church was very much aimed at young people
is overdosing just lame and should i try another method again not asking for methods but i would gladly like to know if the percentage of surviving this is super high and i will just fuck up my health
bye love i am going to do laundry then i will head off to work you can stay home i insisted on going
i started cutting myself but putting up a smile to my sister and her newborn child she was pregnant at 16 and i have to suck it all up and be strong for everyone
i have been neglected and failed by my agency though i feel like i am the problem i feel like i ruined every opportunity i had to get my shit together and be a better person
all the while i kept telling her that i would leave her alone if she wanted me too and i would let her go
it is my fault that i kept pouring myself into her palms even as i watched all that i was a leak through her fingers
but at the same time i feel like it does not matter after i am gone thoughts feelings and so on will not matter anymore
and family and friends are just nothing i do not know what to do with my life anymore its been a long time since i was contemplating suicide
i do not ask for much of the world but i have not touched another human being in 11 months there is a kind of madness in that my region is extending lockdown and it is not like i have any kind of relationship so who knows how long it will be i can not live like this i do not need movie theaters and packed restaurants but i need to be touched and i have not been and will not be
the past few weeks were filled to the brim with excuses of why i should not shower this day and instead wait until tomorrow nah i have got too much work nah i really want to do xyz after waiting so long nah i could always do it tomorrow when i was really just looking at excuses because i did not want to expend any energy
for many of us whether it is due to mental illness family issues or otherwise the holidays can be a very difficult time especially with this global pandemic it can feel particularly isolating this year i am struggling hard so i just wanted to reach out here to anyone else who may also be having a hard time
we i could start writing pages of the stress the depression and the overwhelming sense of dread that i am feeling i could post them on facebook instagram or reddit but the thing is nobody cares
why my depression is still bad i do not know what to do i do not hate her for anything i hate myself for reacting this way
you know what they are going to get wrong and we would rather sign up to that than sign upto the fact that now we do not have this person and we are now in this no man or womans land and we do not know where we are going
so my friend who is 2nd cousins with my son and i got into an argument because i was looking for a house in a different state due to better school system
actually i do not be sad most of lat time with hercos buddy who is drop you in first hole you strucked its bad budd but actually
my ex has always had a crush on me since we were kids but only started dating my senior year of high school
she stared lettingng me know when she had extra leftovers and snuck me a 20 here and there i felt bad about taking it but i did really need it
things got bad because of both our own personal childhood demons i have been getting therapy since and really working on myselfacknowledging what i did wrong in the relationship
i also work with him for the time being but it has not been too bad when i see him at work as of yet
i want to bleed a lot honestly i do not care if it kills me i just want to focus on something else hurting myself makes me feel better it numbs me for a while i already relapsed recently so its not like i am ruining some clean streak i want to bleed so much
in the past i have had an abusive relationship that affected my mental health and that thing made me search for therapy but it stills torments me
i know what to do how to fix it but i just can not here is my problemhow to deal with a breakup the ultimate guidehttpsmentalstyleprojectcomhowtodealwithabreakuptheultimateguide
but over the worrying in general i my hair has fallen out and i am only 25 can not have a meaningful conversation as i can not concentrate on anything else other than thoughts
oh did i mention i am a firearm owner i had to stay away from them for years until i trusted myself enough to use them responsibly again the entire experience has destroyed that i can not even enjoy one of the few hobbies my dad and i shared
i could imagine that it would not have been any different with me you are going to think about them at least and you will check up what they are upto
i let him know that they had been talking about getting together to do something small for halloween and he was like oh okay
instead of going directly home i texted her and called her telling her i do not feel well and bought a pint of ice cream and headed over she lived on the way and had given me a key
_ i even talked with c about it a couple years later and he was like oh yeah n was a total bitch
i have never been a crier but on these medications that is all i was it was 4 months before i told my psychiatrist i really am failing with these medications
to make matters worse the constant snark directed at my wife has her in such a state she does not want to do anything so cleaning the litterboxes all of it falls on me now this enviroment is destroying the one healthy relationship i have i am growing to hate her too
anyways the girl in it was basically explaining why she had no friends her experience and it really resonated with me
edit i am like crying good tears from all the support dudes i posted this last night when i was really contemplating selfharm i just want to thank each and every one of you
if this is the case i will find a way to get a gun and end this shit i am not going to spend my life on reddit crying about my problems like all my previous posts
i am not talkative and hate socializing but i wish i had genuine friends i have literally no one to talk to every day
literal screaming and crying about i do not consider their feelings i do not feel like myself anymore i need real help and suggestions i do not want to be like this
it was the first time in my life where i felt like i could be both my worst and best self with someone
suddenly after she texts me a few tips i suddenly feel overwhelmed and start crying and gasping i was so scared i did not know what was happening i had nothing to be so upset about
ok first off i am set on asking her or confronting her about it please give relative answers and please do not just say you do not or get over it and move on
i have not told any of family and friends yet owing to i do not want to spoil their christmas and now i am here on the fucking internet because you can not give me a hug
i ended up going to a school therapist and they tried to help it did not work at all but she was really nice i only ended my sessions about 2 weeks ago when we got the 21 session mark it is normally meant to be 6 i still feel like i am worthless useless useless unwanted and so much more i still harm myself although no one notices
he dumped me out of the blue last night he said that he enjoyed my company that i was amazing and kind and brilliant but there was not a spark something was missing for him and he could not pinpoint what he still wants to be friends i want him to come back
it feels like for me christmas has always gone down a downward decline it is not magical and what is to be happy since my life has been a tragedy after tragedy
they are nice but we only talk in the class we have together then they go off and do their own thing and we occasionally msg each other on snap
i do not really know what i am asking for here but i just feel so losthow can i do this how did you do it if you have
i once saw a post saying someone needed my help i wanted to be their friend so badly and if you see this i am sorry negative feelings are not a joke and i am sorry for not being available often as i get swamped with work and if i do not keep up my marks will plummet i do not mean to be selfish but i really am sorry
it does not matter who my parents who i hate or my friends who i love if i can not killnmyself right now i want to at least kill my presence around other people i want to be left in complete peace all on my own so that i can learn how to do a simple thing like take a fucking shower at a proper time again
just stay strong everyone it does get better he cheated on her with me i have never treated her like she was my pet
if i started smoking in the age of covid would my life expectancy even out less lonelysmoking or would i die even earlier still lonely smoking i wish someone would do a study
then it hit me that a lot of my time has been dedicated to daydreaming about being a part of a group that impresses anyone i have ever know
13 do not have motivation or energy to do anything feel a little numb want to sleep all the time just feel really down and tired of living
his ex also reached out to him in that time and it helped him how i was by his side and then he told me he does not know what he even saw in her now and how he was putting her on a pedestal
if i had the willpower to work on my schoolwork i would yet i barely have the ability to wake up in the morning
i try not to think too deeply into my other self yes i separate my major depressive disorder self from my own self
bringing it in with verbal and physical abuse he is constantly talking to other women i am so alone i miss my family i miss having peers
basically every relationship i have been in i have been cheated on and lied to all my friends expect for one lie to me and do not really care about anything but themselfs
i am just so over this year i kind of want to go to sleep and wake up in a few years when hopefully we have some normality and i want to be happy i do not want to be sad anymore
she told me my younger bro was going to laugh at my pathetic assi am only a peace of meat to experiment for him
i have tried reaching out to the state for help but i do not qualify for any kind of benefits currently music seems to be the only thing that is here for me
the closest i got to a relationship after that was several love notes that each got systematically rejected one by one
i do not know man i just do not know what to do you get so much more awareness on what can happen
the second i held my little girl soothing her as a mother wouldi originally felt so much relief when i realized i could end my life now i am apprehensive
i have recently posted a post on rdoesanyoneelse and i am not even sure if i did the right thing i know this might sound weird but i am currently going through something that i am not too sure is real or not
i hate myself acting before clarifying but i hate hurting my wife if she leaves the phantom of alcohol that is loomed over my shoulder for years wants to comeout
so do you have intrusive thoughts if so what are they plz sharei spent 2 days watching a friend who had suddenly started to see things and hear voices
he had the medical exam that day and they told him that he had to come in again after a few months
the intense mental abuse i have endured from many different people has left me unable to have a sense of self or trust people or other things
at its core these sorts of toxic positivity i am exceptional mindsets do not really heal your low selfesteem they just help you avoid dealing with it
but this fascination with humans carries out onto real life and i find myself thinking about others in the same way i do with the secret people in my mind
if anything this time away from each other about 3 weeks now has made me realize just how much i love him and vice versa
i am in college i had to take some semesters off because i attempted suicide twice i am 23 now i have been in therapy for 4 years and i just can not find joy in anything
instead i feel alive living a day that does not make me feel lonely but instead each day i wake up i repeat this damn cycle again
he is still around wanting to just be friends but he is fallen out of love with me because it is easy i am entirely unlovable
it always feels like i am not being heard or i am being disregarded when we talk last night she brought up something that she should know bothers me and acted like it was nothing
i know it is stupid and we were not even that close but i had wanted to be a part of their family had given him xmas presents every year etc
my 16 year old sister hates me has not said a word to me or even speaked to me since late september
i can not stop beating myself up i read somewhere that analysis of actions is good but it also leads to obsession and anxiety
then in october he went drinking with some friends and ended up with severe covid i did everything i could from checking in every day to getting him groceries and other little things
we had a talk about those things later and to me it seems she only every acknowledges me during the night she would not post me at all only where we were which was something she never did before but she also claims that she just wants to be aesthetic for her posts and claims that its not because she does not want people to know that she is with me
i can not enjoy anything anymore i can not even imagine anymore i just stay in bed watching let us plays or in the forums reloading pages or in second life idling in empty sims and talking to no one
that is the part that hurts the most mourning that future with him i still find myself suffering from that loss
i do not have the strength for this anymore i have been trying and trying but goddammit why is simply living so hard it is not even a fight to enjoy life it is a fight to endure life
again he is a good person who monumentally fucked up and he has taken all the things i have said and done to him and is still so kind
i am trying to be what he needs and not what i want i do not want to be selfish i just hate feeling this way
the man full of love whose mind and heart shake me to my core in your love i find peace as every time you leave my breath quivers in your wake
6 bottles of vodka to choice from and about 9 other types of alcohol i plan to slit my wrist with the bowie knife i keep by me bed
will this end eventually it is unbearable what can i do any thoughts i thought this was werid but thought that it was ok after 5 days back to back together
i am being held by sting but its string none the less i have since deleted the app i did not do this because she was 17 but rather in spite of that
obviously in these moments i was very upset but not for me only for my family as i knew this would destroy them
i really did something to myself but luckly i had a friend at this point i was over her as she became trans
this year there were people who helped me i was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life
we spent all day sunday together i then got home and he text me saying he did not want to be with me anymore
i have no hope left of getting a real life i am just done and i will always be cheering for your success and praying for you cheers
widowed twice in the past 4 and a half years first to lupus the second to covid because he was working 60 hours a week trying to support us because i can not work
it is a good job and i like the people i work with but i can not escape the feeling that i am dragging everyone else down because of my inexperience
i figured i would find some people on here that are currently sharing this experience i am looking for supportideas people have to better this situation
i just need help to stop thinking like this because even my bf has said he hates it when i think like this and i told him i know and that it is exhausting thinking like this
the things that fantasy can do is to normalize what is psychologicaly unbearable thereby inuring us to it in one case fantasy beautifies the world in the other it neutralizes it susan sontag
the best thing for me is to be alone it is what i want no one nagging or checking in no one getting after me for not taking care of myself
if that all goes tits up i know i want to do some more travelling before i go we have such a long history of being fuckheads i want to know who to curse on my way out
i was in and out of the hospital and therapyrational brain sais that things are changing but its going to take a while
as a sidenote i have had a pet theory for years about how people decide to commit suicide based on what they feel they are lacking in their lives
i am so out of touch with people until i question whether i am even human or am i actually just some ugly smelly horrible being that sees itself as human but really am not
i am afraid that i will always have these scars to others who have selfharmed in the past how long did it take for your scars to leave
we have only been edating for a month and we are already getting into little fights this can not be a good sign right
35 am right now and as i type this my grandfather whom i love more than life itself is being carted to the hospital in an ambulance
i really ruined my life on top of it i really miss this guy i will never see again everything went to shit
yet another piece of me still believes i love him i miss the comfort i had with him that spark was gone she was not angry or hurt or upset
he looked like he was so in love with me the way he looked at me was eye catchingi can not even see myself in the future
will i ever feel the sudden embrace of your touch will i ever lay my hand on you again the darkness swallows me more
i stayed at his flat for a few days there he has been treating me really bad hostile i would pretty much consider it bullying
i was not at home there was the time and then only homework until it was time to go sleep i know they are not going to turn up to dinner on time
ultimately i feel trapped like the road has ended and this is all there is on top of that there is a good chance i am gaybisexual at the very least and it leaves me pretty confused most of the time
my instincts tell me i do not want to go everything i know is in this statetoday i wrote a message in my journal with my own bloodmultiple times
but also i should not mention the spiritual stuff nor criticize any of it which might just drive him deeper into it
when people who taunt me by calling me my dead name i cutlol i hope one day i cut deep enough because fuck this shit man
basically the only source of meeting new people for me right now is making livestreams on a polish website which sucks because due to loneliness i rarely have the energy to engage with people that freely
so conclusively stop nagging your ex start healing so that you can meet someone 10x better in the future i know this is not what you want to hear but it is the uncomfortable truth
i have tried to commit suicide about a month ago but i do not have the balls to do it i am now open for suicide ideas that are peaceful and painless
xrays on my lungs find it is a very bad pneumonia xrays on my left leg which was unbearably painful find it is a fracture of the femur
my thoughts have been coming back and now they are constantly there very repetitive and gets continuously worse i wish i could say i have turned completely numb from it but i am beginning to feel very tempted i have been feeling worse and worse and more disconnected than ever i keep thinking about how to justify my own death
the last attempt was supposed to be certain the drs were confused as to why i survived i think i bought some dodgy seeds from amazon
she explained to me that you always have yourself and need to love yourself first which really made sense to me
before i went to bed i blocked all his friends and promised myself i would never let him upset me again i have been trying so hard to get over him and i was doing really good for a while but now i feel like i have fallen back to square one when all you do is think about him and wonder what he is doing
after the breakup i told him that we can become friends still because we have a mutual group of friends from grad school but i think it was not easy for both of us to make each other out of our lives
so one day while i was at work she called that i needed to come home as soon as possible she already had an miscarriage before and since the beginning of this pregnancy she feared the child would not make it so i raced home and she showed me that she had an echo that morning it turned out after being pregnant for two months the children did not make it it also turned out they would have been twins
maybe its what heroin feels like after she left of course i got super depressed as usual except today something went completely different
because in the end they would not have hurt you in the first place in the end it would have worked out like it was supposed to
but the thing is i do not want to change i loved myself when i was positive and i can say people liked me more as well back then
she had a very unhealthy fear of abandonment and she had no healthy ways of managing that i am here to ask for advice as emotions i feel are a bit too much
anyway for some reason she thought i was going to come to her house for christmas my dad works night shift and is working on christmas so my siblings were going to her house she freaked out and got in a big fight with my dad that i did not come to despite me repeatedly saying that her house
i have had a few close calls in the last 2 years i have begun to think that people who want me to stay are the ones who are selfish
i am not alone anymore i have a girlfriend who helps me and appreciates me and i know she needs me too
she offered me her bulbasaur keychain so i could remember the good times i rejected it i told her i do not want anything to remind me of a girl who does not love me and she choked up walked back to the driver seat and drove away and since then i have never messaged her never reached out to her and am making a deliberate effort to never look up her social media accounts
today on christmas i was lucky enough to be with my family and i am so grateful for that as i know not everyone could be especially this year
when we focus on what our mental health issues are vs who god told us we are and not being with him or following christ it will make it worse
i have been pretty depressed and suicidal because a lot of things that happened this year i tried to do things that i enjoy to try to forget it but it is getting too hard now i am not happy anymore i am tired of putting a crooked smile to seem like i am okay to my family but i am not how can i admit myself before i do something stupid please help
i take a while to open up to people and i tend to hide my emotions behind humor i got out of a really toxic relationship november of 2019 and it took me months to really heal
i still live in the tworoom shared flat that i moved into 5 years ago yesterday i realized that i did not change anything did not even replaced one piece of furniture
i still have some of her things at my house and she also has some of minei swear i can not take this anymorei do not need replies like there are a lot of girls
in reality the idea of a porn for loneliness seems literally impossible to me it is just where my thought process went
i screamed at her on the phone at the hospital and i called her a slut out of feelings of betrayal
i used to be very cheerfull happy and crazy person before depression and anxiety really hit me after some family issues when i was 17 and since then i feel like something inside me just died and i can not find it anywehre anymore
i just want to be gone it feels like i am existing just for others i am not really living i am done three days later i woke up
ever since online school and other personal stuff i have been having a lot of mood swings even though i can not control them i think i am a bad person
although it had been 3 months since our breakup it was also the month we had first met each other it was month i gave my all my purest love to a stranger nostalgia memories are flooding back
as we talked and connected she started talking about one guy who she still has feelings for and talked about stuff she did with him
my self esteem is very low at the moment maybe i need a little back support thank you so much for reading this chapter
and right now i just do not know what to do or feel anymore i am literally just crying onto my notes while barely making it just going through all my notes with red watery eyes and snob all over the place but i can not give up because i can not afford to fail my exams
ok so i will give you guys the best context i can remember yes there are more important stories out there but every story is weighed differently to each individual and i apologize for the writing i just really wanted to get this off my chest while it is still hot in my mind
i guess you will know it when you feel itmy girlfriend broke up with me today after only a month of dating
let me start off by saying i am so ashamed to be this young and not enjoy the life i am given someone else could do better job at this whole youth thing than i
i am taking that as hint that there is nothing he wants to discuss about anymore so i am going to carry on and this time i will not look back
i truly do not feel like a human in this fucking house my parents invalidate my feelings so fucking much that i can not handle it
where he was a man of faith a nondenominational christian i logged into my social media as i would logged out just after she dumped me
today i am 17 every fucking situation that i experience causes me to panic every fucking thing i can not bear being anxious panicked depressed and deep in my phobias all the time
i do not want that but hes just in so much pain this is the one thing i could do to make him so happy but its so painful
but ever since this pandemic happened i moved to the countryside as well to be with my family and i have been enjoying the solitude so far
just slowly losing hope i barely get to touch an hold my kid now when i come home she always take him an goes in the other room or asking y i am home so soon or on weekends why i am here an y i am not out with friends
is any of his behavior justified and what do you think of all this do i have a right to be upset
i am now pushing myself to grow and looking at what i can do with the experience my story telling my love for video games and my thirst for life
so far it is all been mainly online bullying but i have encountered lighter versions of it at my own work and places i deliver to i have got bills and a pickup truck payment to make but as an admittedly not so macho guy i feel like the overly alpha world that trucking has become is just making this job more of an issue than it has to be
the way i was treated dumped 3 times by him after my little girls death broke something in me that i do not know if it can be fixed
interestingly enough virgins and losers like myself and promiscuous women can and are really natural allies against the irrational stigmas that most societies have about losers and whores
she told me my ex never had an opportunity to party or go out with friends that this was just her embrace of a new life with a new job and friends
i am not sure if i am posting is in the right place but i have to ask someone for advice at this point
i may not understand each individual and each communitys unique experiences but i understand how to support people through grief and i understand how to hold space and i understand how to know when i do not know and how to learn
you do not want people like that in your life so as a mature man do not try to win a person like that back
shit i had more to say but i do not really remember what it was i tried to keep this as pure to my thoughts as possible so if you actually read this god have mercy on your soul as this entire post probably did not make any sense whatsoever
you can hear in my moms voice when she says the date that things are weighing on her but my brother 5 and i are giggling and singing putting on a show for her completely naive
maybe i will start posting some videos of me playing singing soon just trying to gain back my confidence self esteem self respect little by little
you close your eyes imagine having a virtual conversation with them that is right virtual unreal convo i know you do it
i tried to improve myself to read books to try to think more rationally and to communicate more clearly so that others can understand me better but after years of trying it still seems fruitless
fear that you will not fills my core with agony because then that means that we are truly over i do not want to be with anyone else i want it to be you i want it to be you
i am a 16 year old girl i do not smoke drink or do any delinquent activities and i have never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before my mom had severe ocd though
it is been 5 months and my life has spiraled out of control and i am just a wreck all the time and i can not get this knot out of my stomach i miss her so much but she lied to me about everything it seems i do not know what to do
they said they were really happy for us that we will obviously have some decisions to make but they believe we have this
i am struggling with some seriously weird feelings that used to be infrequent but the last few days are constant nothing feels quite real and everything feels alien even though i am home
you know what i mean just two old people without energy ultimately living lonely lifes together everytime since when she would go out with them i was an anxious mess
i wish you did not need to be alone to figure it all out but i guess that is something you are choosing for yourself
would not it be sensible if that script would find its way to the ears of the beloved without a hindrance well fear is the reason
i would love to know your thoughts about this thanks for readinganyone have any strategies you have found to make things better
but like among depressedanxious people is this normal what could this mean have you seen doctors and nurses crying while you tell them your stories
whenever i talk to her she just talks about her own life problems and tells me how i am so nice to listen but then when i do something wrong yells at me how useless i am
she would go blank when she would get mad all these years i hug you sleep with you cuddle with you etc out of habit
so how can i know i like something if doing it gives me no positive feeling i can perceivei have never sought therapy or counseling for any of my issues
the one that enjoys just having you by their side and listening to you dreaming about your future together like listening to a beautiful song on a friday night
every time i see a group of friends or a couple i feel incredibly sorry for myself and i am in a depressed mood for the next few days
he said i kept talking about my exes which i did not realize was a huge deal he also said i kept saying he was going to leave
i loved them and i can not help but feel like it is my fault i know it is not and i have no reason to feel guilty
my ex and i had a distance relationship she recently moved to chile from venezuela and lived with her sister her sister was going to london for a few days and she was going to end up alone for christmas and new year

my sex drive is not too high but hers is up through the roof i like to workout do boxing and cardio and i would rather save my energy for that lol
i am being stabbed again and again but i will not die all i feel is pain you wake up do nothing for most of the day and then sleep
he is currently seeing a therapist but he is not comfortable enough to tell them everything i just want to hear one time i believe in you
in the two ish hours we spent together i think i maybe spoke to them for a total of five minutes all the rest of the time was spent with them talking to a random stranger
working for the allowance of distraction not they pay i can not say that things would have been different they just seemed inevitable
yes it was a very shitty time of my life but i rather be depressed than in denial i tried a lot of breakup solutions that i read about but they never worked
about a week ago it came to the point where i blocked her on all social media and deleted her number still have it on my mac
i feel like i do not even have the time to be sad anymore because i have to move out i am scared of living alone
i do not know i am not going to do anything i just needed to rant so if you read this thanks i guess
edit i do not know if anyone will see this but if i do not respond i am probably asleep not the other thing thanks
the one you would go in the car with and sing until you break the glassthe one that would encourage you to be a better person
also if you guys can help me try to find some closure it would be really great i do not know what i am doing
i want to give him his space and not communicate for a bit i am just a bit heartbroken he has not reached out to wish me happy holidays and wonder if he is happy without me
it is been a year since my shitty ex and i broke up it was pretty miserable and i have yet to get over myself
there we sit down and her bed and says that she does not think it is fair to me that she had mood swings and that she needed to figure out what was wrong with her
i do not want to put my self out there to be struck downanymorethere is a such thing as getting over too many things
i do not know what is wrong and its starting to scare me and i do not want to feel like this anymore
my dad has had cancer for 12 years and he is going to pass away soon and it saddens me a lot because he is the only one that used to defend me
i always had an hard time making my ex gf come so it was a huge boost in confidence we then realized what we had done and we promised that we would tell no one for a while
this was my biggest issue being together and it really touched me he recognises this behaviour and took the effort to apologise
all her and our stuff reminds me of moments from when we were happy together from our trip to mexico to together looking out the bathroom window to the sky
it is gotten to the point where i am not even upset or distressed or worked up i am just emotionally and mentally exhausted and done with life
they all come back running my way like they need to tell me something in fearsuddenly my phone rang i answered with my headphones without seeing the callers name
we broke up because he was too busy for a relationship but still sort of share the same group of friends
at home i feel incredibly lonely i like pokemon it might seem silly to say it but why should i not
like i have already tried to convince her to talk to a counselor but she did not i have tried everythingboth my family and my ex have told me to go die and i feel so fucking betrayed
they have never hurt her or screamed at her like they did to me and the first time i attempted suicide was when she was 6 months old
but anyways last night i was in bed and i could not sleep and i was just feeling kind of numb and i had this sheet thing and i put it around my throat and pulled
my god that girl makes me feel things that nobody else can the peaks of joy and the pits of misery
but the only girls i have had sex with are the escorts i have paid i feel like i have given up and i am becoming bitter or even evil
no one wants to talk and in a time of great change mostly private in mental and physical form none of my friends in the dorm at home or anywhere else as if i had been isolated in a chamber
i have been strugglimg for 21 years and this is the best i can come up with god dammit how is this the best it gets
i had a psychiatrist appointment later that week and told him everything he decided that in addition to beginning dbt to manage my bpd symptoms that zoloft would help me feel less depressed
they may not use the word replace but they may say i do not know who i am anymore i do not like who i am anymore
i will either pace around my house lay in my bed or sit on a chair and live in my head for hours
sometimes it really hits me that i am alone i am in college and i do not really have any friends the ones i do have 3 i never actually see anymore they have moved on and i am happy for themi lie in bed and this wave just crushes me and i feel like dying i am so confused i have been alone so long i do not know how to be with people
well if there is anyone at all i am comfortable talking these subject to start withit is almost been two weeks since you left
the following website has links to phone numbers and websites for anywhere in the world for help lines just select your region
i lived with undiagnosed depression all my life and within the few my diagnosis in the winter of 2019 i was referred to inpatient behavioral care and stayed there for two weeks
the nature of my essential job as a truck driver is driving me nuts and off the wall i have been doing everything in my power to stay safe and keep from being infected by this virus but i seem to be encountering more people in my line of work that do not care about getting sick or possibly dying
i always tried to work it out because i loved him and i do not give up on people especially ones i love
and now i just do not no what to do i just can not bear the thought of never talking to him again bc i still love him and ik i always will
i have no one to talk to family always says i will love you no matter what but it is all fucking conditional
i had anxiety and depression before i met my ex and when she entered my life it kind of cured me but when she left i was at the lowest point in my life
i can not decide what to do and even when i do i really do not have the motivation so i am just lying here which is probably making everything worse
i have fucked up everything i will never get what i want and need in life at least it feels that way life is so difficult exhausting and painful i am sick of the anxiety fuck it all
some days i am very tired of having this pain in me and there is nothing i can do but to think about it and cry
watching how to be alone was so representative of the overwhelming loneliness i have also felt during quarantine like there was no one for support being alone can be really scary in so many ways check out httpswatchargocomhttpswatchargocom to find how to be alone and feel free to leave feedback here
i have been told to leave the min i pulled down my pants after being with this girl for 5 months he laughed and said the s are not going to work and i should go so she can have her friend over to fuck her
i have got no shoulder to cry on anymore i lost my friends and i do not want to annoy my ex with my bullshit
tbh he would get irritated and kind of go off on me a lot to which i forgave him every time he apologized
i feel like i do not belong here and never had a chance right out of high schooli had a mom who was 61 years old
anger was her primary emotion and she handled every situation the same way she was rarely sad there was no depression and she was either neutral happyecstatic or angryfrustrated
this person has quite a long history of mental health and substance abuse they refused help every time it went down hill and they were brought to the hospital
and now i am feeling desperate to connect with other people besides my family well i am not really sure how i should explain this story considering it was pretty simple
i just do not know anymore as of now i am currently in the kitchen i have not touched my food yet and i am still upset about what happened i feel like i just have to tell my dad but then i will just be a bother to everyone in new year i am scared of what will happen to me and everyone around me
i have always been trying my best to be as kind as possible towards others and in general it really takes a lot to anger me i know that often people say and do stupid things to others and to themselves because of their own pain and suffering
i can not do it anymore i have been hanging on for so long taking it one day at a time and everything just keeps getting harder and harder
i know it is morbid and like whatever but yeah i just panicked and did itokay family when i fucking kill myself we will see who is attention seeking
however for her distance was always the problem knowing that she went overseas to study we were still able to see each other around 5 times a year
i have no one here my friends have all given up on me though i will never give up on them
i always snap out of it immediately horror and amazement quickly setting in that such thoughts would even enter my head
i am trying to lose weight and keep up at the gym i am trying to in general improve my life and gain more control over my world
i will find myself in my bedroom in a friday night and i will hear the laughs of tipsy young adults walking down the street and realise i have not gone out into the nightlife in months despite being able to where i am and i feel like i am missing out on really living and enjoying my life
they only recently decriminalised suicide over here but mental health is still a taboodo not get me wrong i still hang out with my friends
i do not really want to do this because it feels shitty sending people after her but i do not want to be reminded of her ever few months
i want to be loved and to love i want to hold and to be held by someone i want to feel another bodys warmth i want to feel like there is someone who understands me completely and accepts me for who i am and whom i could make feel the same way about me
because she thinks it is funny to see me get upset this has been going on for many years and i have been having lots of problems with it but i kept my mouth shut since i felt like it did not matter if i said anything
and it makes me happy its my only way out i am glad i see it now though instead of giving myself false hope i can not wait to end it just thinking about it brings me joy its the only thing keeping me going anymore
i then write i do not like how are conversations have felt really different and she does not respondi text today saying a joke and sorry for texting you so late when i was drunk
the pandemic has wasted my career i am married to someone i am fairly certain is a narcissist and i just do not have the energy or will anymore to leave i do not want to start over i do not want to rebuild i just want it to be over i do not really want help or medication or anything
the most significant step you can take towards selflove is to accept your flaws and embrace them and be willing to show them
i just feel like i married him because i love him so much but he just married me because i let him do as he pleases and he does not want to be alone
all my life i have the feeling that i am alone and do not belong anywhere i do have friends but those are acquaintances i can not say anything about that
focus on yourself this storm shall pass and god will open up doors for you i just rly rly need someone to talk to rn
he went out with her like almost everyday meanwhile he did not ask me to go out too he always said that he is busy and can not go out with me
i wish i could text or call you right now plus situation in my home is not good i lost almost all my friends and i feel so lonely
i would like to hear some thoughts on what i should do how long i should wait and if i should bring anything up with her
sometimes though i just want to lay on the floor and cry because it is been so long since the last time i was genuinely happy and excited about something
broke up with my long term partner of 6 years in may i am still reeling from it this is the first christmas without him and i do not know how to handle the sadness
a friend of my family died my guinea pig died my dog died my best friend broke up with her by of 3 years and started cutting herself came to me with all her problems my gf and i broke up and now the undcle of my father died
it is like i can see myself spiraling down and have little control over it can i put an end to this breakdown i do not want to see how low i can drop
i do not really know why i am writing this in the first place but i want to feel happy sometimes at least for a brief moment which i did not experience for a long long time i do not know how to improve my life anybody else on the same boat
no one will even carecrocodile tearsi am never anyones first choiceno close friendsnone of that shitit is not their faulti have a shitty and toxic personality
but i still did it i do not know if i can be around him as just friends i am sorry if i am over sharing in this group
who knows how soon i will die given my new chronic illness there are no words to fully describe it the hopelessness of it
my point being lately i have been feeling the disastrous feeling of distance and unsureness of any existing friend after telling you and reliving a recent experience
i am thinking about writing an apology but i do not think it is a good idea also i would like to read redditors comments thanks
the following weeks i tried to avoid her i could not see her knowing she was texting with this other guy ect
my friends family situation was bad so i did my best to get him out of there we even slept on the streets together
i lost a lot more than just him i think that is why i am hurting so much i had to move back home where i do not have many friends nor a job in my field being with him felt like i was still tethered to that life but now i am just floating aimlessly i am very very sad
tw car accidents depression mentions of suicide and cuttingmy 16 father 47m was in a car accident almost 25 years ago summer 2018
that ten minutes i do not have to use on that can be spent cleaning up after the cat or folding the laundry or some other thing i did not get to because i am doing the one fucking thing i asked him to do
than he told me he jumped off a building knowing the people in my life does not even care about my existence makes me wish i was dead
actually i first asked him to apologize to me because while i get people can lash out when they are stressed i also think that they should be able to apologize to you
second my academic performance has decreased drastically and focusing on one thing became difficult however i feel there is potential to it as in my free time i read publications across different disciplines and able to grasp fast
i have had suicide ideation nearly every day since then but am yet to make a serious plan however i did write a note which is no longer relevant and i should rewrite
our life in the past 9 months has been filled of unprecedented times chaos but has allowed us to be given a sense of time to sit with ourself sit in solidarity
i say this because i really good at keeping it vague in irl i am good at never explaining myself and leaving it be
as a context the first girl i have been with during highschool left me for a business mans son who could buy her everything she wanted
yet i can not stand the thought of someone else seeing her at her most vulnerable state and having sex with her
it is been six months since we lived together and it is been the hardest six of the past year but not the absolute worst time of my life
she put me on a different medication for adhdadd but i also so do not want a relationship not only do i not want to be a burden
i know it is been four months but i still miss youi have done bad things in our relationship and i know that
it is never too late to meet people people of all ages meet others in other walks of life and find connections i may be feeling a bit isolated and less lonely than others but it is all a shared existence right now and there is a lot of empathy to go around cheers
that i literally let people treat my bad and that i pay too much attention to peoples behavior towards me because i some how love being angry
i recently remembered that i had a lots of difficulty to socilaze 2 years ago the main reason for this was that i was very busy at this time
they hate me why should i make them hate me even more do i really need to specify that i mean it in a friendly but not romantic way
a few days after they had officially called it quits they had a big fight she called me and was very upset according to her he called her and she had casually said hey babe but it was followed by awkward silence where she could feel him recoil at the other end of the line and so she had confronted him about it
in a nutshell you need to be able to say so fucking what to the amount of selfesteem you possess because only then will you open yourself up to the possibility of genuine selfimprovement in that aspect
why in the hell are you really over here and the 2 years i spent with you were hell i interjected with yeah that is why you stayed in it for so long
though it is difficult to completely clarify the motivation of patients with munchausens syndrome it is generally agreed upon that the pretender feigns symptoms to receive affection and care
i have been in love with this person for over 5 years and i find it very difficult like anyone other than him
there is a sophisticated feral like quality to us educated exvagrants of broken homes we conquer our challenges like they were made for us to step over
wtf is wrong with me i have lots of friends but why do i internally not consider even one of them as my friend
i know that is a long shot and i know that creating and maintaining active and thriving community is a very hard thing to do but i want to do it anyway and i hope some people out their want to be part of it
her breaking up with me was never permanent and it always felt like i had to prove how much i loved her in order to get her to change her mind
the trouble i am having is not wanting her back as i know it is over though i wish it was not it is that everything in life is up in the air i am still looking to move and get a new job i have resolved some mental issues so hobbies that used to interest me do not anymore so i have lots of empty time and then dealing with the relationship ending
the past few days my anxiety has really subsided and i can officially admit to myself we are over i no longer have an allconsuming anger toward my ex
i chalk it up to her drama loving friends and my promiscuous reputation it preceded itself but not by much but honest i really just wanted to go to prom with this girl
whenever i try to talk about this the conversation just tends to drift somewhere else if anyone has any kind of idea about what this might be about please share
it is the day after christmas and i am in bed with my new fuzzy throw blanket with my new candle lit and smelling up the room listening to music on my new speaker and i should be grateful
the second time we dated it was only 6 months later and she was 24 maybe she is not avoidant at all and she was just young immature
this is a new level of pain i think i can not continue he is going to be another fucking asshole who hurted me and never is going to have any consecuences
i do not know how long i will be able to go on like this but i feel a bit better knowing that i was able to get this off of my chest before i make this decision
yesterday we had a small conversation about the fact that he is not feeling really well with his feelings he said that he does not know why things do not feel goodright to him and he feels a little drained but it seems like he is not recovering
she is the meaning of my sorry bitchass excuse for a life and the only reason for me to keep living this sorry bitchass excuse for a life in hopes that she will become real one day if my sorry bitchass excuse for a life is absolutely nothing but infinite purest suffering god knows that i would do my best for at least her life to be normal and even good if only she was real and was mine
anyway my mom somehow equated my lack of enthusiasm during christmas to me not liking any of my presents or not liking christmas in general but for me i think it all boils down to my depression
it is strange because it is a person she is been friends with for awhile and does not even seem like someone she would be attracted to
whenever i do benzoes i realize i would really like to have this peaceful feeling always i fantasize with having the whole thing and just cut my veins
i am not ruined because this person lives very close to me and giving the police the complete evidence of a lot is i guess soon to httpsiimgurcom8nbepsijpghttpsiimgurcom8nbepsijpg
as a former smoker who saw smoking as both a friend itself cigarettes were always there for me and as a way to be social i am wondering now whether it would make sense to start smoking again
just now my brother ate everything he did not left me food to eat for lunch and dinner i would not do anything else after 4 years of ups and downs i was able to control my urges
i miss everything about him his voice his eyes the way he used to dance the way he used to laugh the way his face used to light up when he talked about things he was passionate about
i am currently in a situation where the relationship that i am right now has reached a high level of toxicity so we both want to end our relationship
now the question is what can be do in this kind of situation is it even possible to have my father forcibly taken into care if he lives abroad apathy does not seem like a wise plan although it has been the preferred course of action for the last 10 years
i have felt it all my life that terrible yearning for female companionshipto love and be loved to have someone to share the joys and the burdens
and i am wondering how can i not be so jealous about it this man used to love me so much
even his housemate said that she had never seen that side of him she also wants to move out as soon as possible as she does not feel comfortable
i try to explain him so much but he does not really care he only wants me when there is hospital checks which now he requires due to long haul covid
and they wonder why there are people who support populists it is all because we hate these people and we wish they were all dead
i am so lucky to be surrounded by the people i am surrounded by i am regaining my self worth and i am thankful for it
i tried to tell some of my immediate family but it did not really work i know when i tell them they will treat me differently and that is another level of pain for me
i am a physically disgusting person and this is just even more exaggerated when i am standing next to my underweight tall friends
i feel like i should be able to handle my shit but i just can not anymore i struggle to find a reason to keep going
it is hard to find the motivation to do things i know i should do to make myself feel better everyone says just sit with the emotions and that is what i am trying to do
i even experienced walking out twice bec it feels like i am alone when i am with her bec she is sooo silent and keeps on fidgetting on her phone
i lost contact with him at that point and never thought of him ever again up until 6 months ago when i was with a mutual friend of ours and i asked him jokingly how is he doing expecting to hear the same old answer that he is doing drugs and stupid shit
i love painting writing and exercising but i find without socializing i quickly lose my will to do any of those things
to die to sleep to sleep perchance to dreamso me and this guy been best friends since grade school 11 years
i am still in my teenage years so i have so much time on my hands to sort this out but i do not know what i am wanting
its like test of godly game or something and i have no idea why me i can not see the final target so i told him i want to leave the life but hes never talk what is next means what is probably he is me from future or something or from another world and after death ill be him
it was my first big mistake some weeks after that i found out that she was talking with other guys the whole time
people who are upset and vent out at people calling them the worst things and trying to make them sad is pure projection and it is a way of earning attention
i have not had a conversation with anyone else in about a year now since the pandemic started have not had a steady job since february so i have not been forced to interact with anyone else for more than a couple of days at a time and even then only for strictly workrelated reasons but that brings me back to that little story of the bike meetup
due to the time sensitivity of the current job for the winter season it is 7 days a week 6am8pm and i have been pushed to my absolute limit
he basically very cold and callously told me he was not in love with me i was unattractive and had gained too much weight and that he could do better one night and it was all over and he would not budge and basically kicked me out of our apartment and tried his best to give me as little money as possible
him doing this is pushing me away i get i am being harsh and that most people would kill to hear this from their ex but i am not one of those people that is not what i want and i have been explicit about that but he keeps saying it because he feels he needs to what about what i need why does it feel like no one really cares about me
i have never shared this for fear of to being institutionalised but ever since i was a kid i just fade out and daydreamfixate on an alternative life where i am a police officer other person in authority and i am saving the world person i am attracted to etc
when my finest work that would make any english teacher bow down to me was finished i gave it to her personally and told her to open it in a week
gosh i am exhausted but just had to share hopefully it helps one of you all too i feel like i do not want to do anything i literally do not have any will to do even my hobbies
i begged her for another chance to try again and that i will find a was to stay with her longer but she did not let me try to fix it
count your blessings say thank you for being allowed to wake up today to start new give it your all and leave it all on the field its the only way
christmas just passed and i was alone for the first time it was a weird sensation i was sad but i knew i needed to snap out of it because i know your not coming back to me
it really sucks because this year i was thinking how finally i could celebrate my birthday with my friends and this time i would get birthday wishes
i really do not know what to do maybe psychotherapy is not for me i am crying every night because i feel like i am so helpless i feel like i annoy everybody and no matter how many good things happen to me i still am left with that emptiness
i feel like i am driving everyone away by accident i think it is because i might be clingy idk if i am actually clingy or not
i am impulsive i do things or say things without putting any thought into it i am always aware after the fact but i can come off as really rude sometimes it comes across as i am not empatchic at all and i do not care about what i say its like i do not know what i have done wrong
i want to die i constantly feel like i have reached my limitthis study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088i
what i do know is that there really are not any reasons to live and if i died no one except my family would even notice i am gone
i sat through it quietly i wish i could say i thought of the drive as a way to say to goodbye to him
ps i used to have a near addictive relationship with video games until a year ago and for past few days i have this urge to start it again
s he said come on there is nothing wrong with you they are pretty upset and they do not understand how one could live at its parents house at my age
i ended up eating a ton of pills and drinking a whole lot of gin and did not want to live anymorei ended up blacking outinstead of dying and got a duicops found me passed out in my vehiclei had crashed in to a fence and was outwoke up in jail and had no memory of what had happened
i would stay in the hospital for 3 months my psychiatrist and nurses told me i am the sickest patient they have ever seen
isolated on my own since nothing but four walls to contain me and a screen to keep my eyes glued to nowadays it is between staring at a blank wall or looking at a blank tab hours pass until i am reminded that i hate the present moment just as much as i hate my memories
i can not even do anything because of this quarantine other then try to call her and text her not to do it and she just ignores me in the end
its not like i do not love myself i sometimes get too self obsessed infact recently i went from obese ti fit within a year
it was pretty stupid to think that way i have nothing wrong happening in my life it took me about 34 months up there to truly get over her but one day it just clicked
we spent a lot of time together and i could tell something was off but kind of ran with it to see if maybe it was something that would solve itself
they were my family now i have no family or friends only my wife it is that i still feel like a teenager in my head i am not grown up at all emotionally
i do not have any irl friends i am married and usually only hang out with family i finally decided to make online friends on discord and it was going great until it was not
i was diagnosed with mdd anxiety and chronic ptsd i am 15 years old f and am a sophomore in high school i have been a straight a student great at art but other than that there is nothing else to me i have been on antidepressants for a couple of weeks and i feel extremely numb
him really then people are just liars to meme yeah idk who told you that but it did not happen or it just was not with me
fast forward again to him going up to check on the food and this time i followed him because i knew
i have been attenting gym since the beginning of december in order to reach such a fitness level where i would simply look stunningly
i have slept for 3 or 4 days straight this week just because it hurts so damn much it took me a while to actually fall asleep but i managed to go back to sleep as soon as possible every day
like why would my ego push me to speak to my ex when i know logically for a fact that this person is no good for me it will hurt more and it actually damages my ego itself because she chose someone else over me
do you believe it has potential to revolutionize the way we handle mental health or is it overhypedi know that in general frequent crying spells probably indicate mental health issues
also i used to write but i hate my characters so deeply i have killed some off and i dislike writing have been writing for over 10 years and i just do not know anymore
i genuinely do not know what to do and it is so frustrating i got to this point i do not know if i need professional help or if i am just being lazy and need to figure myself out the good days i have really make me feel like i am faking the bad ones i would really appreciate any advice support or anything that could cheer me up hope you all are doing okay
i was adamant that this week would be the last but my original plan had ground up 250 pills of 500 mg acetaminophen is out the window because i am scared of the suffering how long it would take
but lately i have been getting closer to myself and the dreams have felt increasingly more off like the feeling in coraline where she is with her other mother and family and i am getting really scared to slipping away into that with it becoming my reality
but i can not help but feel something was wrong with me that caused him to leave i gave him everything i was so good to him
two years ago my best friend killed himself everyday i would be on a discord call with him playing gta v or csgo one day his parents called me after he was pronounced dead after having a overdose
i had fantasies about suicide for years but i never actually planned it i think one day one of those evenings like this one is going to make me want to kill myself but not today today i will just open another beer in hopes i will ease some of the pain
most of my depression if you can even call it that comes from insomnia and overthinking etc and i feel that if i had someone most of my problems would go away
i 26 f got married two months ago i have been with my husband 29 m for three years and i love him dearly shortly before our wedding we moved into our first home which we built brand new shortly after the wedding we got a puppy and we already had two cats
solution so we built serendiphttpsserendipco serendip makes it easy to meaningfully connect with new friends who genuinely share and resonate with your core values
i think i am so smart and have a lot of things to offer the world just him i have no one and i miss him i hope i can just accept being alone
i do not like crying in public with anyone seeing me i never did i always preferred to be alone in my weakness times but now it is different
i was really confused because i was thinking about him the whole time i would like to know your opinions if this is judt my imagination or whatever it is
i miss him so much and i genuinely think that this is the guy i am supposed to marry it is officially 3 months since we have broken up but it feels like an eternity
during around the time of our breakup it seemed we were trying to figure things out until everything imploded when i found a polaroid picture of her kissing another guy which ultimately lead to me cutting her completely off for 2 years but not really because i would respond to some of her texts and some calls which i know is dumb but i just had a soft spot for her because we had gone through so much real life things together
i have never sexted before this app let alone do it with a 17 year old and i have not done it at all since
the only person i feel lifted my spirits the only person who knows me on a level deeper than anyone else
compulsive eater and food addict gained 70lbs this year up to 510 210 pounds will eat to the point of needing to vomit literally every chance i get
yesterday she looked me in the eyes and she said that she cares about me but she can not offer her love to me anymore
any helpsupport would be helpful i am a very anxious person so please do not tell me to just get over it there are factors at play that do not make it that easy thankyou
this all i do not realize i mean my craving for physical contact or company in my room when i am sitting in my empty room staring at my computer screen drinking my protein shakes and masturbating as my mind is pretty busy but when i go to my parents at the weekend and i try not to cry before my family and tell them everything
i will try my best to remain productive and love myself i am just confused what is been going on with me and do not know what actions to take
i was devastated it felt like he was hoping that i would forget about meeting up and came up with an excuse
i have no reason to go on without my kitty to love who i could not even protect from a monstrous narcissist
if i do not say hello they will not too sometimes they do not even reply me and last few weeks they barely reply to my goodbye
i tried talking to other people but they all just seem to want hook ups and not real connections i tried no contact but the second i deleted him from my phone he began to call every day
i had a dream i was diagnosed with cancer and i was so happy because i had a reason to sit down and just die
each point represents a side creating a cube of which if you do not relate to or have most of these educated guessesqualities you will most likely end up failing at every turn just like me
i lost the love of my life in 2009 when she passed from her disease 6 yr ago my late gf cat died he was 18
i often tried to be a better partner to her and i worked so hard on being the best version of myself and my primary plan after my graduation was to get a decent job to afford marring her
everyday i want to send her a text because i still do not want to get over it i question my self on things i could have done better
the conversation went fine at some point i have to drop off his christmas presents honestly i think if i do not i will just want to even more
but i am faking right my mom says it is all in my head that i am too young to be thinking like that it is because i am always on my phone it is because i keep locking myself in my room it is because a messy room indicates that i do not care about my moms generosity of giving me shelter
i listened to her and i started to change my bad habits into good ones i was willing to change not just for her but for myself and so i did
i have a facial deformity and people treat me so badly it is not even believable no one cares i get treated like dirt and do not do anything get called a pussy stick up for myself and i am evil and will probably be in trouble for it i hope the fucking world burns
i do not know what is wrong and it makes me scared and angry and sick all at the same time and i just hate it
but in reality he was he did not love himself and i loved every single part of him that he did not love for himself yet i am the one who was betrayed
i hate this i am trying everything i can to get this feeling out of me but i can not just seem to get rid of it i can not stop crying i can not stop thinking things
i am really tired of being here this year i tried for the second time to commit suicide and failed another thing i suck at i guess ever since i stopped actively trying to i said hey maybe there is a reason but it is still the same crap
i guess as i fall more in love with him he is falling out of love but can your feeling change just like that he said he is been feeling that way for 2 months
i no longer talk with most of my previouslyclose friends ever since we all went off to uni it kind of seems like everyone is moved on
i used to text him and he always ignored me or his texts were always distant everyday he used to add new girls on instagram and facebook only latinas
i love my parents and i have a sweet sweet boyfriend and an ok brother but i can not do this anymore
it hurts me but i do not know why i feel so empty like i can no longer cry like it is an extremely numb feeling
after 6 months he convince me to move to him and be together i move to another country with my son
i feel like i am just a burden to the people who chose to stay in my life and i am constantly worried that sooner or later i would lose them as well
or send me a video in which you eat it that would be fun but right now i need my space and i need my time to heal
he came around to the idea the same time i regretted the fact i suggested it we ended up breaking up in september i was willing to fight for us he was not
the last ones sound pretty embarrassingstupid the more i read them but those are the ones that keep happening more often considering that we are in quarentine since the middle of march here in my country
we were could not wait to spend time with one another and it was beautiful you gave me so many memories when i least expected them to happen
and i still had this tiny voice in my head that he does not really want meall i can think of is do not want to die of loneliness and somehow survive
i have been attacked on reddit by younger people who told me i must apply for disability because their neighbor got it or some lawyer told them how to get it
also with everyone being cautioned against large gatherings in canada this year will be just my partner and i he left and arrogantly threw my belongings in a pile in the middle of the room
so if i said to you do not think about your break up what is the first thing that comes into your mind
i believed you could do no wrong that you were a saint you said you hated cheaters they are disgusting sad excuses of human beings so said you
her friends are no help either for me but that is expected what do you guys think are her parents any help or will they only make her dislike me more
flash forward almost three weeks now and i ran into him he looked happy calm and like he had his shit together it reminded me of the attraction i had to him in the first place and it tore me apart i know i should be happy for him and how he is doing but i feel sad and confused
she was always there when i was sad stressed or angry she would do this thing where she puffed up her face and it was so damn cute
i wanted to ask if anyone knows how long does it take for a therapist to give a diagnosis for something like bpd
she has always had these extremist views that change every couple years i am not talking about someone that is super leftwing or right wing etc
i felt like a complete mess like my life was in shambles i have never been a crier but on these medications that is all i was
recently a female friend told me to reach ex and say i love her after 3 weeks of silence i wrote
today i feel like a combination of extreme anxiety and extreme depression i can not figure it out and i do not really know how to explain it to a therapist
i asked why and she said she was scrolling through her blocked list on insta and saw me personally i doubt that as her requesting to follow me happens to be on the month of our four year anniversary well what would have been
i wanted to support her in starting this new chapter but i felt like i was not even in a relationship at a certain point since she never talked to me
then i heard her hello mom i do not know her name which is strange but i knew she was my child
for example i may want to watch a movie and i will start thinking that in the past i may have made a promise to gods not to watch that movie because ocd was telling me to watch it as part of the compulsion
it is hard to take care of your body when you sometimes feel like you do not care about yourself that is how i feel a lot of the time i feel like what is the point it is hopeless i can barely ever get motivated for a workout these thoughts prevent me from being able to concentrate on my workout
so he was not around to assist me or split the responsibility of taking care of our mother together at 18 i did it myself
whatever you helped me out in a lot of ways i thought of your piano playing today and how beautiful it was
also because of this i physically cannot have children i just always assumed it was a natural part of life to grow up work marry and have kids
she is so beautiful and i miss her telling me how her day was as it was my favorite part of my day no matter what her answer was i reminded her i ask because i care
i have never really been invited to a wedding or large party only ever small coffee visits i just can not help but feel like it will never happen for me
i have never ever ever been on a date most of my peers have been on a lot of dates sometimes with more than one girl
i am a workaholic trying to prove myself in this new career and new industry that i have wanted my whole life
for example the essential actions such as journaling mediation keeping a somewhat stable social life daily exercising and a good diet will go a long way in helping you recover
kind of bored so feel free to drop your woes your worries concerns and maybe i could offer you a bit of advice
got her guy friends to threaten me said i am stalking her for wanting answers it just was not making sense to me
i feel like i do not even have control over this i hate my head there is this sinking feeling inside of me
i want to do the big bad because i want to see who my death would touch and i would want to see who would come to my funeral and how they would cope without me everyone would be better off tbh
however i feel intense loneliness while working and studying i just wish i can have people by me who are working or studying
we gave each other an appointment for the next year to see each other in the eyes and be sure about what to do if we really want to try again or not i do love him and i have this gut feeling that he has not stopped loving me he just did not have the mental space for it
she never returned after that the funny thing is it was me who told the care taker that my family were talking about her
anything that allows me to die without having to do it myself i am not killing myself they have already done that for me in every instance of neglect
and i want to say one last time that i love her thank her for everything and wish her only good things in life
i guess they would prefer people in pain to go to drastic measures and leave behind traumatic scenes or better yet let us tie these people up in straitjackets
i just came out of a 2 yr rlts 4 days ago we go into more depth on the it gets better issue in this psa posthttpswwwreddit
if you are having a hard time with motivation check it out hang in there and keep doing the things i think it is time
i have developed healthy behaviors like cleaning my room and doing laundry once a week showering brushing my teeth and flossing daily
i do not know if i am ready to erase all of you yet thoughin 7 days its my birthday i will turn 22
obviously i am still thinking and able to do things but i struggle to have thought doing whatever i may be doing
it is been only these thoughts and i am tired of fighting it they won i really tried to love myself and to believe i was not useless but i failed
this was confusing as i did not talk to her for 2 weeks after the breakup and we had only started communicating in a friendly way and catching up as it was her birthday recently
but one thing that i have learnt over these months is that you can not really forget a person you can not forget the love you had for him at that moment your heart can ache at any minute even after months and years sometimes and that will not mean you are not over them it is just that you learn to live a life without them and you move forward gracefully making new memories and meeting more people
it worked amazingly but it is hard to use mindfulness meditation to help anxiety when the whole thing is about watching your thoughts but i deal with something that comes up in the form of a feeling in my head
his sister and all his friends liked it and now i feel so embarrassed and silly for being so open about my feelings
along with that there are many things that i need to identify so when someone asks about me i can know a little bit better what to answer and maybe i can share my passions too well i have to know what they are first
its been so long since we spoke it feels like i am single and seing as this is my first girlfriend ina while i do not want to push her away like i have done with the others
i still have this hope with me that she might reach out since we are doing no contact but i know she will not i hope that we will find each other again and rekindle our old flame but i know it is very slim i hope she realizes that she does miss me and the way i treated her but that i cannot control and i know is pretty much impossible
but i have just been really depressed the past few days i can just look at the wall all day and just be sad
i do not like the idea of a long distance relationship across an ocean so we have agreed to just be friends for now
i think what is making this worse is that everything pretty much hit me right now at the end of the year where i am slowly getting to know each and every one of my emotional problems
and i am barely aware of my surroundings i can activatey high conscious but eventually i zone out again after a bit
sometimes i feel super aware of what is around me and every little noise and other times it feels like nothing i can not see even exists
or the beginning of a life where i will be a bum homeless at 18 broke a druggie i do not feel at home in my hometown or any place i have been so far
i am finding it hard to move on because he lied to his mom why i broke the lease when i left he was left with all the bills and she hates me now
i do not want to see them the last times we were together it felt forced and i felt lonely being around them
during quarantine i have been feeling pretty lonely and having friends to talk to is pretty nice there are tons of chat rooms and topicbased forms like eating disorder support selfharm support etc there are teen and adult topics and the site is separated between those aged 1318 and 18
i have no friends no close family no one to tell me they are glad i am alive and no one to tell me to be happy on the anniversary of my birth
but for who i guess family abroad and charities i probably would not give my brother a single cent since he is the reason i am so fucked
this morning while i am at her place both doing some work all of a sudden she takes my hands says come with me and leads me to her bedroom
i tried but do not think i will able be able to accept happiness got close but have come to realize it will come to an end soon it was just an illusion it did look real though could almost touch it bought some rope and learned how to tie a noose it just felt right not today but soon enough
and go to her country i did not know anything but i remember that for years he had her contact on his phone
today i passed the threshold of writing loneliness in the search bar i am writing this at 1 am been trying to fall asleep for over an hour but i just feel like an empty vessel barely feeling anything
that i should not exist or that i am the main problem in the situation i am trying everything i can and i hope you all can help me
our love first started off strong we were could not wait to spend time with one another and it was beautiful
i get to see a friend on the weekends but even she bails out on some weekends and i end up feeling like the weekend never happened
so i started a 2nd job at a game store about 3 weeks ago its kind of a dream job because i love board games and models and everything we carry and talking to people and helping them find a board game they would like is genuinely rewarding
i will try my best to make this as short as possible i am dating this guy for what is now a bit over 6 months
i should have stopped it there because i take this kind of thing seriously and i never stay good friends with exes
it is been an issue for a long time but it is started to emotionally get to me i feel everywhere i go friendships never last and it is really hard to find my place in this world
i made a separate account for this post to avoid people looking down upon me i wanted to go see my family one last time for christmas and did that
i never had high or even mediocre expectations for christmas anyway but somehow you managed to ruin it i got myself in the situation where i promised i will leave my toxic relationship for you before the end of the year but every time you remind me it just makes me remember how i would rather die than break either of your hearts
well i accepted him and we moved to england i just wish i could forget i wish i could move on
he was not invited and i was over at my grandparents along with my parents and my brother to help set up our little christmas dinner only us and my aunt and cousin all socially distanced of course and i saw a grey head walking up the driveway
and another friend whom i talk to almost every day on facebook took a giant shit on my feelings the second i opened up to him
it was a wonderful beautiful relationship at the beginning but then after covid started and it all went downhill things were great the first year but after that the constant bickering started
when i moved i found friends but we were not that close not as close as i was with my previous friends
i began to severely regret leaving my ex gf during the course of my new relationship and when i do feel something it is often anger or sadness
i can not even communicate what is wrong and it is a hard feeling to describe i want to express myself but it is too hard
i hope you hadwill have an okay day today peacei have a couple friends people who know everything about and are close
what should my expectations be here my personal circumstances are not going to change anytime soon so any change will be chemical
i feel lost dejected and hopeless i had 9 months to make the woman of my dreams like me but i failed
i could take a lot of drugs now but its not always a guarantee death sadly this idea will have to wait since i am still in college and living with my parents sucks that i can not just dispose of myself so easily
out of habit being with you is great but i want to try to be happy without you i feel like i have compromised my mental health for the sake of nothing
it just feels like they are prolonging the inevitable death all of this is not cheap either which makes me think i am a burden
last night i had a dream that my friend looked me dead in the eye and said he is not coming back he is moved on and it broke me
do you like that thought of course you do not like that thought do i like this shirt no i do not like this shirt
my mum died when i was a kid her aim has always been to get me out of my dads life
so me and this dude we will call jim met on hinge in september hit it off agreed to go on a date which turned into four
her anger issues have gotten better and she does not physically hurt me now i have also gotten a lot prettier thanks to puberty so people do not bully me for my looks now
so i will have to wait until next week to buy the bullets and it would have been shitty to kill myself on christmas anyway
i tried so hard to find a reason to live for in this world but it does not matter what i have right now or whatever i will be receiving in the future its all temporary
simple can women tell me break up wit there men ever think about there ex1 year 2 year ect after
but then monday came around and he just said he was unhappy and i asked why i am so torn as to whether or not i should take it
everyday i wake up anxious and have to distract myself via my phone i just feel constantly trapped and i just hate myself i do not want to leave my friends and family behind i know they would be devastated but i do not value myself really at all and i do not see a future for myself really
have you noticed that its socially accepted to gang up on the quiet person even if those people think its cowardice to gang up on somebody period
when i was at the hospital i could not sleep neither could he so we would sit in the lounge area and talk
title really says it all there is no real help for me rn all the therapists in my network are booked up i want to kill myself i hate my family christmas sucks etc
long story short i still think about him and miss him every day we were never exclusive and i am not sure if it is important or not but the last time i saw him i met with a guy friend of mine who wears a lot of perfume i hugged him and when i got into the car of the tinder guy he immediately told me you smell different
my girlfriend 24f just broke up with me 26m a week ago today and my god i just cannot stop dreaming about her
to make matters even worse he told he wanted a break he never officially broke up with me now he is saying he never ask for a break
i honestly do not know why i did it or if i cared about dying this was one of the lowest points i have ever had and i told no one
my life clearly had no value and my death will have no impact i was just a group of atoms on this earth for a second then gone for the next
these times have been difficult these times have been challenging but with challenges comes growth with things that question our comfort zones that question everything we have always known comes a realignment naturally and organically it all takes time and i am grateful for the time that it takes even if sometimes i want to get there already my dysphoria transitioning
i have nothing i am a botheri hope you are happy i spent hours and hours and hours talking about you to my friends
i was not expected to live had it in march when they did not really know what to dowhat was happening so she thought why not go steal her shit she will not need it
also if i get a bit of water on my pants from washing my hands i will think it is pee even though i saw the water go on my pants
i am about to sleep and thought maybe reddit have a space for a talk that even me does not want to hear goodbye and goodnight
every day waking up is a new challenge every memory gets drifted into a new dream although the memory stays the days with you slowly grow older and distant 2 months just now feel unbearable it is hard to know that you are happier now than what you were every couple of weeks is a new pack of cigarettes with 30 more reasons to just not care anymore
he ended up twisting the whole break up onto me and saying he did not want to be with me anymore and that this is for the best and acted like i should be really sorry and it was my fault
i do not deserve to be alive and i do not want to anyway i am disgusting ungrateful and the worst person that has ever existed
in every other game i am incredibly scared to really interact with other people from the community like lol or rocket league or i think nah it is not worth it making contacts because i will not play this game for too long
ultimately i know that i must give her respect and space but i am also thinking i need to talk through everything with her and get a fuller explanation perhaps offering to go to counseling to make this work
i am not the person to be like i asked you so you have to ask me now but it would feel nice to feel a wanted enough so people hit you up on their own
am i overthinking this does this sound like she hooked up with another guy she told me i was the only guy she wanted and that she was not going to go out and look for that but i am just worried and scared please give me some advice
i am constantly anxious for the future this january i will have to go back to our home and he will be there too
do i keep an eye on him or push to remove the guns that is fine you can take ownership of them take responsibility you can improve and grow
i am working on identifying my own triggers by journalingit is been helpful in understanding why i respond the way i do in situations helps me process and ground the emotions and i think helps me prepare for when i encounter similar situations in the future
i lost the one thing that was keeping me going i can not remember the last time i felt genuine happiness i have not in so long
but we made the best of it she went off to college in september and things were going goodi have always felt a lot lonelier during the holidays but more so this year
when i posted on amiugly and saw the other posts getting more comments likes and attention than mine i felt like nobody cared
what is sad is she said she cares about me but feels like she is just using me for attention and emotional support she has depression but i think she really does love me and want to be with me but with her depression she feels unworthy and that she will ruin the relationship idk with her mental health i new she could be unpredictable but i can not help but loving her no matter what she says
1 question on my mind is if you will text me tomorrow wish me a merry christmas i already can see how that conversation will go
i have been trying to channel my loneliness into making music and my summer classes i am rotting away and i have never seen the light of day i am 20 and i can not not hate myself
today while on the backseat of the car going home from vacation i was thinking about how i would like it if an accident happened and killed me before falling asleep
we decided to start looking at houses and furniture and talk about what our plans were it is like somehow these people were the chosen one i have never ever ever been on a date
it feels like i have the worst luck in the world and i just need a way to be with her already i do not know how much i can hang in there
i will hang out with her for a while then i will go home and run some errands or going to the beach or something and after a while i will end up running out of things to do and i will end up alone in my room
jump forward to today and i still have nightmares basically every day orange lights now trigger horrible anxiety attacks and being alone at night is absolute hell i get extremely anxious and start overthinking what would have happened if i did not wake up my family being my family tells me that i am overreacting and i should just accept what happened
so fellas i now know what it feels like to never want to just go outside i was a snipers delight in chapter 1 of fortnite
to top it all off this has all taken a toll on my job performance and my motivation to be a functioning breadwinner and financial coordinator for our family
a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time this can depend on many personal and situational factors
i am in my midlife now i did not have any fun or good times in my 20si am so inexperienced socially that it is hard to communicate in my retail job
the guy who got his arm blasted in kenosha was her ex before me and apparently they would been talking during and after we dated i found out they had sex late september and it absolutely destroyed me
i wish i can tell my friends my problems but i would just tell myself i am a burden and that i am troubling them with my dumb problems i honestly wish i can just end this all and not exist anymore
as if he knew it he texted me first on that friday and asked if i would be free on sunday
yes tired of being alive but that does not have quite the same ring to it i had a relationship for over a yearlong with a guy
meanwhile her friend had wrote something with hearts was personalized ectwhen i reached out with a big thank you she just says np hope you enjoy
tldr ex dumped me on my birthday and said some nasty comments during the breakup it invalidated the whole experiencr for me but made me realize he was dragging me down and that the whole thing was a waste of time
then he told me that his family is not happy with me and that they told him he should have kept the ring that i mostly paid for
i always believed that i messed up with my life but today i got sure i went to a reunion with my old classmates
i found myself in a relationship with a 20 year old girl after i broke up with my ex i will call her s
after almost 3 months constantly talking to her one of my friend told me that a senior has also admitted his feelings for her and now they are in a relationship
also she never messages me or anything you can be sad but whining and crying all damn day is not going to change anything try to cope
1 big thing that use to set me off would being out clubbing with my friends and watching them all get with girls and me being completely hopeless at it rubbed salt in the woundsnow that i am not in those sort of situations because of covid restrictions i do not feel as bad
i never pressured him to meet my family or my friends because i know his confidence was suffering i was supportive of his expenditures even though i knew he should not be spending money he does not have
and i do not know i just want it to stop that internal voice can literally talk me into a mindset i did not have at all it will invent worst case scenarios and then i end up feeling like shit and thinking the worst of myself
as we drove off my neighbors watched in shock i was transferred to a meritus medical center suicide ideation would come maybe once every few months then once a month
my mom and disabled older brother i have always lived with both also moved with me as my mom wanted to move to the main land for a while and me going to college was the perfect reason to finally do it
i am almost about to graduate high school and i am so numb to thoughts of relationships how can you not fucking care how
she needed to talk so i got up the zoom call and waited for her to get on when she got on i knew something was up she looked like she wanted to cry
it is this feeling of sorrow regret anger disappointment and pity that i do not think will ever leave me i was barely alive during that time
my parents forced me into therapy which i have always hated i have had suicide ideation nearly every day since then but am yet to make a serious plan
we then barely spoke for two weeks he told me we were still a team and we would be okay etc
i am disconnecting myself but then wanting to reconnect questioning why i am feeling this way feeling confused lost and completely detached from everything
i deserve to be hated that is why i am going to never talk to anyone anymore unless i am required to speak ever again
while i do know that my depression is what sometimes makes me feel like i am not participating in life i can not help but realize that even when i am not depressed i am just weird
and all i can think about is getting on a dating app and talking to new people even moving forward to new friends the cycle continues
can someone tell me what is going on i do not want to commit suicide but i just do not want to exist you know like a peaceful break from everything
my parents do not like that i have been lazy but the truth is i have to distract myself all day because when i stop or when i lay down at night
the next day she skipped me the entire day and the day after that she broke up with me helping kids helping anyone
we have been together a year and a half and have lived together since april i am a midtwenties guy this was my first long term relationship
i do not know if the normal times will get fewer and shorter will it get harder to go normal each time even if there is an excuse
how can i love myself enough to keep going so my bf of 2 years and i broke up a week ago
i do not want you to be in a position of just hoping things are going to change and hoping things are going to disappear rather than just trying to distract yourself this is a much better way of trying to deal with it
i freaked out about a fucking youtube video an hour ago i really want to get out of this mess but i do not know how
merry xmas and stay safe watch your loved ones close i wish someone was here to watch mei am high i am drunk i should really just blow my fucking brains out hahaha why am i trying
for context i am a 13yr old female my gf and i had only dated for a month and a half she was online fyi my first love i am not taking it well idk it just all sucks ig
i do not want to mess this up but i am really not sure and not readymy ex and i recently broke up
but it is dawned on me that is not the case at all you just do not care and do not want to be involved
even tho we accepted them for who they are and wanted to go for the rest of our lives with them and grow old together
so having to come to the realization that i am not going to have kids and have a family i am not going to have grandchildren and ultimately i am going to die alone has taken a huge toll on me and i am more lonely now than i have ever been
i know it was the right decision and i have ignored their messages for over a month now but today i just genuinely miss them we were best friends and i could just talk to them about anything anytime without feeling judged at all
i explained why i emailed her so often and that i also spammed my freinds so i picked my things and i left leaving him with in the silence he always wanted
034httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat34s home is where there is joy but also comments about my eating 148httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat108s is christmas a good time to talk about my binge eating with my family
i always make an effort to be a good person to her and i always talk to her through the stress of college and her job
my wife starts to worry because i am slowly become a isolated person that do not want to get out and socialize with people i understand her concern but i feel comfortable and in control this way
long story short i have tried having a relationship with women from my world for many times 10 at very least and each and every single one of them turned out to be a hateful asshole each and every single one of them used me to achieve their own purpose while mistreating me like a piece of fecal matter and then betrayed rejected and abandoned me it was starting normally each time but then they were realizing that i am a spineless dickshit who is constantly afraid of slightly offending the last bitch of the universe and cannot answer even to the worst wrongdoings done to him and then this happened
i just feel as if i am alone in this dark world i fear for my life and health i have never felt so down and depressed in my life i just feel as if this is my safe spot to post this and if i do end up ending it all anyone reading this just know that someone cares about you
sometimes i think i can like when i put the gun to my head the house was empty and i just wanted to feel something anything eventually the fear came and i put it back down on the counter
the thing is i am an ex con i have the mind set of one and i refused to file a statement or report my own injuries
seeing everyone around me mature find love and generally be successful in their lives while i do nothing and fail at everything i do hurts so damn much hell i can not hold a job down especially with autism i can not make a relationship last longer than two months because i am incapable of saying the right things and i am just an all round ugly unattractive idiot who does not deserve to live anymore
i know that a lot of people go through things worse than anything i have ever been through but holding onto that idea and telling myself to try harder only made everything worse
but what happened is that i relied so much in him it started taking a toll on him i am not depressed anymore but i am still pretty insecure
i am on 21 so since i was a teen i have been having her use me as a venting spot to just complain about her life how much she hates my dad etc
if you feel as if someone in the household is struggling go and have a chat with them make them feel important and worthy what should you do bring out a board games play some cards say those incredibly awful jokes inside the christmas crackers stick a dvd on
where did i go so wrong i just want to be held by someone he did not say those things just to provoke me
growing up i lived in a really abusive household i have since moved on from my biological family and spent years recovering from the physical abuse i spent a long time dealing with what happened to me and how the violence affected me
about 3 weeks ago i had to reach out to her to give her back some documents i found she left behind at my house
why is it that whenever i make any mistakes or do something wrong i am now deemed a failure to be cussed at like i am garbage but when i make big achievements i am now deemed a treasure to my family i seem to get less praise than our own dogs and they never seem to bat an eye that i may have things wrong with me
after about an hour sitting on the bathroom floor i got over it it was not until my dad cancelled something on me that it all came out again
i deserve recognition and an apology and i am trying to come to terms with maybe not ever getting that but i just want to know if i will ever get that satisfaction with him
she said one of her siblings and her dad does not like me i asked why bec i never felt that when i was with them
i sent my final message on facebook messenger telling her that i deleted her phone number so i can no longer drunk text her i asked her if she can block me on all social media so i cannot contact her anymore and that i will do my best to forget her and focus on myself because this is what she wants and i just have to painfully accept that even if i am against it
what if you do not leave for that job what if you moved closer to me what if we did have a future and just did not see it yet what if we made a mistake what if we were meant to be in love and just did not have enough time together i keep thinking about having more time with me
my mom worked her whole life to give me and my bro life and i totally appreciate and am forever grateful for that fact
i think this also contributed to my distance pot usage and general discussions with other girls these girls either were annoyed by me or they wanted to sleep with me
but maybe space is what he really needs right now now we broke up i suppose that the reasons are not too important in the scope of this post
my throat clicks when i swallow i randomly started feeling dizzy almost all the time over a year ago my sternum cracks like a joint every time i stretch my arm out wide my upper back and neck muscles feel like rocks my shoulder feels like it is going to snap out of the socket when i bring my arm down from being raised i have heart palpitations constantly and all of this leads me to believe i have some deathly form of cancer or another super rare disease that is slowly killing me
i have pushed so many close friends away so they could not leave me first because i was convinced they would without any reason
everyone says just sit with the emotions and that is what i am trying to do but i am wondering how long this stage of grieving lasts
we loved each other deeply but my depression made it hard to be active sometimes along with quarantine but we made the best of it
out of the blue one day we just do not talk at all i am waiting for him to text me and he claims he was doing the same but neither of us reached out
need to clear the loft write it down list all steps everything how would you sell books how would you approach buyers do you have an ebay etc account
i battle depression so at times it was hard for my feelings to surface but i knew i loved her so much and she knew it too
since i can remember i have struggled with issues related to my mental health at different points i have been diagnosed with depression anxiety bipolar ii andor adhd
no more online lessons no more sitting in the background while listening to others it has all become quiet i did everything to avoid school it is no ones fault but my own that i do not have an education
is anyone our thereapologies this will probably be a long one to be honest i do not even know why i am writing this
i just want to end it and i will i do not feel anything anymore maybe once every couple of months i get a glimpse of feelings the rest of the time i am just so numb i think i am done i will wait for this seasonal depression to fade away and i will attempt suicide somewhere around spring or summer when i have more energy to attempt it
her room is half empty and tomorrow it will be an empty white void i feel like a part of myself and my whole future have been violently ripped away from me
so why should i live 70years in pain when i can end the suffering and cut to the end that will come to everyone
i gave and took too much and now it has not stopped hurting i know it will probably get better they will probably come back or i will find someone else but fuck
and this girl is just gorgeous one of those people who radiates charm and then to put a bow on it she is so genuine and intelligent
why is this happening what is the connection between sleeping and eating right before and is there a way to stop it it is the only reason why i can not seem to stick to a diet
that aside i met someone 31m whom i had the most fluid conversation with he shared all my tasteshad a successful careerseemed like the full picture
tldr i have hated my body since i was 8 a combination of comments from my parents medication birth control and emotional trauma have destroyed my selfimage
just to be clear i never touched my dog inappropriately nor do i remember ever touching her with inappropriate body parts
i like it alot but he was like here let us start this up and i admit i did not think before i acted and gave a kind of snarky remark
moving forward evolving progression the path is day to day consistently rather than one day here one day theretldr my dad laughed at me because i am lonely
typing this out has made me feel a lot better i think i am going to take a shower and try to calm down more
that said i have been feeling for quite a long time now a sensation akin to having a deep chasm in my chest an infinite void that is destroying me from the inside
are you fucking stupid those people do not even care oh reddit is not a place for supporti will never be able to change my childhoodjust fucking shoot me or hand me the noose
i found important documents that i kept safe such as her daughters birth certificate a month ago safe from the trash can that my 17 year best friend was determined to trash everything she left behind
what explains this conundrum regret for stupidly pushing people away in my youth narcissism for wanting to be alone except when i want someone around to meet my companionship needs are others like me is there a way to connect with them
so i just have to accept that i am a lazy piece of shit who is incapable of changing so then what do i do what options have i laid out for myself here
then he told me that my condition is not a big deal but the fact that i kept it from him was too much
the following link is a lecture by alan watts about life and all the important aspects of it and how could you understand better if you just do these simple things httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv58ikvduptaghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv58ikvduptag
my ex wife taught me a lot about the things i would never put up with again it became an elephant in the room i was admittedly a little overwhelmed
just do not say it if you are going to leave me on read or just not even look at the message the least you can do is send a crisis hotline number and then just leave me in my misery it is not really helpful but it is the polite thing to do
and now my issue is that i have no one to share my thoughts my emotions my time etc i sit at home during work and after work i just go out to buy some food or order a delivery or visit a boxing class i really want to express myself to someone maybe it is possible to overcome the pain by some means different from actually finding someone
for the past few months i have been experiencing hallucinations of her i see or hear her everywhere i go we were flirting there was chemistry but i botched it as well she did not choose me
i deleted not deactivated so it is gone for good i was not very active on this account other than to use it for facebook dating which was crap for the most part
i only follow close friends and things of interest which really just means cats other cute animals so the whole selfesteem comparison issue was not a thing for me
i have had conversations with people who were not real or maybe they were but i do not think they werehalf the time i feel empty and half the time i do not feel real
what is the because for one to have suicidal thoughts i have been having suicidal thoughts in last few months and in last few weeks i might have just realised it
but despite this i have even redecorated the room for her i am currently studying and while it is strange to be living alone it is not really alone but it just feels like it sometimes
what if i am a bad person for picking nice things for myself and not for others what if now that i found out i like girls i will also like little girls
i am a male so it is hard to get anyone to really listen to how i feeli am new here i come because i need some support some help
i texted her a couple of times but she only texted me one word answers i got the hint she did not want to talk to me
no unkind words were said and we both discussed what led to this moment he was kind and patient throughout the ordeal and i was the one who was crying the entire time
i do not want to break her poor heart but it has to be done or it will just get worse and worse
i think what hurts the worst is he is taken the easy way way out and said he needs time he is made himself out to be the victim everything is about his feelings his pressures his insecurities and his barriers he is put up because of the past when actually i know he is not as broken as me or even broken at all that is the hardest part
just fucking shoot me or hand me the noosewhen people who taunt me by calling me my dead name i cut
i can not tell my family because they have always judged me in the past and treated me badly and told me i was selfish when i told them about my mental health so i do not trust them
i start from the beginning to give a better context last year i startes a new course artistic met new classmates and so on
but most peoples idea of what being happy meansand i must admit that it is not what i thought it would be like eitheris not at all the crazy thoughts i had about what peace felt like
but i can not stand sharing energy with people wow covid has really made me quite antisocial send some love and advice pls
that i loved you i still love you and i am scared that i always will perhaps the holiday stress is getting to me
who knew a global pandemic could bring me so much happiness when it comes to my mental health i miss you so much
we broke up because with us being long distance with your job you kept missing me so you decided to shut down and start being cold
no jokes some friends afraid me cos of thatnow i have 15 exams that i missed or failed and about 10 tasks to do i am failing
i am ignoring everyone until the holidays are over because i want them to at least have a good christmas so they can have something good to remember this year
up until 2 years ago i had a close group of friends and after a big fallout i left the group
so i want to ask you redditors for advice i know it is fairly pointless but i have no one to turn to
i felt like this relationship might have not been compatible numerous times during our relationship but i did not call it quits
people around me meet and get married and at this point i am not sure how to start why did no on taught me that back in school
i lost my friends and i do not want to annoy my ex with my bullshit i am alone again and i knew it would happen
never had any friends relationships and will never be liked by anyone this is my main problem in life but things have being going to shit lately
the things to learntake some a very short amount of time me took twice or more i can not even focus for more than 15 minutes
just for the next half a week to be just as bad again i am heading down a much more promising career path now
fastforward a bit 2018 or so i began to have panic attacks they returned i fought it up until 2019 early 2020
my problem would sound pretty trivial but it is very close to me my class split into 4 different sections each with some people
i hope you find someone you can love unconditionally even if it is not me it is a constant battle between the three of us it is very damaging to our mentalities
last night i went to a party that my ex was at it was for our mutual friends birthday and it was at my exes house he said he was not going to be there until late that night so i thought i would just swing by and say hi and then head out before he got there as to avoid awkwardness
please if you could give me some tips on what i should do in this situation and what to do to move on
but recently i have realized how much i miss you as person not just me wanting a relationship i would hit things my knuckles are scar tissue to this day
but every other week i check your instagram or read your tweets and do the most hurtful thing i could ever do
with his history it makes me really concerned that if i can not help him then he might end up doing something but i do not know if i bring up my concerns about him committing suicide based on his past would make things worse and if he would then be afraid to tell me his issues because i know that he is telling me more than his therapist
2 7 days after the bu i wrote her a letter for my own closure she thanked me for the letter and reiterated that she wanted to be friends after nc
i ask for some discretion however she tells nearly all our cousins and her mom my aunt then forces me to make a shopping list
this is my first time ever making a post on reddit so please excuse if i sound weird earlier this year i think i attempted to end my life
she responded positively and told me to take all the time that she needed and that her and the dog would be there for me whenever i was ready which gave me a sense of closure that i was in desperate need of
during my childhood years my father used to be absent for long periods of time due to work but after an economic crisis which led to him being declared bankrupt he was home a lot and that is when the arguments began
i could be vulnerable ugly and anxietyfilled i feel like a burden to my friends here at home and i am actively seeking a therapist
i remember being a very social kid up until this point of my life because of a speech problem that came up whenever i talked there was this constant feeling in my head that felt like a mini headache but it did not really hurt at all it was not a throbbing pain either it was just there
all my family ever does is bring up stuff from my past anyway i do not get why i am in my family
i honestly feel like if his sister respects a little more than the rest of the family will follow through with example
i am just stressed and coming here instead of unblocking him to send a message because i know that is what he wants and it is silly because he will not respond to me anyway
i am shy and introvert but right now i am just feeling overwhelmed by my own thoughts and secrets i would like to express to someone but there is is like a wall in my mind and i am unable to speak about how i am doingfeeling i do have friends but i never get into deep conversations about myself
however recently maybe for a week probably a little less the anxiety is practically non existent even though both the thoughts and the groinal responses are very much still there
i had deleted all of our pics together so seeing these was really nice after arranging a drop off location for her stuff i tried to invite her to be friends again
now they get you up in the middle of the night more times than you can count you wake up shocking unable to catch your breath because the pain in your chest is eating you alive
let me share a simple technique that i learned from stoic philosophy that will surely help you on your way to recovery from your ex
she was super flakey and dry when texting me during this she was also rude with what she would say disregarding how i felt
i have also experienced almost having a flashback during the last half year i was watching disneys onward and one line just caught me of guard
its not even the drugs that raises their red flags its my way of being so cold to their feelings to the point they think i am dead inside
i told god that i hate him because i do not understand the point all of this sometimes id like to be happy and unknown anything else
just him i have no one and i miss him i hope i can just accept being alone i have been working out more and trying to read more just keep my mind busy
i guess what i am meaning to say is thank you thank you for showing me what i could mean to someone and what someone could mean to me
i regret doing a lot of things i have i wish i could go back and never make a reddit account or any social media
i started cutting myself a while back because it is the only thing that helps and i tried to kill myself a couple of times because i was so just tired
its been a long journey but i am so excited to move forward with my lifei do not even hate the fact that he yelled in my face and made fun of my suicide
british pubs were closed march 20 so i missed out there she broke up with me we both still love eachother but she is starting to bring guy friends over
throwaway because i do not want this on my main account in case someone finds it i am an adult and legally in full control of medical decisions
i do not know what to do or what is wrong with me i feel constantly unmotivated low tearful exhausted extremely guilty and not enjoying anything in life i have lost interest in everyting i an seeing a therapist right now but bot that often since it is very expensive i do not know if i should tell my friends about this because everytime i think about telling them i feel like they will hate me
i do love him and i do see he love me as well i really want to help him but i do not want to be trapped into friend zone i tried to cut contact but he got extremely worried should i send him message i will support him and be always there for him or should i cut contact off for my own sake
i know this is her doing and that there is consequences for these things i am not here to get judgement i just do not know how to help her
i want that so badly please i just wish you would give me one conversation even if it does not have the best outcome
then the reoccurring dream of you going through an anxiety attack and me being there to comfort him just like in real life i told you everything was okay
but i am an unhappy person i got a dog and got off the scrips after the twelfth ineffective onei dk hope that is not too morbid or mean considering i feel that way about myself
you would be so much prettier if you lost weight to him this was a passing comment but as we sat there in my bedroom naked i braced myself for the impact of those words he kept talking talking about how arm wresting makes his dick hard or some shit the worst part was the sex it was bad really fucking bad
thank you i will be able to pay my cell phone after xmas day to keep my phone on for a month
and i have people in my life whomt i would rather live on with for centuries than to ever go through seeing them leave or leaving myself to the bare ignorence of either the afterlife or plain empty nothingness
would anyone be willing to get to know me and help me out so i will not hate life and will not be lonely anymore i am kind of scared of talking about myself completely unless i know i can trust them
now i finally get things together finally i have a goal in my life and enthusiasm to self learnno one is ever there for you when you really need it
that way we can depend on each otherediting this i am sorry i wish all of you to live a very happy life
hey i have been using birth control pills for like 5 years i had it suggested from my doctor due the pain pms hormonal stuff etc
i know this time is difficult for both of us but it feel so bad to see him distant while we used to be so close i really can not get that even if i know sometimes life is fucking chaos
i told him he truly needed to get help he needed to get help and he needed to do it for himself
but i am in quarantine i am scared to meet my own friends now and my father says he is bored and wants to go for gatherings and parties
sorry if sounds stupid can not post this on rnostupidquestions since anything related to suicide is not allowed therei can not eat i have not had an appetite in years
when i was setting the ring tone i was excited i would done all of this independently and was choosing a ring tone i would be happy to hear something that would make me feel like i was actually eager to talk to the person on the other end
i honestly forgot why i even decided to start writing this maybe because it is christmas and i am feeling awfully joyful and celebratory
i have never been good at expressing how i really feel about something i feel like i can not talk about my emotions without either bursting into tears or steering the conversation away from it almost immediately
sometimes i can control people absolutely seems hes decide when and who and who can noti mean i takes a sec to feel like them feeling their face as myyself
but now i am just staying at our house and sometimes the thought of hanging myself crosses my mind thinking which area of our house should i hang myself
i have been seriously depressed for a couple of years now i do not want to have to tell the whole story since then i have been trying to find my calling purpose meaning call it what you want without success
and he went off at me he started yelling that i needed to get my shit done and not waste my time with him
i able to socialize properly instead of usually i able to talk to girls including my crush properly instead of getting nervous inside
i was able to hold back my panic attack until i got home and then freaked out in on the bathroom floor again
eventually i put 2 and 2 together and realized that this feeling in my head is the culprit that causes everything i do to fail or be worse
not that i am entitled to one but i would have figured that after 7 years there would be some conversation i wanted to apologize for everything i wanted to understand the situation
my friends my family the people i have met online then the guilt of making those people upset set in and it hurts
two of her siblings who live like 4 hours away offered her a very nice place to live but she freaked out and started blubbering not wanting to be that far from her daughter
i think if i had a partner lined up i would be ok with leaving kind of like having a job offer before you quit
this topic is very important to me because this pandemic has also impacted me on an emotional level to be honest if it was not for the online twitch community i do not know what my life would look like as dark as that sounds
i just want to be normal again i know as a fact that if i was not born my family would be much happier
i am just at a loss at what to do because i want him in my life even as friends because we had a great connection and talked to eachother about things we never did with anyone else
3 i do not want to age and face health problems get wrinkles and etc i apologize for being cynical but i feel like being young is the only worthwhile part of living yes you can get married and have kids but that is not in my agenda
he also told me he was not doing it to be single but rather to be happy but now idk i know deep down it is a rebound relationship but i am struggling
we had met a few years back and she hung out with him and i when i think about that night i feel happy
my friends are all telling me to accept it is over and move on but i jusy do not feel ready for that yet
it has been like this every year sitting alone in my room hoping for someone to give a shit i think i will become dangerous if i keep disassociating like this which i really do not want it would be really cool if it was somewhat different this year but i am not hoping for anything i do not hope
he has some issues and i feel like instead of addressing those and working on himself he has pushed me away because it seems like the easy option
i deal with this a lot i have people around me but cannot escape the empty lonely feeling i have my wife and kids yet feel lonely and alone
i find myself looking at my dads 1911 which i carry everydaywondering why i do not stick the thing in my mouth and pull the trigger
i did not want them to look down on me even more in any case my ex gf wants nothing to do with me she does not want to see me
by the way 90 of the time i start the conversation and end it since they never respond back people who becomes a part of me and then slowly fades away to nothing i remember laughing with her
he was practically falling over himself drunk i was so upset with him i wish i did not know as much as i did it just does not seem worth it man
they expect so much from me like they want me to become this or that when i do not even know what i want to be i can not even picture my future without being dead that is why i have no goals in life
i am looking at creating a platform where people can meet new people for platonic relationships friendships i have compiled a survey to understand the issue a bit more and i was hoping if anyone had five minutes you could fill it out
hi i was wondering if anyone else is feeling lonely in nyc would like to know if anyone from here is from nyc and would like to be friends
i was diagnosed with asd as a toddler and was not told until i was eight years of age i always knew i stood out as a child as friends were hard to come by
i have not been shown any physical love or affection in years no interest intimacy no comfort i am pushed away like a bug
hello i have been thinking one thought for a very long time it was always at the tip of my tongue but i have never truly realised that i had had it
and this bothers me and many people who are suffering under mental health conditions like those i have met in my times being inpatient it even interferes with my therapy since i struggle to take myself serious anymore
i was more a less her first true relationship as her last ones did not last a month at most and they occurred during her years at secondary school days we got together in 2016 and she is in uni now
there is a jazz radio station where i live my bedroom radio and car radio are both set to that channel and i never touch the dial
emancipation is out of the question due to my lack of financial stability and i am unsure of where else to go
it meant so much to me this help and i realised i am desperate for a friend for someone to talk to feeling so alone and isolated
he was sweet and funny and sensitive and smart and had lots of great friends and family and he made such a big deal about how great i was and how attractive he thought i was
so this man was the first one who actually dedicated his time to be with me and know me he also enjoyed my company so i decided to take him home i mean i come from a different town from the one i meet him to meet my family and have good christmas and new year
i am pathetic mediocre at best and have no future to speak of it is so humiliating to write this but i do not know what else to do
off topic but i hope you all enjoy your christmas i just do not belong here i told her about all of it she said we would work in it
i told her to stop because it hurt and she said no she did not took her hands off until i stayed still
for those who stalk your ex on social media or just checking to see how they are doing what are your feelings like when you see how they are doing without you regret happy angry
i truly thought if i waited my old friend would appear on the other side of this long period of addiction and avoiding responsibilities
my biggest interest is anime but i think our town only has 1 convention in the spring just the thoight of going to one sends me into a panic
there for him during his naturalization couple months later we had moved in together no mom and my evidence for that however sparse is very strong
why is it that the horrible people get away with this why is it that i am here by myself in my apartment in bushwick and she is in love again with another guy
from eating right taking care of ourselves when you exercise and eat well you are showing yourself that you matter and you care
she was being distant months before our anniversary just feel horrible that the man i loved more than anything may be in fact dead inside now
i will float and slip through the fucked up mental health system this country has we talked for a little bit and you told me how much you are struggling
i guess in a way you can say i was trying to show her that there are goodhearted people out there in the world that would only want to give her the best and see her do her best which i really wished she could see
i can not even get proper diagnosis or anything because where i live mental illnesses are severely frowned upon and so is getting help for them
i feel like lately i have been feeling pretty good it is a big improvement but i just got that feeling a little while ago it is a feeling so strong that it can ruin my day just this sudden overwhelming feeling of loneliness and hopelessness
i am not going to go into why i am suicidal but just know i also have a degenerative disease that will significantly affect my lifespan and make me disabled at some random time i do not know
i either do not get phone calls at all or if i do it is because i owe money or have to show up to an appointment or something
finally and this week i thought to myself i am ready to meet someone else i am a chinese i love history and writing
i want to hurt myself i want to paint all my shoes and be a youtuber i want to be content i want to be loved for the right reasons i want to look so good it makes peoples eyes bleed i want to a cornish rex i want stronger anxiety medication i would like my clothes to fold themselves i want to imagine a future that is not lonely i want something
i know i should not care but i feel really bad about all this i just wish things had not been so messed up
my friends know that it is not good but they do not know that it is been getting much worse these past few months
basically for context i had some pretty shit teachers and parents who made fun of me and taught me to surprised my emotions and tolerate mistreatment
i feel there arnt any options i do not have the patience to play games for long enough to make friends and there is not much of a social scene here
these tumors have affected my hearing and the entire right side of my body i have had 4 tumor removals done so far in the span of 11 years
just a few days ago i went i went out to grab some water at the local grocery store just seeing people again going about their lives instantly made me feel better
the feeling was peaceful when i was unconscious i actually long for it at times but yeah sadly i am awake and i had to drop out of school
nope nothin from her no text no call i guess i did not know her like i thought thanks for the well wishes yesterday sucked but it is in the past right
which is what i did they are using my weakness of naivety they got me to attack the people i love because
why am i so attracted to her i did this to myself but i can not help but think of our first kiss
i just want to leave this earth i really do hope heaven is real so i can live in peace i can not see my future i just got a bunch of codeine pills and locked them away so if the day comes i know i have a way out
the three of us would hang out all the time and we all planned on moving in together but all that seems like a nightmare now
sorry that i am here i just need to tell what i am feeling right now sorry for my english it is far from perfect
i do not do anything but go to my shityy minimum wage job and do drugs everyday to feel numb and forget everything
i think that the world wants me to die sometimes i must be one of the most broken and discarded people on the face of the earth
it is so frustrating and it is been such an awful week but overall i am just frustrated i am alone again i know i have my daughter but i still do not feel close to her
the sun always comes up after that it all changed meanwhile he pushed for us to plan the wedding right away
i devote all my time and energy to get a laugh today is the first time anyone has ever told me they miss me
i grew up with manipulation and emotionless behavior i did not realize until i thought about my current dating life that i am the same way
my relationship has been awful for the last couple months been dating a little over a year now and i did everything in my power to fix things i went to therapy read self help books and tried listening to my partners needs
i got back together with him this time because he said that he would change and that he was sorry for how he treated me in the past i told him that he had given me trust issues etc but i wanted to give him another chance and then this happened
i struggle with jealous feelings a lot that i sometimes can not keep to myself and it is hurting my relationships with others does anyone have any advice on how to deal with these feelings in a way that does not put others in compromising positions or make something a negative situation
i feel like i should be sad still or should care more i think i stopped being sad a long time ago too close to when she passed away
if anyones gone through a similair time how did you get through it not looking for pity just some advice i will be okay thank you
now that it is really setting in i can see how much trauma he really inflicted onto me i can not help but to still love him but i know it will take time
my wife and best friend and soulmate told me today that she is not in love with me anymore i am devastated and alone looking for support thank you
that i should not feel love anymore and expose myself to being hurt again but i know that is fucked up irrational thinking and deep down i know i can not do that
i do not have any friends in real life i just get a few messages a yearly from old school friends and i have a pretty close friend but who i have never met in real life we only talk to each other on the internet because we do not live in the same country
i never wanted to be with anyone else just him i have no one and i miss himi am the only one probably who still did not receive any notification on home page about the facebook dating
people do not just get why i am hurting all the time have to explain i was raped and i can hear it every night i am tired
so for some context we were together 4 years he wanted a break and he told me it was because we argued a lot which we did but it was only because every little issue that we had he never wanted to address or work on he would instead ignore me for a long time
well fucking think again because i have been dealing with this since i was 21 and have seen multiple doctors about it and nothing can help me besides drugs that make me red give me headaches and make me congested to the point of not breathing
i told him i hated him and blocked him i texted him on another account apologizing and asking for a real goodbye but he ignored me
i just want to be happy with someone else just like you are i want to build a future with someone that i will not compare to you anymore
i try to eat well and sit in the sun listen to music and tend to some houseplants everything to not fall into another deep depression
i was talking to him while he was about to attempt it was honestly one of the most terrifying things i have experienced
your confidence is what has been hurt and torn down after a break up because our confidence became as strong as that relationship was
you took it all with you i let you into every corner of my life and now there is nowhere to turn without seeing your face
after 5 weeks i still think about her i think i actually are going to lose my mind i been trying to do stuff and keep myself busy but it just will not work i started wake up at night and can not sleep well i can just remember all the memories of her and all the trips we where going on
and in the moment i legit feel like i am at the bottom of the barrel like everything with this boy is over and i have no way to fix things that never needed fixing
the first year moved pretty quickly as i had never ever had someone be so sweet to me without any games
and i know i should not be doing this i just feel like an attention seeker and it is horrible but i do not know what else to do or how to deal with this literally all i want and need is someone in my life and i have no idea how to do that either all i do is wait and believe it will happen naturally but who knows
but no friends have ever really planned anything for my birthday like ever i can not really explain itthose are details that i feel like i would list if i had a therapist
i mailed her a birthday present that i had already gotten and that was that i can not think of a single person who i am in their social circle not even one
when she told me that i was so happy because i finally knew what was wrong with me the thing is that even if i want to go to a therapist i can not in my country the hole health system is a wreak if you do not have covid you do not matter and it really worries me because i start college in january what should i do
i have adhd dyspraxia and a load of other sensory issues i have been self harming for 3 years now with 2 attempts and all that is happening is i am getting worsei try so hard to get my stupid lil think lump to produce dopamine but it does not
while if i stay in the province it is indeed a more comfortable life because we have a cook so i do not have to worry about preparing my own meals and i do not have to spend as much since everything here is generally cheaper but i do not have any friends here
i am nearing 26 which will mean i will lose any insurance i have i am physically disabled as well which is what started me down this spiral tonight
so i broke up with my girlfriend of a year just over 6 weeks ago let us call her kate not degrading myself or anything it is just how it is i feel like i am lacking sense of humor
i am really sorry if none of this makes any sense i am just confused and seeking answers thank youfuck this world see you on the other side
me and my ex had a beautiful relationship on many aspects we were best friends we never once had a serious fight in 9 years however we had a big big problem with sex
i did not want to leave but i know that staying would worsen the thoughts and i did not want to make him feel bad after he said he was happy
i just feel lonely all the time and my anxiety attacks are getting worse to the point where i cry for hours i do not even know why i am saying this here you guys can not help me this is my problem
i have tried taking my own life 3 times hanging twice and cutting once but i was too scared of the pain
i need to do my laundry did i pay my billsi am depressed but who do i tell that in a world where everyone has something
1 call for an emotional support chat we can talk about your day feel free to rant or talk about anything you want to
i really just do not want to live in this world anymore i just want to find a big piece of land to homestead so i never have to be apart of this evil place anymore god is acting like he will not help me so it is either i find a way to live like this very soon or else i am not going to be here anymore but why the fuck should anyone care
there was one very particular night where we went out for ice cream and we ended up talking about the deepest and most indepth conversations individuals could have together where we shared deep thoughts feelings and moments that define us and shaped our visions
i find myself not sleeping for days exercising excessively and always doing somthing all the while feeling like i am full of volatile evergy and could just about explode
when i ask them they talk about crushes about mutual feelings about butterflies in their chest but i do not know what that feels like
you will be contributing immensely to an important field of research that needs more attention urgently been receiving some dms from strangers promoting the serendip app
i wish issues like this were talked about more so i guess here i am i just want to be happy man
i just finished reading a book literally about cherishing life in the face of imminent mortality my birthday just passed this month and i received a lovely surprise from best friends
i do not have any friends who actually care enough about me to wish me a merry christmas at leasti went over again and we ended up kissing
2 friends have very busy work lives i do too4 trying to find some gf similar in religion similar in thoughts
but i have nobody to live for anymore my precious kitty was killed by my own crackhead niece while she robbed me apartment to hock everything for drugs while i laid fighting covid for 47 days
i really struggled to understand what may have caused my depression maybe it is been in front of me this entire time the big loneliness word a lot of people say they are lonely but everyone has different extents some people seem to be surrounded by peoplecolleges friends and yet they still preach their loneliness here is a little bit to understand my circumstances
but i do not know where i would go or what to do when i meet them i feel trapped and alone and i just want a way out
none of this was worth your wellbeing and it was selfish for me to want to be with you so bad
i hope you all have a wonderful merry christmas from my family to yours 3 i have a history of depression but nothing too major
you were the first girl who ever made me feel loved and sexy and visible you were my first love and i won i won the prize
she asked me to befriend her but i could not be friends with her cuz i have always loved her in a special way and i do not cling around her
my weight used to be something like 52 at my lowest and if i filled myself up with water ate a lot had to go the toilet and so on i peaked at close to 75 kilo
i have the mind set of one and i refused to file a statement or report my own injuries she always gets mad at me for leaving calls
her main reasons were that she was more in love with me than was i was with her and she was tired of waiting for me to break down my walls
and that is the other thing that bothers me about what i have read when i look at stuff about going nocontact it seems geared towards making the ex miss you
note in my experience i say drugs are bad which is why i used them in my examples people will think differently but if you have seen a person without them ie buddhist monks you would consider otherwise
hey guys so i dated this guy back in september we were really good friends for a year before we confessed our feelings to each other
however i soon realized the void that i was feeling was of the comfort and familiarity not just of people building new meaningful relationships takes time no one can expedite that process yet the question remains what does an individual do in the meanwhile the feeling of loneliness does not become any less real i still do experience it everyday even with people around
i am planning on consulting my grandma first because my mom is also unstable before messaging my mom about all the struggles i have been experiencing and about seeking professional help idk how i will respond to her questions about it because i can not speak about it without becoming too emotional and now i am thinking of just watching cats and dogs videos but omgwuqhqhagshwhahshugzvwuwhsvw i just want to get this over with and not bury myself alive
i am an abusive brother who blames his undiagnosed autism and is clueless about others feelingsi feel very alone with strong suicidal feelings and it is so painful
dear lonelinesshttpswwwdearlonelinesscom is a crowdsourced art exhibit research study and archival effort that is inviting as many individuals as possible to write about their experiences with isolation my friends and i started it to memorialize this year of strife and isolation while also connecting lonely people through artwith your permission these letters will be archived as both a record of the covid19 era and a crucial source of academic data
one day she just wrote me a big text saying how it was hard to tell me but she was just not feeling the same
i freaked out a lot and called her and got her today calm down and she was ok for a few days
i am autistic and deal with a bunch of mental health issues on top of always being rejected by women she told me she had faith in me and loved and cared for me
i have been on dating apps for awhile and have not had much luck any girls that i have met in person have shown no interest in me
i feel like a burden because i can not let my family take care of me forever well i wait for her to take me back
idk if i am ready to hear her voice he told me he was not ever going to get sick of me i did not prompt him to say this
lately i have been fantasizing about being burned alive and i know it is the probably the single most painful and unreliable way to end it but its so easy to do it is really scary to me that i regularly think about it
nobody understands me or if they do they do not care enough to do anything about it too busy with their own shit
next step is to stop religiously checking her social media and to stop thinking about her ordering food replacing wining and dining which we loved was getting stale
i tried reasoning with here exploring scenarios but it seemed more like a case of me wanting to make things work and her accepting that things would not work out barring only a specific scenario which again was subject to changing situations
i was devastated physically and mentally words may not even be enough to describe it the worst part is i love her like anything and she says she does not feel the same way anymore
she was becoming more distant and did not see me at all then she told me that she wanted to break up with me
so all of the semester i almost missed all of the classes i did not do homework i ended up forgetting about it or procrastinating
and that is the first step to simply observe the mind i have been stuck in a rut for years i have nothing left going for me
i wanted him to invest in it too and my handwriting is to die for so there is no need to order a book about hieroglyphs
this has been a thought that has been in my mind for a while and i thought i might as well tell the internet
some days i just wish i no longer existed in this world i feel so lonely makes me wonder if he was seeing her the whole time i was in georgia
every night i lay in my bed alone most days i would not even care but in the last weeks it are not leaving me alone
i think they might live in the town she and i lived in she had previously said to me multiple times that she wanted to leave that town and go somewhere new
i have tried making friends and sure i have friends on instagram people i have seen a few times but since then have only had a text based friendship with
i saved a around 875 and bought her what i thought at the time was a nice ring i was a kid back then and did not know anything
my mother gave me death threats if i did not clean my room or put my phone down she threatened to kill herself and selfharmed in front of me
i mean how low can a person really feel being replaced for internet friends and that alone i get it on the internet you can meet a like mined person but really enough that you forget someone that has been with you since highschool i have internet friends but i would not trade my real life friend in for themdespite he did that to me just now
i had a few friends but experienced that most of the people in my school perceived me as weird so i was not the type to go make new friends whenever i had the chance
this pandemic only made things worse and even with working from home and school and what not it still left me alone with my thoughts and has not done wonders for me
i wrote her an email apologizing and i have it set to get sent in a months time so that she does not ignore it in all her pissed off blunder
i feel like i could have done anything to make a difference and i do not i go to work i go home and i sleep
it is cold i did not want to stay up this late and all i can do is cry i am fed up with everything nothing feels right
i know it but i can not play now because of examsnot trying to sound full of myself just finally feelin myself again
i was confused because my mother is a super religious 65 year old woman who would not even sit in a closed room with another man or shake hands let alone have an affair
i am 24 and i have been struggling with pnes psychological non epileptic dissociative conversion seizures for 11 years i do not have epilepsy or any other neurological disease and most likely also no underlying cptsd
the dangerous part comes whenwell let us just say that it is easier to harm others when you are prone to harming yourself maybe that was their true goal from the start to get you to the point that you hate yourselftoo bad no one will ever call them out for doing thisi will
most likely i will go before the new year it is really calming to know that i am thankful for you guys you helped me through a lot of rough times thank you
i feel stupid and worthless and forgettablemy 16 father 47m was in a car accident almost 25 years ago summer 2018
when you just want to stop feeling all of the up and down up and down feelings when you just want to for once in your life be on could nine
if i stay here too much i might actually freaking kill my self ik she is over me she said so
i realized something is up later he gave me his phone so i could find a picture for him and i find pictures of my moms call logs specifically pictures of incoming calls with this neighbor
and have a really big problem with not being able to tell if someone likes me does not like me and is just being polite and any of the other stuff in between so i just assume everyone hates me unless they really go out of their way in which case i still fuck it up by being awkward being a bad conversationalist and being in bad moods all the time
i know i am better off i know i did not deserve what happened to me so why am i the one left feeling so awful why do i still love him and miss him while he gets off scott free and happy how in the hell could he do that and just be okay
prioritizing my mental health meant burning some of the last bridges i had left and now i am just floating by myself
i am tired of seeing them get exhausted and drained because of me and my baggage they do not deserve to live like this
i leave really nasty comments on posts and videos featuring these kinds of men all of this is not cheap either which makes me think i am a burden
i am not able to help myself so i am searching for someone who can do it it is very sad and i hope i could change it but i do not know how to do it
i know it is a pandemic and i have used many months to try to process the breakup and pain but i have really really bad days and i do not know how to get a positive perspective after all this
i just could not believe what was happening i loved this person i thought they loved me i thought we had something unbreakable
i do not want to forget about you ben so why are you making me forgetting about you your face your voice your hugs your smilethat hurts the most i am being forced to forget you
if you look at my profile there is another post of mine that i wrote a while ago explaining a bit of the situation i am in right now
she really tried to love me but she was also toxic in her resolve to keep me from others and would hack into my social media to keep tabs on me
deep down i know that she was not the right girl for me and that our relationship continued to steadily get worse and worse after our first year of dating but i am still longing for that girl that i first met and fell madly in love with
sry for my english but i am from germanyafter some time apart we both broke nocontact on a few occasions because we really missed eachother
we have been separated for around 6 months we lived together before that we never argued there were never any problems between us
but there were no good vibes this time all the thoughts that i usually push down into my mind were coming to the surface how i only have 3 friends who i rarely see how i spend most of my days by myself how i have no girlfriend how i have no way to meet anyone and the worst part is these facts were true even before the pandemic
ultimately self love even influences much of your needy tendencies the more selflove you possess the less needy you will be and vice versa
and now she stopped feeling it with me for a not totally clear reason to me consequently i am going to stop as well
i want to go into software development but there is too much you need to be able to do just to get an entry level job
since my death there has been so much progress but being a woman is this battlefield means less blood more tears
one week ago my girlfriendex girlfriend kind of ghosted me no replies and did not even read the messages until i asked what is wrong
my ex was very inconsistent with her jobs during our relationship as a result i primarily supported us financially in a job that was the furthest occupation from fulfilling
i can not remember the last time i felt this alone i had a wonderful girl and everything felt mildly okay but she left me because my anxiety was getting the better of me and getting in the way of bettering myself
i think i love someone i have not met and its breaking me apart so i am not sure how healthy this is i think it is ok
this study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088absolute cold or is it untapped rage or sadness
sometimes i think it would have been better if i just killt myself 6 years ago with all the mobbing having no friends and just living bc i have to
still can not wait for the day when i am allowed to cut my wrists open and fucking end it already yeah i am a fucking attention who are and you can probably call me one rn too
this was one of the lowest points i have ever had and i told no one i considered checking myself into a mental hospital as i needed a break from taking care of myself
i take melatonin to help me sleep and it does help some although i do not feel i should have to rely on it to just sleep every night
stuck wondering if i convinced myself it was as unbalanced as it was when it was not the general idea that i am a bad person or a psychopath very much associated with the second theme
my pneumonia caused it so i could not no longer eat food orally and the food would go down the wrong pipe
and it broke me hopefully there will be a time when i look forward to it again instead of dread it
i spend months asking myself what i did so wrong he could never ever love me and treat me like shit
i am getting depressed again i take 150 mg xl this was supposed to help with depression and adhd but it is not doing much now
i was meant to go back to college i was meant to marry my fiancéit is been a year since the day she told me she no longer loved me
so long story short i just ended a relationship of over a year with my bf 27 but we knew each other for five years prior to being in a committed relationship
also messaging someone over the internet just is not the same as talking to them in person if anything my weekend job has become my only chance to socialise with others
after this i rarely heard from her for the past few months she called me every few weeks for 20 minutes
she told me in some other parallel universe she might have felt different but in this universe she did not feel the same and as moving as the letter was she did not feel the same so in a way she said it made her feel uncomfortable
2months ago my gf breakup with mei asked her reason for breakupshe replied that she wants to be alone and do not want relationship with me or with anyone anymorenow what should i dorespect her decision as i always do or keep on asking her solid reason to move on
sometimes you can not even be fully present when you are with people you have loved you watch your activities fold out like scenes in a movie
i do not want to be a slave i feel like a slave when i work if i feel trapped in a slave job late in my life i might kill myself
the one that is not i went to in march and i hated the staff and the np did not recognize my very obvious mania
we had one last date together that i thought went well but after i texted her and asked her what was up she said she was too busy for school
i have got no reason to talk to her every day i am usually busy with myself she is been helping me a lot recently i have been able to overcome some of the worst of it
my family is called paranoid because we are so cautious i have not seen any of my friends since he lockdowni am kind of looking for some good news some hope
i am diagnosed with a few serious mental illnesses bipolar schizoaffective disorder which for years was full blown schizophrenia but that is what my current psychiatrist is calling it dissociative derealization disorder and ptsd among a few other ones
i am not a bot but the following is a secret base64 message loli am 22 years old man with zero handy man skills i can not do the following things properly
not allowing me to like any girls pics on instagram but she was free to like anything she wants and i would just not bat an eye to those things because i was just trying my best to be accommodating to her needs
there are some moments where i just think to myself about how much i just want to connect with someone i have not deeply connected with someone in years and i feel so disconnected and distant from everyone i know i want to have a happy and positive lifestyle and i want to just not think sad and depressing thoughts constantly but i fail everytime
we have put some good boundaries in place but here is the problem i feel like my transference is more severe than what we have touched on during sessions
we have worked hard these last years to fix this place up and call it our own after she abandoned it and said she did not want it
i have battled with the sentiment that everyone has their own difficulties and i respect that however it feels unhealthy to constantly avoid the fact that i feel lonely even amongst lonely people
to study then had a mental breakdown and was really painful barely passed all courses at that time like what that made me really confused he was being really rude to me so i ended it
after 3 months he started seeing his highschool friend that he used to talk flirty to her 10 years ago and i advised my bf to stay away from her and block her so she lives in toronto and my bf goes to her for some advise to fix our relationship or at least this is what he told me but ended up she got attached and socking his d on halloweens night
i forget things far more frequently than i should and do not remember most of my life this memory loss is being noted by people close to me very frequently
they told me stay off till she calls me i created this short film to kind of explain the feelings i am going through i hope i am not alone
the colleague i was with also never wished me i asked him whether he would like to eat a cake along with me and said he does not eat cakes i just ended up ordering myself a cupcake and eating it all alone
so i know that this might be seen as a luxury problem because some people do not have any friends and therefore really struggle but still if you have some insight please let me know thanks
he cheated but he came to me crying the next morning he cheated but he is the one posting happy things on social media i am scared he is telling everyone that i cheated or that i was the mistake
i have been reading up different ways to od on over the counter pills i do not understand why it did not work no one seems to care at all
we have a shared album and i seriously do not want him to have any photos of me if it is going down this road
is what i would say if i was stupid and did not have any selfrespect they pop into my head at random times typically unsolicited memories dreams flashes
i will not be able to think anymore the thought of it was scary but not anymore everything in life is given to me i should be so thankful and so happy
i just broke up with my ex who i had been friends with for a year prior to dating i met her in my grad school cohort and it started really rocky
not feeling well feeling worthless just want her to get out of my mind we were going to spend the rest of our lives together
he then goes on to say he never fell out of love with me and that he hates it when he finds out that i am speaking to other guys but he knows he can not do anything about it to this i said you are choosing not to and he did not reply to that but kept saying that he did this because of stress
but i do not know how to fucking solve it or how to get the kind of help with the kind of quality and authenticity that i need
i just can not stop having contact to him i wish i could just throw him out of my life like i always did when someone broke my heart but this time it is different i keep on hanging onto him and i know it is toxic just can not stop my feelings
friends with benefits as it is she told me they hooked up when they made a plan to hang out to practice bondage
i am giving it time because i do hope things will improve but i do not think they will i think i will use again and then i will end it
i am extremely embarrassed and guilty because i disappointed my parents 2 years i got expelled from my previous school for that reason
i also feel strong voltagelike in the back of my brain it feels so physical i do not really know will i get to know what is the root of me basically
this is pretty much a vent session but i just want to know if there are others like me sometimes i wake up already in a panic attack and have to do square breathing exercises to calm myself down
i hate that i let this person have so much power that i rewarded his behavior towards me and nothingness
so i broke no contact and texted him merry christmas and he did not reply and now this is even worse than the break up
has a lot of girl friend that shows interest in me but i do not find them appealing enough to take risk and court them to be my girl i just do not know what is happening with my life i am happy with all the happenings in my life but then i feel like i do not have someone to share this with and understands what i am really feeling right now
i do not want to let someone kill me or let myself do that but i feel like if i never existed things would be better
i regret asking her out so much what if we never be friends like that again right now i just want to talk to her
she is intelligent and autistic enough to understand me more than most of the population she feels more like a human of my specie than most
i was fine but during this attack it turned out i also sliced myself open and did not notice till the next day
and he had the audacity to tell me that i did not support him enough and that i was the reason he was not making enough money
i never said anything bad to her we had arguments which we used to solve eventually i do not want to die but i just do not want to live anymore
we really enjoyed each others company every time we were hanging out there was something about her that really stuck out and i had a really good feeling about things
i broke up with my ex fiance of a year and a half about a month ago i pry should have broke up in person i know
the night where things looked bleak between us when she was here in the city she told me she had cried because i had taken the blame on me for not being able to work it out between us
instead of being cool respecting her and being patient i tried to push her to meet as was planned she told me that i was pressuring her and that she will not take that
it is so important for us to be mindful and conscious of the language we allow because the more we say we are broken i feel broken this broke me you are now programming your mind to believe that you need to be fixed or replaced
i had a girl in my class back in the 8th grade i loved her and when i admitted my feelings she said that finals were approaching and i should concentrate on them and she even said that she would think about this in the next grade
my brain and body fight me so much i get tired i am 25 about to be 26 it is not like i do not have the support system because i do i just can not talk about it
so here i am now 31 jobless i am doing some state exams to try to get inside a public administration but i am failing every time friendless loveless depressed of course lonely
i lived in a run down apartment on what is known as the bunker worst part of the town your happiness and well being is so important
and sometimes it is really annoying and could make me feel isolated and lonely i also feel like punching the person wearing the airpods especially if he has an arrogant face
then i realized that my suggestions were only making it worse so i just said that in the future when he does not want me to give suggestions to just say beforehand that he just wants to vent and he agreed to that
i isolated and did my best to improve upon myself and move on it did not work and i always thought of her
obviously i would have left long ago if it did not seem all rainbows and butterflies at first or at least had some sort of explanation
she is going to move in with me on the weekendi already bought her favorite snacks and food but i feel like i could do more
the following year while everyone else got a normal christmas bear with the year and their name written on the feet what i received would be referred to as a suicide bear
i tried to tell him i am fine and i need a good break alone with him but he would not have it he yelled and yelled and everytime i would speak up he would shut me up and tell me this is for my own good and that i need to hear this
compared to the first time it seems rather similar only that time she let other guys treat her to whatever she wanted
i think i will just say the truth i do not think i can dive into a serious ldr relationship for such a long time
anytime i remind myself of one of these things of someone is death i feel like none of it is actually true
i do not have to think what did i do wrong because i do not want to i did not do anything wrong by asking you to spend the rest of your life with me it is your incompetency to match the intensity of love it is your cowardice that you failed to love me back
i occasionally get upset and have a cry about it because he really was such an amazing guy but unfortunately my mental health issues sabotaged the relationship
i feel like i have not had any time to do stuff i want to do but whenever i do get time i waste it by procrastinating
there is so much fucking stress and i can not take it anymore i want to die right now please someone just come and fucking kill me
i have tried to change my mindset and think of it as solitude and not isolation or lonliness i guess i will give context
they say the reason they were able to live their lives after coming to america without getting depressed was because or their parents
the only thing keeping me on this earth are those that care about me but i could never tell them the things i feel i do not want them to know
i stood there and until i regained some of my strength back the guilt started to consume me too much to finish my plan
everyone else around him does not seem to care about his well being they all think it is funny because it does not affect them
there is a dark line between the lips in the outline of several waves in a turbulent storm it says do not kiss me do not fool me i am a dancer who cannot dance
she came to visit for a week the next year travelled half way around the world to see me and that week i dumped her like a stone i really have awful memories of watching her in the train going to the airport with my cold heart happy to see her gone
i thought she just had trouble processing what i did but the truth was there was something more dark going on that she was too cowardly to tell me
i can not be fun where you choose to see me i can be fun in other places but it is those places where you do not want to see me
i really love when i am alone doing things that is interest me i live in a country that does not allow anything for me i do not get out that is unacceptable and if i do it is only once in a month or so there is school ofcourse then home
everyone where i live is a religious fucking nut and i just hate it it seems like i would only be prolonging my suffering
one year ago i was spending winter break texting a girl at school nonstop talking to her was like crack i just could not get enough of it
when i am alone with my thought it just really hurts the only thing i can do is scream in my head but that never helps nothing ever helps
i just want to cry and hug my partner i am really scared and i need to help him but i do not know how
i do have plans and ambitions now i do have some friends though none of them are close enough i have some occasional lovers interacting with whom seems to be my way of selfharm my life is quite bearable though so many of my plans went downhill because of the pandemic and recently i have been going through a series of unfortunate events which impacted my mental state
she did not even want to talk about the problems we would been having so i went with it not to hurt her further
i have been getting therapy since and really working on myselfacknowledging what i did wrong in the relationship he has gone the other way and has been drinking and god knows what else
i do not have anyone i trust that i could tell them everything no family some friends but rather be alone especially holidaz and birthdays
grown ass man threw a hissy fit because i did not make his eggs the right way or another time i did not order him mcdonalds while i was on vacation
i do not abuse i am not a junki or whateveri know it is not the right solution drungs does not help me but you know what fuck it idc anymore
i showed up and the birthday boy wanted me to drink with him i ended up drinking more than i was expecting so i could not drive home
it is been a month and it still hurts every day i am craving that connection we had irl hookups and casual relationships do not heal the pain i tried them and hated them time with friends is a short distraction i am alone most of the time because of my parents keeping me home for the last two weeks of the semester all i do is miss him all my favorite songs remind me of him
i am pretty sure he is going to get hiv keeps fucking people and does not cure his infectioni am not sure how to feel
there is way more to blame myself for i could have been a way better partner no doubts but my insecurities and mental illnesses made me struggle to be so
let me explain as far as i know anyone in my country how is mentally ill is known as a crazy person
i am 28m and quite frankly i have maybe 2 friends 1 lives at the other side of the country and the other is my housemate who i have only known for about 2 years and frankly he is probably my closestbest friend but i know that only comes from us living together
but even till now i am unsure if i am just being dramatic and that it was just recreational use gone wrong or if i knew in the back of my mind that it was an attempt and that is why i did it
if there is school it is just the same except i wake up at 7am and go to online class and do the same things after school there is no fun and mental stimulation are your days just like mine it is super sad
proud of myself i know that sounds really messed up but strangling myself somehow made me calm down but the amount of sanitizer i drank was not enough to kill me
but i am so scared of telling my work and each day i do not i dig a deeper and deeper hole i do not like people being mad or disappointed in me i had a damn strong panic attack while driving back from picking it up
on her profile she is posting about going out and enjoying her life which is great however she is being very flirty and said to me she would flaunt what she has
then my tooth was causing me problems i had to remove it and pay huge money for it like almost my whole salary type of money
i got extremely attached with him as he did with me no more energy to have to keep doing this no family or partner
it is not a question but just i wanted to write it out of my head the only problem is we were long distance i started getting clingy and attached and he started drifting away
i know you love me i love you i am sorry my love is not enough to make up for it all or to take us back in time to when things were simple and you still believed in yourself and a future maybe you will again one day maybe i can work hard enough so that nothing else matters but i do not know if i can
i am not sure if he is not sure about his feelings right now so he wants to keep in contact or he just does not want to hurt me
i know that my life is not over yet but i feel so helpless at this point i have been coping ok but today it hit very hard
i am always paranoid that the only proper friends i have had the ones on discord all hate me even though they tell me time and again they do not
realizing that you are in denial is a huge leap towards acceptance so good job so far later he told me he did not tell me because he felt ashamed
not sure really what to do since i always bail when i am actually about to attempt it it is another fucking lonely friday i am on my way to 29th noparty new years eve
they are supportive and have not changed but i have now that they know i just feel like less of a person to them
i was in a relationship 2 years back i am so stuck and tired i do not think i am going to make it
it was the same guy she was playing with months ago and they liked each other photoslately my loneliness has been through the roof
something in me snapped and i felt all of a sudden that i was just being used while she plotted future plans until she was ready to leave she never had any intention to work on our relationship she picked a suitcase and left very quickly never to return
so my ex and i broke up recently we share a rental but when we split we decided i would keep the rental and he would move out
she made a drunk monologue but the meaning was she did not want anything more than a friendship and she still hated me for some things
i am no online marketer but if you find this info cool and have like 30 minutes and want to read the whole thing you can do it here httpsmaxjancarcomhowtomoveonfromyourexhttpsmaxjancarcomhowtomoveonfromyourex
i just can not do it and i wanted to put something out there before i off myself because i have hit my breaking point 5 years ago and been fighting the demons in my head even longer that tell me to just end the pain and misery
made me realise that my family do miss these things and if i kept that in mind maybe getting help would seem more worthwhile
no one asks how i am doing and no one cares i am more than my looks but i am still a loser
i asked her if she is still happy with our relationship she said she does not know what to say and that she was thinking of ending the relationship
i am still incredibly lonely but i just do not want to know anymore i do not want life to continue waving how it does not desire me in my face anymore
eventually he said he was making food so he again went upstairs honestly it is just so nice to see other human beings at the weekend particularly ones around my age
by the end of march b of of m my suffering ended or so thought i i can not take it anymore waking up and realizing that my life is not what i want it to be
is loneliness making anyone else feel joyless and defeated i feel so empty and i am struggling to enjoy doing anything if i can not do it with someone
there are people that are not alone surrounded by people family and friends but they still have this feeling of loneliness
i am starting to move on i found someone else i have no feelings for you anymore then why the hell do i keep remembering and thinking of random things just leave me alone please quit haunting me i really like this girl i do not want to just keep randomly thinking about you leave me alone
i also do not know how long this will be and i will not ask for a timeline of course but that is been on my mind ever since she said it
you do not necessarily feel better knowing other people have the same struggles i had to walk away eventually i am so confused
all my peer groups are showy and like to rub it in my face they brag about their new cars and how they were able to mod it to 700 hp
and then it all comes down crashing where i isolate myself again i came to realise that this is the side effect of being alone for so long that even when you get people you will not get out of the loneliness
i know i should not dwell on the past but those were the happiest days of my life if i look at the future it is just a continuation of these most miserable days
i wake up go on youtube spend the entire day watching pointless videos then go back to sleep i am on antidepressants they are not working
then it was summer and i had exams so i recluded myself to study until mid july when i had the last exam
i do not want to date because i am scared of opening myself up to someone again and having them betray and hurt me the way he did
i feel bad about this and shallow but i do not know how to change it mind you i suppose it does not matter much either way given the above
i understand the selfish nature of this and know first hand the destruction such an act will bring upon the people who care for me but i truly believe that ending things now will minimize the damage i could because them in the long run or maybe that is just an excuse for my selfishness i am tired of living and going through the motions with no hope in a world i just can not adapt too i am not sure why i am writing this but it feels cathartic to share these thoughts i kept to myself for so long
anyone got tips i thought at least talking about it might help me outabout a month ago i went out with a girl extremely important to me
note she was my old boss for 25 years and i am nervous on what kind of recommendations she will give me now
the reason why i am unsure about it is because at the time i told myself that i am going to take some pills and drink a bunch of alcohol just for the sake of having fun and cheering myself up
hopefully there will be a time when i look forward to it again instead of dread it later that night i was playing a game with friends when it finally hit me
it is honestly difficult for me to do it i genuinely do not have the motivation to do it i drink probably at max an 8oz cup a day when i am feeling very parched but other than that that is really it i just need motivational reasons why to do it to get my mentality going please thank you
i drank 2 vodka drinks on christmas eve and maybe i should not have done that while taking wellbutrin but i still feel bad
the problem with the urge and thoughts is now worse i am really fixated on mutilation and i want so badly to see what is under my skin
i have barely been this happy before not only did she tell me she misses me but also implied that she thinks i am funny
then all of a sudden she deleted all of her social media left nothing never told me anything i tried asking her dad and he told me that it was because a therapist recommended that and that she would call me soon
i know it is time to let him move on but he started seeing this girl within a week and when i asked about it he says she is just a friend
then last nov our other cat died ending that long connection after my gf passed i had met a woman from another country
i really hope you find some sort of happiness in your life and i hope you get that animal rescue job you talked about
could someone try to explain what could be happening if i should try to text her more or if i am becoming crazy by searching for her in news
how awful is it you still play me like a chess piece and even worse is that i would gladly be your pawn
and now i am struggling to stay his friend while also being in love with him i want to still be there for him
i would not normally post this but these thoughts have kind of become intrusive and i do not know how to deal with them i can not sleep at night anymore because of it anyone have any advice for me
so if you have not found your hobby or what you want to do just try different things this might sound corny but it does not hurt to try
i started having trouble talking to new people in my teens but in high school i already had friends from my childhood
my brain has been so hard to keep quiet this pass week ideas keep racing in my head on how i could simply end my life and no one would care so many ideas and i can not shut them up
on the surface ppl think i am cuz i am surrounded by religious ppl a part of their help includes doing prayers and speaking to god and so on
i think that is the scariest part after my senses kick in moments later i actually picture myself doing the things that pop into my head with such ambiguity or ambivalence that for a split second i imagine that it is the very next thing i am going to do
but when there is not enough interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it we go into more depth on the it gets better issue in this psa posthttpswww
the day before she started acting weird she was on the phone with this guy so i just responded with yes
but i do not get it why is life so sad if only i could swap with that child or other people who is in the same situation or something similar
it was randomly recommended to me and tbh i felt personally attacked as someone who is 21 and literally has no friends i was intrigued
i started seeing a psychiatrist earlier this year after 10 years of suffering with anxiety and depression it was a tough journey and i really did not think i would get better
since that day i always saw lisa and him together but he and all hismy friends kept telling me that they were just friends i knew they were practically living together but i always believed the people around me
then he decided to pursue mba in an ivy league university and my father was very supportive because of what happened it is not possible for my brother to go abroad anymore
last year my mum remarried and has a new life and home with her husband i do not have a particular plan per say
thoughts i heard someone say that your most apprehended and safe memories are the ones that you do not recalli actually stopped crying about it now i just feel empty and calm about it its weird
i am not expecting a response i am not mad and i am not angry at you please note that i never judged or blamed him for it
i have loved and been loved so i would like to believe i find i could still have the life i did but even then it was not making me happy
him aside from my existence well basically i am awake now from all of it and i am slowly reaching out to certain people to see if things actually happened how i remember them do you remember the stage one of the teachers
i still love my ex but any possibility of us ever getting back together is not going to happen i guess i am just here looking for opinions on redownloading dating apps after a breakup
every day i keep getting bigger and bigger waves of loneliness my group of friends keeps getting smaller and smaller i feel like i never learned how to make friends and now i have been living in a new city for 3 years and i still have not built a strong network of friends like i thought i would
people here tell me to go to every party i can even though i really do not want to i have been socially retarded all my life everyone around me thinks i am retarded
one of my friends rejected me yeah it was a few months ago but i still feel like killing myself over it because it makes me feel like i am ugly
find out she was with another guy a guy she was unloyal to me with before i forgave her and here it comes she post on her priv story my future boyfriend and it broke my heart
i do not expect any method to be totally painless but i would like to figure out some of the least painful ways to do it
i also started experiencing some form of panic attacks my own diagnosis like i said i have never talked to a professional to be diagnosed with anything
i am floored by this mainky i do not feel i deserve it but i know refusal will only get my dad involved so i accept
was getting other peoples faces was fine till it was news reporters facesagain pissing me off a fucking lot this news reporter has a book on faces what is the name for what this calledit had to me the point were was eating fucking medication i do not need
but it is hard to live with those realizations and it is hard to live knowing she does not want me anymore i just want this dream to be over
i have already made a plan for my suicide i will make sure that everything is taken care of before i leave this world
and as i write this i am sat alone in my room crying for no reason everyone says we are made for each other but i must have driven him away with my issues
that just hurts a loti have thought this on and off for years and have been very open with him about my concerns
i am fine that i never wanted any of that but this made me clear how much he loves my brother compared to me
he said human were designed for this type of isolation it only going to get worse has more shopping moves online
nobody to celebrate my birthday with nobody to celebrate anything with i have accepted it i am done fighting those feelings of denial
she has problems grasping that i am not what she wanted me to be and even if she says she does get it is more of a
but now i am scared she will contact my mum again and i can not take back the aemaol she probably will not get it
now i am kind of thinking it is not an age immaturity thing and it is just covert narcissism i have been hearing that he had been making out with girls and that he is fine
unironically if someone were to kill me i would almost consider it a favour at this point least there would be closure for those close to me other then he could not tolerate life anymore that was the fate of my uncle and first cousin and my family are still recovering from the fall out from that why did not he say anything years on
i know this all sounds crazy and although we really needed to breakup it still hurts thinking about him being with someone else after just a few months of being apart
honestly though i think i deserve to feel like shit because of what i did last week she told me she was not as depressed anymore i just feel so confused
after that this behavior has gotten worse and worse and now it is slipping into everyday life can anyone at least tell me what is going on
i worked my butt off of trying to make her feel like a princess made sure i did everything to make her happy and i did just so
she came in my life at a point when i needed someone because i had lost myself and now when we were each others strength she left
how do you feel if you do not know you do not have to come up with an answer everyone is been telling me i am better off without him but i can not seem to let him go
so for me to feel depressed is almost insulting in a way towards people that do not have even half of what i have and this is not me bragging because i did not deserve most of the things that i got in my life it is just me thinking about how selfish i am that i feel bad for not having friends or whatever while there are people in my country even that do not know if they will have enough money for food tomorrow in order for them to not put their kids in bed hungry
i still hope this is just a bad case of seasonal depression and everything will turn out when i do not have to wake up into dark and dreary winter days
all i want is to sleep for a whole week straighti have been lonely my whole life but this time is different
in the simplest form letting go means becoming aware of a specific feeling letting it come up clutching to it tightly and then allowing it to flow away from us without judging it or wanting to change it
i am a 24yo male i live with my family i have a job i am not very social but i do have a small group of friends etc
i hd severe psychological trauma which basically got worse went untreated for several years due to shit kaiser therapy and neglect
he has struggled with mental illness to some degree through most of his life this is why i believe my parents so easily let him back in their home they have made comments and i think the same that these last couple of years if he did not live with them he would be homeless or dead he has not had a job for years
i am a server with asd adhd anxiety and depression i am a neurotic mess i knowi have been working for 6 almost 7 months now and i do not like the amount of changes happening the pay i am getting and the time i am yelled at or infantized
i do not have any trauma that i can recall that could because any of what i am feeling i have never felt suicidal never hurt myself never abused any substances and am medicated for my ocd and adhd
a week later we met up for a drink i just want to be held by someone i wish jjjeh would hold me
i have never been with someone i thought i would be with forever i knew we were young but i saw my whole life with him
edit plz do not take this the wrong way anyone i am not complaining i truly appreciate my family and everyone wishing me its just that everyone my age has a group of close friends they can trust and share secrets that they can not share with their families i do not mean to sound ungrateful
the bar is higher than ever for me to be the perfect child one who is not sad or tired most of the time the kind of girl who would without hesitation help anyone i am absolutely sick of it this was just a rant to get it off my chest so sorry if you stopped to read this
does anyone have any advice or has anyone been in this situation and overcome it i never knew how bad this feeling could be and how it could affect my well being but i am interested in any advice at all
i hope i did the right thingwhat would you like to see discussed tackled and advice onjust want to know what is the worst to expect
the cat dying was the last straw for me i went off my meds i was tried of playing peace keeper or being the man of the house
if you want to overcome lonleness and you are not sure how to do it send me a dm or comment i would gladly support you to achieve this goal
so what would it have been better if i just taken it lived separately and in hiding while you tended to your parents would it have been better if i was submissive and quiet
i know my family would be very sad about my death but i can not take this anymore i do not even want to be here for the good parts of life
so if we look at the definition of the word hurt which is another common thing physical pain or injury or physically injured so literally that where hurt stops
it broke me so much i had tears in my eyes for the rest of the day i do not want to do that to others
and i am not bragging but luckily for me this third breakup does not hurt as much as the previous one where she also dumped me
i do not drive live in the middle of nowhere in england no children no girlfriend lost my job because of covid19
i keep thinking about how soon i will be old and then dead about climate change i thought to myself just do it you have been running from everything work responsibilities society
hey guys for many years i have had depression and these couple of years i was feelin great but this year my anxiety has been over the roof because some events have happened that made me think of the future in a fearful way
for the last 10 years it was alright for like a year so that is a pretty poor ratio in my opinion
i was thinking of streaming every day so i could get a consistent audiencesome money but that is not happening if my pc is not connected to the internet
i just want to know what causes this how can i help thisthis might be an uncommon statement on this sub but i had a good childhood
i just felt so upset and betrayed by his actions that it has caused me to not want to date anyone period
i keep finding myself checking her twitter page to see that she will post stuff on there but not reply to my texts for almost an hour or longer
it was not to me to me that was the only source of anything social whatsoever and i naively believed that i would be fine in the end achievements career being extremely good in the end i would find the bonds the friends the loves the relationships the experiences all that truly matters in life
back to the point of this post i have felt disconnected with myself ever since taking the acid wish me luck everyone thanks for reading
and here i am alone more than three hours away from my family bawling on the floor by myself i would rather end it tonight then live through years of misery
i am bipolar 2 i need these medicationsjocko willink posted a video on youtube about having a warrior mentality through a breakup
thoughts that he is probably flirting with and sexting others break me from the inside he is literally on my mind all day
i really do not do anything other than play ps4 but i am losing interest and i will be on reddit unless i am working
i spent my life not feeling loved and alone and it is starting to get to mein my 26 years of life i have been told more times than i can count that i am pretty
my relationship with my family is so toxic and abusive and every day i am being guilt tripped and yelled at for everything i do
i then get the brunt of the abuse when i speak of the money woes at the current company i am told to essentially risk getting sick by moving and being in close proximity with another person for training at another trucking job i voice my concerns but get put down and ridiculed for not taking any risks to better my overall living situation despite the virus numbers not coming down
i just want a simple answer and solution even if it had to be dumbed down i can not stand living like this
people who have had help that made them feel worse do not want any more of the same it does not mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can not give them any comfort
its so hard being 19 and feeling like some sort of abomination i am trying to heal myself but i hate looking in the mirror and i have some demons from my childhood that seemed to decide to rummage through my mind this past year
i have had a lot of underlying issues over years found out by working with therapists and through institutions but these are a story for another time as i do not want this post to be endless
and honestly i am in no position to move on from her dating for me is really meaning full and i save my heart for the right people
why do i get so madupset when he opens my texts and does not respond even if i just send a stupid meme i am angry when i do not get a response
so it is not like i do not have anyone to talk to but i do not respond to them much i leave them on read or just reply with a sentence
i just wish i could be with someone that does not want to get the best of me i wish it my friendships or even companionships could last enough
the next morning though he texted me saying he wants me back even though it was pathetic for him at the same at least that is what he said
my baby daddy recently upped and left 3 weeks after our second daughter was born i am scared i could start doing something i have had so many close calls with
i guess i will just take a couple of pills call the police or something and say what i did go to the hospital and so on i am just sick of living like this and i want it to stop maybe i will actually die and it would be 10x better
we all felt lost in life especially in those bleak episodes that come from time to time making us so depressed
i thought maybe it was something i left behind from a long time ago my failure and gods inability to answer or help fuck him
the persons answer basically told me to shut up and just woman up and stop complaining i have a fucking right to complain
i was forced on this rollercoaster i do not enjoy the rollercoaster and no one is giving me any good reasons to stay on
maybe they have moved on because for them it was simply physical it was simply mental it was emotional spiritual or familial but for you what was it for you recognise the difference because when you recognise the difference it is not that it feels better but it is that you are not going to let that person who has moved on break you because you realise for them it was never as significant
i no longer have an allconsuming anger toward my ex i am also not trying to figure out ways i can change myself to get back together with her

i am not in a relationship big surprise and have not been for years i do not know if i want one or i just want someone i can express my emotions with but this feeling of needing a person in life whether its a girlfriend or an acquaintance just will never leave me and i have no idea how to shake it
my symptoms bother me a lot and doctors are not being able to diagnose anything that could because all of my symptoms
if you are doing these things because it is what you think you should do or because of any outside influences like me telling you to do it it is not selflove but if you do it unconditionally it is

it is such a soul crushing reminder of how alone you are in the world its a display of all the joy and happiness people can have and how far removed you are from it
she also said that maybe we can try something in the future if we are both solo but that its a long shot and that she would be happy for me if i would find someone who will love me

if anyone has any further questions that might help you better understand my problem i would be happy to answer them and i would be grateful for advice on how to bring this up without having it dismissed as just anxiety
i have just about had my fill of other peoples bullshit though do not mistake me i am far too spiteful to actively harm anyone but myself see if i opt out of this the people who did nothing but make me miserable will have the guilt of my suicide on their minds that thought alone makes me smile
i have to get up now though as i am in danger of dehydrating badly what pains me is that if something else happened i might have allowed it
technically things are ok i ate healthy i lost some weight but i feel like a sim just going through the motions and i think the alcohol medication made me paranoid at night
intrusive thoughts like i want to fuck ____persons name or any other unpleasant thoughts i go back in my bedroom and sit on my bed
should i say maybe her mother is the way she is because she is become toxic she is very defensive of her mother but on the other hand she seems confused about the situation obviously idk a lot about this situation and could be wrong about my thinking though we live in australia
i want a hug damn it and a good long laugh with someone would be nicei am a fairly simple creature love me unconditionally and i will love you back i do not know if articulating this here will help but i needed to work through downwardtilted feelings
i survived 2 heroin overdoses in august of this year so i am lucky and grateful to be alive and almost 3 months clean now
i started school this summer but i feel so stupid everyone keeps telling me how well i am doing but i fucking suck at understanding math and other essentials topics
i knew that he had noone to pull him out of his hole he does not have a close friend he confides in
i got dumped a couple of days ago by someone who i thought loved me but did not anymore we are both pretty young and just started college and thought we could make it work
i have severe anxietyocd and tourettes plus a few other things i have to deal with for example my ocd id different from most i obsess ab self harming myself until i can not take it and do it to myself my parents are abusive and i have struggled with suicide for a while i have been in the hospital a few times for suicide attempts before
however whenever i think about inviting my ex to dinner or something i remember my previous relationship where i was desperately buying gifts to my previous ex
then we went to a new mall i feel physically sick even just thinking about him talking to another girl like he talks to me
please help me and suggest me the best method my pm i will do it anyway if it does not succeed i will end up in a much worse state and my life will get far worse
i have been going thru bad depression this year due to my father and mother splitting up after 30 years of marriage
we still have contact though distant and casual she can not say if she wants to get back together in the future or not and does not like discussing the subject but likes to keep it casual for now
while i know they love and care for me i feel like i have no home i feel like an awful person for hoping a partial unhappiness for her because she deserves joy and happiness
all my energy goes to trying to stop myself from walking into the snowy forrest or grabbing the knife under the table
i try to watch surgery videos to scratch the itch without cutting myself open but it only works for so long
today i just failed in one of a long list college organization interview i failed everytime because my mental health botched all my power functionality
i told her i love her and i was making honest attempts to be better for her and our relationship but she said i was lying
i tell them everything openly and honestly and when i get home i really do everything i can to work towards a goal of feeling less this way i can not tell you to what degree i try for myself
17f i am tired of doing this nobody cares about me anymore and i have lost almost everyone i love i have been going to therapy for a few months started meds a month ago they were going great but a few weeks ago i just realized how lonely i am and i am always numbing or pushing away my feelings and i am tired
have you ever thought someone felt the same way about you as you did about them well this was my moment where the cold blast of reality slammed me in the face
what do i do am i mean for denying him this i want to know what he has to say but i know it will set me back in my progress again what if he wants to get back together
if you only knew your all i ever think abouti you only knew how missing you is going to be the death of me
apparently she put a post on facebook that was public which said the people she wants are not interested in her and the ones that are people she does not like
the thing is i do not really want my mom knowing because she will flip out she is obsessed with me being the perfect child
you never supported me never motivated me never congratulated my failures but instead perpetuated my weaknesses because i should not get complacent
to describe this loneliness i feel its like a hole in my chest more like a void that empty feeling you know but this friend made me realize how badly i need to get more people in my life to talk too that actually want to talk to me and such problem is i do not know how too
i do not know sometimes i think i would just be nice to talk to someone honestly someone who is not trying to help or fix me
he is still the love of my life but i recently told him my remaining feelings for him only to be shut down in a very cold insensitive way but i am realizing damn its his loss what are you blind bro lol sorry that is all have a great day everyone you are all beautiful inside and out
it is been like this for months and as the months went on i felt more and more like nothing like a numbing nothingness
her true colors have been peeking out over time but they really came out a few days ago in a tantrum via texts nothing overtly abusive but it was suddenly crystal clear that nothing had really changed
it is for the best i know that thinks had to end as we need to grow on our own and i know the sooner i expect things the happier i will be but
if he get happiness not enough it start slowly remind you about it so you start searching3 like me just think suicidal thoughts maybe even do one of them
7 i used to be able to realise deep down that these thoughts were not true lately not anymore i am hoping that gets better in the next few days because i am really running on empty
but that being said we also need days when we get off our own backs give yourself a hug tell yourself that everything is going to be okay and enjoy the celebrations
but nobody else called auntscousins uncles my older half siblings who all live far away with their own kids and husbands
my next laptop was a beautiful 13 inch machine with bronze colouring and silver accents one of the side panels was a bit loose however with a gap from the keyboard i tried to superglue it shut but instead got the glue all over the keyboard rendering it unusable
never really had a relationship or a really close friend i could open up to only just had friend groups and never had an actual real friend who cared about me
my only reason for living is the fear that if i end it someone i care about deeply might do the same thing
instead of just thinking about it show that you are more than this breakup that this breakup is only a block in the road
everytime i do i am reminded that these guys on pron sites are all getting laid and i can not even get a date and still have not had my first kiss and i am turning 24 next month

this stupid watching it from the present day eyes was the reason i gradually stopped to go to universityi have literally 0 purpose in life i have lost interest in everything i have ever enjoyed
or i get really upset when i do not hear from her fast enough it is uncontrollable sometimestired of being alive i can not handle this anymore
moreover i still told him and i asked him not to break up with me at this time but still he insisted
it is been 2 years since i have been in a relationship and i am deeply in love with her he is always there for me and he is pretty much all around amazing
and i have no idea how to do that considering i need someone is help physically and i have no one else
he said that it was because he could not handle one at the time as well as loss of feelings though not sure hes basically at a loss for feelings in general
if i do end up eating food my family makes i need to check everythings ok deconstuct sandwiches to make sure there is no spit or toenails inside wait until they eat and make sure they swallow do not eat what they do not have on their plate
the reason i write this article to share this to all of you who need this is because i have recently experienced it myself and now after a few months i become better and i figure that it is not easy to let it go and here are some of the things i do to improve the awful feeling i have felt along the way
hello i live at hong kong i always felt stress at school or at home i am kind of big in video games but my parents never agreed they believe that school is the only way to success if i said anything i researched they would say i am crazy not really they but mainly my mom
i did not realize how important this was until i found out that all humans need touch physical intimacy and sex to feel good
i remember there were nights when i would stay up crying until dawn where i just wanted to die where i just wanted to end this pain that i did not understand where it was coming from
it is hard to describe but i can not eat or drink anything or else i will be violently ill for the rest of the day
it is past midnight where i live i am not ashamed to say i attempted suicide what i am is disappointed in myself for not being successful
even i studied math i did very stupid mistakes i waste a lot of time and time but did not lost my humanity i always help people older or younger as much as i can
and tell him without mouth just through mind call our friend hes starts calling silently by phoneim looking to another one after sec and joking like hey why are you staying call another friend using your cigarette
whether it was going out being at school or just random waves throughout the day at its worst which was this summer i ended up dropping 30 pounds
i worked so hard for a bachelors degree that can not get me out of retail workeverything in my life has gone wrong
you could not open yourself up to me anymore you started to hide from me and not care how i felt about your lack of effort
the next night we get word that his kidneys are failingi have been struggling with anxiety and depression my whole life just restarted therapy and an ssri
it is been 3 weeks since my partner 26m and i 21f ended our 1 year relationship because he accepted an offer out of state
i am so sad so so so sad it hurts so bad how can i help myself when does the pain stop when does the sadness about the future stop
i reach my arms out to touch it but it disappearsi want to slice my fucking neck and have my adams apple ripped out
the day i found out that was the end of it i know he loved me or maybe loves me and i do too
friends really like to party but i do not like who i am when i drink so i did not like to hang out every weekend plus i had to drive about 30 minutes just to see them not into beer pong anymore at age 21 still trying to find purpose in life going to school and working full time after getting kicked out of army boot camp for asthma
i do not have any feelings for them but i like to look back at pictures just for laughs and giggles should i just throw it away
i do not like that not anymore and when i want to show them another things they refuse it and ignore it i feel really sad because i do not like them repetitive ways so i feel apart and disconnected
brief description my gf and i were together for 4 years living together the whole time planning to move out of state together planning in proposing to her and she broke up with me about a month ago
he sauntered in like an alley cat ready for monogamy i feel blessed to hold you and keep you all of these years
i can not stop thinking about it it is consuming my thoughts all dayi have caused so much pain and grief in my life and my family has suffered directly from this
i feel so bad i have been nagging my parents to take me since i was 10 and it is not helping me
if you convert my parents would accept you you should loose weight then my mother would like you study a master or a degree in the us so my dad can see your resume as someone with studies here and smart enough clean better because my mom is going to be picky on you cook better or even worst learn how to cook like my mom
i asked her to make it official and when i did something clicked and she was not the same as someone who is 21 and literally has no friends i was intrigued
besides no woman from my world even the best one ever imaginable can ever even approach one single smallest step to being able to be compared to not even speaking of complete replacing even for a planck time my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blannie fall in deep love with somebody and you will understand me although i do not believe in it for my love towards blanc is not even what is described with a greek word agape gods love towards humanity it is infinitely undepictably stronger and i have long since gotten used to believing that in my headcanon she loves me back not a single slightest bit weaker
man fuck the government fuck the education system fuck life and fuck everything i am 16 and my head pains as if my heart is placed inside my skull
hi i also feel very lonely but i will not share my story just yet i feel like i genuinely have no one
she said she still loved me but it was not enough but she wanted to stay friends she had been self isolating for a couple of weeks due to having covid
5 balancemind i am not struggling with emotional regulation and an undercurrent of feelings overwhelm me i have tried to kill myself in the past at times i felt so alone
i feel like if i got some answers i might be able to accept it and start moving on but i honestly do not know if he would talk to me
today i reached out to her and told her that i missed the baby so badly and that i know it is her choice as a mother if we could my daughters and i say hi to her
i want to live a life where i feel accepted for who i am not judged or ridiculed for the way i look
when he brought up breakup i feel so hopeless because i actually believed he would be the one i spent my rest of life with
here is a brief summary of the relationship we had for 1y 3moi googled some keywords related to what i was feeling and found an ok article
i lost a ton of weight running and exercising i finally graduated did not have time to write my diploma during the marriage but that is all there it is
he is just too nice to tell you that he is letting you down slowlyhello so long story short my body hates me
anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses or any other response that prolongs their pain from expert help may be covertly prosuicide
i am constantly looking out for her car when i am on the road and am always afraid that i will see her walking down the street holding the hand of some new guy
hope you liked this tiny excerpt full longform posts can be found right herehttpsmaxjancarcom on my blogi know i already feel he was very distant i asked if he is ok but he never really said anything
you know things that productive people do i just know that i can not do those things she told me i was a toxic person and that i was suffocating her i see that now
somehow i feel both like i want to end my life and also like i do not and in those fleeting moments of unsuicidal lucidity madness i try to find ways to save or at least prevent myself from what i might do
so i am not really fucked trying to write something like this on actual paper to give to anyone who cares about me because they do not exist
i just spent the last hour writhing the note to explain my family why i killed myself my nephews birthday is coming up and i think once i spend this last day with my family and him i will be ready to die he is the only thing keeping me here i want to see him grow up but that is not enough anymore and plus if i leave now chances are he will not even remember me because he is too young also the girl i like is starting to be distant and i am pretty sure she is going to leave just like everyone else so what is the point anymore
that being said whenever i see people saying that 2020 was the worst year ever i question whether this perception is true
it was like the universe had heard me complain about my loneliness in college but just made life easier to deal with rather than fix it
i had the money so i wrote her a check just to make shit go away make sure you have the proper mindset i had the wrong mindset going into it
i need help majorly yet no doctors have gotten back to me about medication for my anxiety and depression i always have these bad thoughts and this uncomfortable feeling in my chest like this pressure i can never get rid of it nor even be happy when this happens which is every single fucking day it is so annoying can someone please help on how to get these negative thoughts out of my head
so to help make it interesting i will make the zoom call more fun by playing games with my fam jackbox quiplash etc
so here i am posting a lousy doodle expressing myself on the internet i hope everyone else is okay today this is a bad drawing of my feelings i know i am no artist but when you have no one to turn to there is only so much you can do thank you and i am sorry if i have wasted anyones time
i never wanted to write a note but i owe them somethingit will not be enough but it is the best i can do
i have little to no motivation for days now they are aware about my friend but do not understand from random nerdy science talk to intimate ones on life
we still have quite a few mutual friends so i am giving it till the new year and if there is no response i guess i will have to ask someone to get her shit together
i promise when life will get worse i will kill myself it is scary but life is scarier thank you if you read all of this nonsense
think back to pictures of when you were a littttle one and close your eyes and remember that that little person is you
they only want to see a physical smile on your faceyou better put a smile on your face right now or elsethis is their thoughts
if you only knew i would go to the ends of the earth for youif you only knew how a picture of you will sooth me for hours
this is from a short film together alone keren that documents one womans experience with her first panic attack and how it affected her after
i just want to say i do not hate you i do not wish harm upon you i only hope the best for you
i am a really loving person and i want to i love this girl with all my heart and literally did everything i could to stay with her
should i just pick my most important issue and see someone for thathey guys i am 19 years old male i am an incel my middleschool love life was pathetic
i have incorporated it into my style and i have planned on making a career out of fashion so you can see how this is frustrating for me
help i am texting my ex rn i am feeling sad and lonely i feel i can not stop myselfi have had good days and bad days
obviously i only could say yes i went home then drank some gin i hated my family a little but hated myself the most
i have struggled with self harm drug use and behavioral problems due to the abuse and trauma i have faced as a child
i write until i have no thoughts left yet there is always the one at the back of my head saying what is your purpose motivation and goals and i can never know the answer i have used weed as a coping strategey to escape this reccouring thought idk i just feel empty
but what bothers me the most now as a 25 yearold is how he treats and disrespect my mom i see it clearly now it is to the point i hate him there is nothing i want more than her breaking up with him
he had also been bullied growing up differently i think in lotto you call this a double jackpot someone to test my limits
i never really had a group or friends in general for most of my life really and if we are talking about real genuine friends that you have a connection with then never to be totally honest
maybe i just brushed it off because life kept coming and i had to keep going i try not to think too deeply into my other self
i had wished her a merry christmas eve during the day yesterday and try to talk to her but she pretty much just left me on read
i have lost pleasure in things i used to enjoy i do not go out and try new things anymore i find that i will not because i do not enjoy them i know i am supposed to be having fun and there is nothing boring with the activity i am doing but i just feel numb and bored
i can imagine all the worst cases scenarios even if my ex and i are in good terms now i am stuck with this and i do not know what to do
years of trauma addiction heartbreak bpd and being so alone with fucking nothing fucking nobody has rendered me basically a social retard unworthy of love i have very few who love me and i am such a burden i cannot take this pain anymore this dull aching profound sense of anhedonia is killing me
it started off as a fwb situation but i could not just let her go be with other men i decided i wanted her and i wanted her bad enough to be in a relationship
i tried everything i would rub his back so he could sleep for a little bit i would massage him until my own arms hurt
so around a week ago one of my closest friends and i got into a bit of a fight and we have not talked since and recently my depression has gotten really bad and i have been having panic attacks recently but that is another story i want to text her tomorrow because it is christmas tomorrow and she is not with her family for christmas and i do not know what to say
but he does not seem to care so much for my siblings and i he lives with my grandmother and practically relies on her to care for us while we are with him
it feels like i am alone but i know i am not it feels it is not allowed to talk about it but it should
i have no useful skills and when i lose my job i will not be able to pay rent everyone i know is doing so much better than me and i can not even take care of myself
people say the purpose of life is to have a good time or to reproduce and have a family and become successful but why why do we need to do that what does it do
well he is been subtly hinting that maybe we could get back together that he just needs some time that i need to work on myself
there is a lingering uneasiness in my mind about this day because it is a reminder of my lonelinessof my failures of not being like others
i cut my wrist veins until my bath water was red my blood coagulated and stopped the bleeding at some point
he later assured me that he just wants to see the other two guys because it is hard to pin them down but since then i have had a lot of trouble finding any peace
god has been so kind to give us such a beautiful life do not waste it for someone who does not value your thoughts
i just want to be happy but it is not happening and it looks like it never will i do not know what to do
he replies to stories on instagram and asks me how i am doing and what is going on with me he talks to me in a very normal and friendly way
i feel trapped in another country i can not go back to my country because of covid i am trying to support my family my brother i suggested them to visit a therapist but they do not take any action i send money every now and then i send gifts to make my family happy but i am alone here i work 6 days a week to save money for them
i can not have a job or even to to school without endless pain ontop of my ibs i have shitty parents
whether going to be homeless or somehow ending up rich i am not returning to these bastards or giving them a cent
when we met it was clear we were meant for each other we had similar interest similar taste in musicmovies and we would talk untill deep in the night
our coaches are awesome and we have done a lot of live events as well she never wanted to have sex but she would be mad if i took care of myself
instead i just feel like i have nothing to live for and i often find myself wishing i had not gone to the hospital last year when i went into dka
it is just making my feelings worsezhello everyone i recently remembered that i had a lots of difficulty to socilaze 2 years ago
but maybe it helps to finally move on and especially the last maybe is enough reason to me to do so
we continue talking all day every day slowly progressing from snapping and texting to facetimes i am an artistic person and i loved what she brought out of me
one of my colleagues28f confessed her interest in me and i initially told her about my relationship and how much i loved my girlfriend
have just resigned myself to i am a solitary soul but deep down i know i am lonely i blame it on social anxiety disorder but maybe i am just an uninteresting twat
normally in the evening like this i would have been contemplating about how nobody cares about anyone anymore and how did i ended up with nobody to talk to but myself but not today
observation and past experience seem to imply that yeah other people do feel this way they just like the feeling of being together
this is not a troll post either i am legit a insane hypochondriac i am not sad i am not feeling anything of that sort at the moment
she did and no sooner than they had started dating he wanted to break things offnot sure sure how long i could lasthopefully one day and soon there will be zero hesitation
i feel like i have given so so much emotionally and physically to this relationship i can not let it go i think he is made a rash decision in his grief
i did not want to think of it like it is right now but it is after he just unadded me on all social media
i think of that day when i have thoughts of getting back together with youi feel so terrible and i can not blame you for what you did at all
i am currently a 4th year medical student and right now it is the examinations period i will be having the most important and hardest exam of my life on monday but guess what my only friends that i usually confide to decided to leave me all of a sudden they just disappeared ignoring my texts and cries for help kicking me out of various group chats
i eventually called him and asked why things felt so weird after he canceled on seeing me and if he wanted to continue things with me
needless to say i miss the good times i miss having a companion who shares my tastes for the most part
how do i get rid of this i want to live my day without thinking about it how can i do this
i have no other online or irl friends i do not connect well with others i do not have anything in common with others do not fit in anywhere socially
maybe i am cynical or a loner or antisocial i do not know i just feel good and confident so i am on my last dime and might have to borrow from parents just to pay rent
and i will always be cheering for your success and praying for you cheersthis year has just been absolutely terrible started with me getting out of a todic relationship
weeks letter we meet up in person to talk about our relationshipi guess i have to do it on my own
even then something broke for several weeks i just felt bad and then everything calmed down or so it seemed to me
to avenge me for breaking her love triangle as i could not bear it anymore she pretended to start fresh promises again
it is midnight i have slept all day and i am bored i am new to reddit so you get to hear thisi have 28f been dating this amazing guy 25m for four months after liking him since march 2020
my bipolar episodes has definitely taken a hit because usually i feel more manic than depressed but now i feel the opposite is this normal is it normal that my head is hurting a lot and i am not exactly interested in doing any sort of work or listening to anyone in my family i feel like a robot at this point in my life i do not exactly feel anything good
for the past 5 days i have run in my head over and over what i should have done differently talked so poorly to myself because i lost you and could never forgive myself for the mistakes i made
ok stop it put your hands behind your head and stop what you are doing for a second treat this as a wakeup call if you are bugging your ex about why your relationship failed
my dad and sister both have pretty bad anxiety but i do not get anxious much i am starting to reach a point where i do not know what is wrong with me i am wondering if i can get depression from people in my family with anxiety i know anxiety and depression is often genetic so if anxiety runs in the family then i would be more likely to have it but what i am wondering is can depression stem from anxiety in family genes i am not sure as these are two different illnesses if anyone has any ideas please comment because i am really unhbappy and do not know what to do thanks
now we are at a point where we talk every day the thing is my ex is moving states away in a month
he did not believe me when i said i was sick and was not there emotionally for me i ended up in the hospital for a month
after the fallout from each attempt i am honestly more scared of failure than dyingif i could take a magic pill and never wake up i would i font know what to do
i got a little obsessed over the way i looked and could definitely notice the attention from girls in my class
all i have ever wanted was true friends that i just clicked with but i am nearly 22 and i am starting to think that will never happen
it started at 19 i am male and just got into college my problem was that i was paranoid because i school not too far from home and i think that is what started the whole series of problems i had
to make things even worse our university management decided to conduct offline exams and i am a mess right now it feels like i am the only one who has not started preparing yet
i will probably use the plastic bag over the head method it is fast not that painless and definitely not 100 percent lethal with a high risk of permanent brain damage but there is no other way
they were my friend before they were my lover and when i lost my lover i lost my good friend kind of way
i do not know how to say even to myself that i am not doing well without feeling whiney but the desperation and frustration for being ignored by my own wife got me mad
the last year i have been struggling with night terrors on and off it is made me late to work lost jobs etc
i depended on my ex emotionally so not talking to him or telling him when i am upset is a big deal for me
i have been going to the hospital frequently for the past 11 years for brain tumors with my first cancer tumor this year
what could you do about it you can not control all of your thoughts and it makes no sense to take responsibility for their power of telepathy
in her eyes because i work in marketing i am doing something untraditional and she does not bother even pretending to care about what i do because i am now selfemployed she thinks that i need to urgently fix my failing career and because of my income not being in the lawyer tier she treats me like some sort of undignified failure the only type of people she tries to associate with are upper class
the hardest part was when she said and decided that we could no longer be friends because of the feelings i still had for her they were complicating things yes i do understand
i made a post here when i got out of icu on monday that i do not want to die anymore and i feel like i could handle my problems however after the last few days my mind has gone back to my original train of thought i do want to die and kill myself i just will not do it right now and i will not turn to pills as a method ever again
i broke contact again and even blocked him on all social media the thing is i live in a small village so everyone knows each other
i am always afraid to talk front of people or to make a presentation whole of my life i tried my best to avoid doing those things
she also said that she felt as she had nothing other than me in the city we live so she will be moving away with her family
i do honestly think i still loved him though i would not have forever we could have comforted each other through this long winter had so many more special happy times
mostly because he is mentioned that i do not really make many sacrifices due to my mental illnesses multiple times i am worried that this is internally making him uncomfortable and he is not telling me and maybe that will harm our relationship
i tried getting involved in the cosplay community to make friends but had little success i am looking for friends on here now because i am losing it
last time it was second time i dreamed someone i never met in person as my friend i was walking to some event and there was a local journalist standing and i greeted him and he responded as if he knows me to my huge surprise i feel so pathetic and sad ah
no one fucking knew about my first 2 attempts i try to give a decent goodbye and explain myself but no i am just attention seeking no i want to fucking die
i am relatively wealthy and should be set up for the perfect life despite this i feel a sense of lonely and dread
i would feel bad writing that except i am pretty sure they want out of here as well after all i did i was not even allowed to sleep with him
then ask yourself is this thought helping me to elevate or escape notice we have just created an acronym called life
he said he could not see me as much anymore but that he did not want to end thingstldr dumped in ltr 5yrs girlfriend was my source of my happiness
i know it is not the answer to my problems i know the pain it would because for my family her family and my kids
i did not succeed and was handcuffed and shoved into a cop car as we drove off my neighbors watched in shock
this happened 2 times and i do not know what happened to fair sad because i miss them and wish they could have continued
i am currently unemployed and broke i have tried to commit suicide about a month ago but i do not have the balls to do it
i have no friends currently and i live away from my family i do not know how to improve my life or become happy again at least a little bit
just a horrible message filled with anger and accusations and because i am already struggling so much with my mental health that is pure poison for me
everyday i wake up feeling so blessed for my life and for everything in it i did not need him to be happy
this guy was not the most normal kid in high school so when he said he was awake to all of it i figured maybe he was going through some mental health issues back then and is better now but then this whole situation turned super weird
i think of my family that i ruined and left i think of my parents that are the ones who will find me motionless
i am happy i do not really care what strangers think about me because after that i would be embarrassed to leave my house ever
but to be honest even if you have a healthy and nurturing relationship with yourself will you be saved from the slow sinking feeling of loneliness
my family are supportive and i am generally a happy person yet still i have severe anxietyi wanted to kms for years now but tonight i might actually do it
oh the mother fcking irony fast forwards this was a blessing she was a liar an hypocrite a very hateful person who was unable to forgive anything but i am still hurt because i did loved her and now that love is broken not only that but she systematically destroyed our memories together with lies and hateful words i cannot go back and think of those beautiful days anymore because she decided to break them
i am not asking for any help or advicewhy was i cursed i do not know but i know i do not want to live like this anymore
i woke up crying my head wants me accept this so badi have no siblings to share my traumatic experiences withmy cat died horribly right in front of my eyes
because i had seen him a lot until a month before i also got tested and yes i had the same stds
all she said was it was your toxic behaviour that led to this now we argued occassionly i always handled it worse admittadly but we moved past them i learnt i got more patient more understanding each time
one of the main reasons why i ended things was because he put his needs above mine too often he was really struggling mentally but despite my best efforts over the last few years i could no longer put his needs above mine
it is in those moments i feel inhuman an alien or being among the rest of people yet i never feel better than anyone
i am almost 21 completely dependent on my family 2 years behind in school the next 7 years of my life will be occupied with school amp work
because that video showed how much he did love me the way he looked at me and smiledi think soon will be time where it will happeni can not do it anymore
if they were not in my life i do not know if i would still be herei think that the little signs of affection are more important than we use to think
i have just realised that i truly really am alone in life i might have my family and a few friends but i am alone i really am i only have 2 so called friends but 99 percent of the time they are only there to ask help they only contact me when they need something from me
it feels like if someone tells you that they really love you and you do not feel the same way so any advice on how i can fare without destroying the progess that he made thanks a lot
sometimes at night i think i am going to finish the ones i am halfway through and go end myself but then i finish them and in that little moment i am excited enough to do a million more and tired enough to go to sleep
but on the tuesday she sent me a breakup message when i was asleep which i had to wake up to on wednesday and process the whole thing at work
i am so detached from my emotions i do not feel anything no sadness no pain and no happiness just existing but i just cried for a bit now and felt slightly depressed been thinking about suicide for a while and i was wondering if it is easier to just do it when your feelings depressed
my depression will not get better because my body is not working properly and no medication was able to get rid of it
during coronas begining i was diagnosed with gbs and quickly lost the ability to move anything but my eyeballs while in a private hospital in tbilisi georgia
and she suddenly became so active compared to how she acted before and now she posted a story with another guy and it is only been 3 weeks
over the past few months things that have interested me just does not seem to be exciting to me anymore i used to enjoy music playing the piano photography going hiking or trekking outdoors watching movies netflix youtube etc
also i thought i would say this because maybe it could be my potential mental disorder manifesting itself i used to create fake profiles for no malicious intentions whatsoever except to make friends and experiencing what life would be like if i was that person as i have endured a long history of bullying from my own family and friends
over the past few years a lot of bad things happened in our family around christmas too my grandpa got a toe amputated due to diabetes one year we had to put our dog down after he bit my mom so bad she bled the next year etc
i am amazed at how evil people are i mean all i want in the world is just to be cared about but people refuse
he spent the night i think i am okay from it but i am not sure what this means our brain want dophamine and make it in cosmical doses any way he need it
anyway my question is this do you really want to die or do you just wish you had something to live for if i am being 100 honest i just want something to live for i really just want someone who will love me just for being me
i am resuming therapy tomorrow so this is definitely going to be the core thing i focus on but i thought it might also be useful to sound out reddit for advice
on that note thanks a lot for taking the time to read my post i hope to hear from you soon
we were going to spend the rest of our lives together we wanted to have kids i prolly should have created a burner account
what are your thoughts on him moving on so quick and to someone much younger my ex who i thought i could trust just made me completely end things with her
i am doing the worst in school i have ever done and i just can not seem to get any work done i waited too long to apply to colleges and now i am screwed
when i started calling that behaviour out for what it was i knew breaking up was the right thing to do
she felt like the problems around my family overshadowed her own problems and that she lost a great amount of freedom and her own identity
edit i did not even get to my point sorry i am baked and rambling in ts but i am not who i was before i started smoking i have lost a lot of personality i am going to from depression but i am unsure if i never started smoking i would not be alive now that is all that got me thru some of my roughest patches and i do not know how to get myself back i feel empty metaphorically and physically my whole body feels empty at points and i lose motivation to do anything at all
as a result of the ongoing global pandemic rates of alcohol and drug use both pharmaceutical and otherwise are skyrocketing along with obesity against a backdrop of stress fear isolation and actual or potential economic scarcity more and more of us are developing maladaptive coping mechanisms like binge eating binge drinking and compulsive use of technology even when we know that these actions will have adverse effects on our physical and mental health
but i have always been raised to be respectful to women be nice caring loving and always be willing to be supportive
i hate going to bed alone and i hate waking up alone i want to be the person someone is heart beats for and i want to fall asleep every night holding each other with my head buried in their chest as they run their long finger nails through my hair
i am pissed at the fact i am pissed i do not think i am really a bad or boring guyi can not believe i am here i just feel so empty inside
it will be getting better but then my anxiety makes me get constipated or anxious enough to have diarrhea i feel massively ugly and am paying for my bad decisions now
i fell into a hole myself i stopped going out and got depressed i am really glad that i have an amazing flatmate that was there for me through it all
been single for about a year and have always been super insecure about myself not having a girlfriend could not work up the nerve to talk to another girl this year really
a week after this convo he broke up with me i stayed the night because it was a 3 hour drive home and the next morning had a mental breakdown and he just sat there watching tv
i do not want people trying to dm me and become my friend either whether because they are lonely themselves or because they feel bad for me friendship is a twoway road it needs two people to come together and work to maintain a relationship with each other and loneliness or momentarily feeling bad for someone make for very poor foundations on which to start relationships
i never thought that at this stage i would still be all by myself i talk to people online but it is not the same as having a connection irl
this is not the first time i have tried to kill myself and frankly i am seriously worried it will not be the last
i rejected all of them i am not getting into a relationship out of desperation it is all with online things and i freak out about stuff like malware and people stealing my accounts
i am sleeping fine i go to bed around 1011 pm and do not wake up much during the night however i do not eat a ton of food a day so that could be affecting something i just feel full after eating around half a sandwich so i do not feel like i need to be sustained by a lot of food
at the time it was just me and my dad already we had a guinea pig it is indescribable what effect this disease has had on me mentally and physically
it took her literally 20 minutes to end a 3 year relationship and another 15 minutes after that call to get into another relationship with my best friend
i relive the heartbreak every single week the worst is that it is given me so much anxiety that i still over think every word he said
i starve myself eatting once a week to avoid as much pain as possible i struggle to sleep no one bothering us because they did not understand us but even then
i m21 recently just had a break up with the first person f20 i had a relationship with though it was not yet official it was already going in that direction as what i thought
then he starts to get drunk and yelling at people and causing a scene and i tried the times that i could to calm him down and he got aggressive with me and everyone else that tried to help him
something that will just remind me that there is good news out there i saw one about how the elephant population has doubled and i cried for ages over it
i have been wanting to kill myself for weeks now if not months i have been thinking about it a lot and i was waiting for christmas to maybe cheer me up make me see that life is worth it or something
i am just telling you part of my story just to let you know you are not alone there is a lot shit during our way and we will step on it clean it up and keep walking my buddy trust me there is an exit another one not the fake one we want to use have cojones to talk about it go by yourself to the hospital do not make the same mistake as me go and cry like a baby you can not imagine how nice you will feel
i feel like such a dickhead for breaking up but i felt like a dickhead if i stayed i just wish she did not buy me anything i did not want her to get anything
i am not really close with my brothers in all honesty but i fear that if this were to happen my brother would end his life and i am not the right person to help him as i am pretty blunt and honest by nature and would most definitely do more harm than good
with that being said i just wanted to extend a simple invitation for a friendly message if you are lonely during the upcoming holidays go ahead and reach out to me
i could not tell you how many opportunities i have missed passed up because i doubt myself so much i never win arguments even when i know i am right because i just have no confidence in anything that i do or say
i feel like it is not right to forget them and go on with my life like nothing has happened that does not just go away
and we did he visited me in my country during the summerrealize that your life is limited ponder on death and what you will do before she gets to you
do not have hobbies friends at all no interests really and do not have a clue on what can help me feel better
but i am doing what is best for me right now i neglected my own mental health for someone who was always in it for themselves
i have lost numerous ppl in the last few months most bc i am too much i was completely shattered to my heary i holded some tears
every day i open my eyes i want nothing more than to go back to sleepi am so tired of my life right now
three quarters of my close friends are abroad this semester and i am not into the typical party scene which is actually pretty sparse on my campus not a party school
how i am going to quit drinking get into therapy how i want to build on our communication and work on meditating together everyday
i see so much disappointment and disgust in his face nothing is good enough the most striking symptom is absolutely out of nowhere having thoughts pop in my head about suicide
the last decade have been really hard in many ways and some people have been there for me which i feel big gratitude for
i wondered if i was going to die and i was fighting between wanting to die and not wanting to i felt sick and at one point wanted to vomit partially to rid myself of the meds
and second see ppl say that i am the exact opposite of what i am i am also tired of faking that i am ok
i have not cried in a pretty long time and can not think of many things that are likely to happen that would make me feel emotional
i started going out less and i went back to my old self this kind of lifestyle was simply not for me
i feel like the only thing left for me is to die but i am too coward to kill my self
i can not blame her for moving on and blocking me it was the right thing to do in her situation i asked if we could still be friends and she sent a picture of her and her new man telling me that we were never a thing and that i need to move on so i did and responded with just hope your happy
i started talking to another friend i had in middle school but i am afraid i am driving her away tooi do not think my brain can take all of the negativity i have to deal with
the fallout from this was that eventually i moved again escapism coping strategy again the same thing it was exciting for a while but i eventually realised that i could not escape myself i floundered around for a few years failed and crappy relationships here and there but never really understood what was wrong
i have the right to enjoy my favorite meal i do not have to feel guilty about i can enjoy it if i want to
i have been having these thoughts for years and they are only getting worse i need them to stop what should i do
we ended up driving the same way my ex and i used to ride on his motorcycle once i realized it i was so overwhelmed and sad that everyone could tell i i was off
the laboratory for the study of anxiety disorders at the university of texas at austin is conducting a no cost intervention study examining how mindfulness may reduce feelings of loneliness
i do not think there is anything wrong with mental health issues but i have grown almost resentful of dating those that refuse to get help for it if they are able to as it always creates problems
that inner negativity of a girl not confident in her partner whatever you helped me out in a lot of ways
what you can do when you have been lonely your entere life cuz you do not like most of people i am tired the emptiness and loneliness is killing me
she is not bad though it is just that she or does not love me or does not know how to demonstrate love but she does the second with her boyfriend so i believe it must be the first thing
past relationships were toxic and of course failed online dating is not for me have you all seen the movie edge of seventeen that movie was insanely relatable
i had a good schedule of sleeping and exercising but i have started sleeping so late so i can fall asleep immediately and not have to lay with my thoughts in silence
my situation is that i am the type of person who can bounce from group to group and really feel like i am part of the group but i am never like the starter
exercise fairly consistent haaard haaaaaaard and fun workouts very fit 910 destination clear sense in general somewhat clear but not certain specifics
i have been getting abused since i was a toddler both physically and emotionally and by different members of my family over the years
i was in a long term 8 year long distant relationship with this guy until he dumped me a week after my birthday this year for another person that was also long distance
i hate myself for reacting this way it was not even that badalso i feel like scum for even thinking this but it sucks to not get anything for christmas
i am nothing but a burden people say they love me but i feel like they would not really care if i was gone
at least i hope this bring you some peace i know you already are over the break up but i know too that the way you choose to end things may bother you
make fun of my failed career my lack of money despite the fact i am 21 and at a top uni how i am a peice of shit terrible at everything i do try to get in my head
it started out with a manic scarification project and then the next time it was slashes under my breasts over my ribs and on my lower stomach just above the nethers
4 i hope that after four years we can continue our relationship in some fashion and form working on us in some way
for the past 2 years i have been feeling like people who i do not personally know could be celebrities or people i used to like or just random people in general are watching me at home when i am by myself or with my family and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities going to the toilet gross
i have seen so many bad things happen to many people just because they were ugly or unattractive seeing him like that broke me further
two days later i return home and i find out he left the country went back to his i was devastated
i am in such a bad state i resent myself so much for not having my life sorted out while she has a rewarding degreedriven career has made friends and is actively searching out new experiences i am stuck thinking about how i am not good enough for her how much time i have wasted in the past
listen to it everyday and every moment you have and master the song when you feel the internal dialogue being too much that its stressing you out
i can not and do not ever want to imagine you with someone else the very thought makes me so sick to my stomach
today i sold her wedding ring that she gave me when she left when i first bought her that ring i worked a few months of double shifts making 9 an hour
they would not see her this week because i sent her out of state to be with my mom thinking it might help her to get a change of scenery
i begged and pleaded for almost 3 weeks for him back i spammed and flooded him with long messages about how i feel and how i am fixing things
when we exercise after a break up we build our confidence not just for looking better but feeling better from eating right taking care of ourselves
my mom is very very conservative she has a vision in her mind of how i should act behave and look as her son
is just unfair with my cat and my dad mostly my cat she is my whole life i think once she dies i will do that meanwhile i will just snort another one
at around 5 on the 8th my girlfriend wanted to do a zoom call just her and i she needed to talk so i got up the zoom call and waited for her to get on
i feel like that statement is just wrong and there are people that are more or less attractive and i am just the second of these two
i do not have prior mental health problems or issues this is all strange to me and i do not know what to do
but the more i saw him the more mysterious he did i really do not need to your guys support or encouragement and please do not tell me to see a psychologist
i have major depression and generalized anxiety disorder and i do not know how to cope with this anymore it seems like he wants to leave me for good
i am fortunate in that i still have a job but am averaging 5560 hour weeks and have earned next to no time off
so basically i felt like all the blood was rushing to my head like when you hang upside down for too long i was kind of freaked out for about a day and a half but ever since i have calmed down i have been different
i truly came to the conclusion that i was an incel and i still stand by that today i am an incel
i keep asking myself if i should have just taken my seatbelt off seconds before we crashed and let life takes it course
shit hurts do you know what i mean friends its not physical but it is i hope you understand because i do not know who else would
we were in some run down club that had staircases that reminded me of expensive old houses any who you know me getting off track as usual focussing to the details
in all cases it was terrible but maybe that with many other people was the worst because there my low social skills were so blatant in a contest where everyone knew each other and was friendly with everyone else but not me

maybe some of you have a problem that someone else has already overcome and we can share some tips but he did not reciprocate nearly as much
there is nothing wrong with me i feel overwhelmed with all this situation and i do not know what to do to feel better

my parents have always been there for me anytime i need help or advice they will be there i remember show my mom cool skate tricks or listening to old rock with my dad i have seen them get older and older it breaks my heart to see them with grey hair i want to spend every moment i can with them sad that people die even the ones that have been there forever
i just keep reinforcing in my head that it is too late for me that i will never catch up that i am too weird and too far removed from what people look for and go for in dating these days
i am pretty good at psychologyrelated topics it is been an interest of mine since an early age but when it comes to identifying psychological issues involving myself it will be nearly impossible to think clearly
at my first school i had a total of 2 friends they ended up ditching me and i was left with none
i keep telling myself i am okay that i am doing fine and i am doing better i keep telling myself that i deserve better than you
we told each other we did not want to lose each other as friends but we both agreed that we especially me needed time to heal

it did not matter how bad he treated me i wanted to be with him no matter whatwhen she said it was over i did not beg for her back nor did i reach out
please try and take this post as nonbiased and as indiscriminate as possible i do not want to experience observational bias as that would rock my world more than it already ishas and i am very impressionable and vulnerable
i do not plan to ever leave this world in such a way so nobody needs to panic honestly i am the type of person who would just go on despite the beatings
i have to serve people who are in control of their lives and enjoying it everydayi have sent over a hundred applications for different jobs and still am
i have always believed and still do empathy kindness and mercy to be humanitys greatest virtues and did my best in acting accordingly to such beliefs no matter what
i am almost changing my diet to liquids only bc of that and i do not know what to do in this case
i am so touch starved it is crazy i day dream about someone hugging me hugging pillows rarely ever helpsi do not know what to do my friends are not affectionate plus it is covid and i could never hug my mombecause our relationship is not so good there is got to be away to stop feeling this way
i am not the real social type of person i usually only go outside to go to class eat and showergo to the bathroom
i know it is not and i have no reason to feel guilty i just miss them and the whole friend group they took all our mutuals with them
i never knew family love because my step dad was a homie his friends where homies i had rules i had a back to watch and i was protecting myself
gaslighted me throughout our entire relationship and i felt like he enjoyed seeing me cry he enjoyed seeing my pain because he had control to soothe it afterwards
i am without a doubt hypersexual i have started to impulsively talk about sexual things and struggle to remove thoughts about some seriously harsh fetishes from my head it has become debilitating and potentially problematic it stems from relationship trauma and porn addiction i had as a very young teen i am also trans and i am self medicating will i be able to bring my hormones and anti androgens with me
her effort was finally matched she said it is been awhile since she said stuff like that too it is always my friends from middle school always reminding me of how shit i am
after two days you have said it you were scared but you have said it sorry you were my best friend
i unfortunately still love her very much and do not know what to do because i would really like to be friends with her at some point and re add her on social media
hi guys i can not take this loneliness anymore pandemic certainly does not help but it is mostly because i have fewer friends each year it hurts every time i tap on my phone expecting someone to text me even to tell me about their life just sharing stuff with me every time all i can see is my wallpaper blank
something happened that has really messed me up i am not sad about the event itself anymore but upset about the ramifications of it
i want to be there for her but i feel so far not to mention we are waiting on our covid results in my household my parents would not be keen on me leaving right now
the highs are not even worth the lows anymore i am tired of getting rid of the thoughts just for them to come back a few months later i have not had 6 consecutive months without these thoughts in the past 4 years i am sorry to the people who tried to help me in the past but you failed and so have i at least i will finally be able to rest peacefully if i succeed
first of all i want to make it clear that english is not my first langusge so i am sorry for the misstakes
but now as i am just shy of 4 months from the breakup i am just looking for clarity on how the hell you are supposed to carry on with life
no parter struggling to cope with work suddenly quite friendless and very very lonely and without much vision for my future
but when we were at round eating dinner everyone else was happy but i had this overwhelming feeling of sadness and i wanted nothing more than to just be alone where nobody could see or hear me
walking out of work today and saw a group of my coworkers hanging around talking to each other i cried because i had never had a nice break up before most of my previous endings were messy
in the end it would have worked out like it was supposed to do not be afraid of the unknown there is more to come
i want to not give a fuck about people and watch the world burn fuck human beings and fuck my ex who looks so fucking happy with her fiancé
i feel so lonely and low and i feel so awful and i feel scared and i feel conlicted i just want answers
3 months later she broke up with me saying there was something missing but she was not sure what it was so could not tell me
getting constantly put through so much emotional and physical damage has worn me down too much i just do not have anything to keep me here so why should i stay here
i was going through a filter and script mirroring behaviors of tv characters to be likeable but my anxiety involved with it caused me to feel lost on who i am and not being able to find my own connection or flow with myself
i miss him terribly and l wish so much everything was like it used to be but the difference i did not want things to end
he reached out few days ago and asked me do you still think i cheated or are you interested in another guy and do not want to talk to me anymore
i do not think i am suicidal but i keep finding myself thinking about it i keep writing the note and planing how i would do it shit ton of acetaminophen in a running car with the garage door closed and gun shot to the dome
she is the more positive kind of person and i was more the negative and realistic person in life we had some small arguments about stupid stuff and the last argument made her decide to leave
i miss having that and i want to have it but i can not find anyone to love at all no one has even remotely crossed my mind as pretty or cute or funny or partner material which makes me sort of lose hope i want to have someone special to think about a one day crush at least i have not found that and i am starting to feel really upset about it
i might make another post about this later just to recollect my thoughts and make it more coherent i went to extreme lengths something i do not think you truly appreciated
i started loosing actually maybe i never found it my sense of identity over the years i did not go anywhere or even have friends of my own he was everything i had
she said that i should decide whether to continue or break up with her like why should i be the one to end it i said let us give it another try
what can i do to make an overdose worse please helpthought what it would be like if everyone was as depressed as me

though i have a job its my first i cannot really go back right now due to a lot of factors
so 4 months later i go back to my psychiatrist because i am tired of how my poor mental health hygiene is and i feel like i need to try
he lives as a roomate so he used to say they do not like kids at the hosue to my mom never gave a reason to me
this is just too much to take i tried a couple of things over the past few months but nothing works anymore
that was it but then he started acting cold so i asked him about it and he said nothing just that i was bothering him
it hurts but it feel like the pain will not last many months i asked him to unfollow her and he agreed but has not which makes me so upset

now i am in my mid 20s and i literally have no one i recently broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years and not going to lie i expected some comforting
i suggested a break for him to figure things out he did not want one or to break up he came around to the idea the same time i regretted the fact i suggested it
i know i am a minor but i am sadly a part of a society that does not prioritize mental health for kids nor adults or teens there is so much stigma surrounding it
should not the pinned for for such a long time in your minds eye having rehearsed the lines you were to say over and over again in a meetings chance evaporate like thin airseem oddly disturbing if we were programmed for winning

we get so wrapped up and dependent on them for who we are that we feel broken but this is a mindset shift we have to make

to live in a house together and be happy because she is so good at making me happy and forgetting all my problems and i feel so safe with her and i am a whole different person when we are in our own world talking and we are meeting by the end of 2021 but it is getting harder and harder to keep going

i am currently completing my thesis on the potentials of online communities such as reddit for the resilience of older adults
recently a sibling became severely ill and it has shaken our family to the core fearful that we will lose him
i have also been losing motivation and my interests in doing things i have been sleeping so long recently i do not know if it is just my body recovering from school work and sht or if it is my only happy place which it kind of is i do not find pleasure in doing things that previously made me happy
i have a couple friends people who know everything about and are close i had people like this before too pushed them all away have not seen talked to them in years
they do not seem related to our relationship and might be about his personal life i am torn between reaching out or not last contact was still recent he is still not into talking if i reach out does it prove that i love him or only that i am an idiot
i gave up on the concept of making friends a long time ago so therefore the people i had in my life slowly dwindled until i was deserted once again

i have come a really long way with my mental health my problem is i feel like something is deeply wrong with me that i will never fix
what do i do working from home is very isolating he claims to still love and care for me but his actions show otherwise
but i want you to know this everything may still freaking hurt in our hearts and souls as we long for someone to genuinely love or to be friends with especially during covid times but besides all this hellscape we are going through as the quote from undertale goes despite everything you are still you the fact you are still here means you still have the strength to keep going even if you do not believe in yourself for those who feel like you are a burden to your loved ones you are not you are loved by them even if your brain lies to you
i wholeheartedly believed i was going to marry you someday we were going to have two dogs a cat a rabbit and fish

we have to recognize that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment unless there is loyalty unless there is love patience persistence
the popular joke says men only want sex but honestly i just want someone to hug when feeling down i want someone who cares enough to ask if i am ok
2 i asked him today if he was moving on from me because he found someone else and he straight up looked me dead in the eye and said no another lie he found someone after going on a little family trip a few days ago and has been texting her she asked him to go and see her but because i was over he said he could not leave because i was there how thoughtful
i am thinking about doing it way too long i should have done it years ago it is time to go i can not go on anymore i can not fight anymore i am done it is time to go
i am ready my 20s are over it is time to make a final decision fighting suicide does nothing once i accept my death i can prepare for it and have something real to look forward to at last
since i was 13 i have never ever felt motivated like i used to before i was a very motivated and a confident dude back then
sorry i promise the religion talk is relevant so anyway i was indoctrinated into this belief system and only found my way out earlier this year
it is been four years since i have no connection with her i talked to her three or four months in 2016 after that her father got caught her when she was talking to me on phone then the relationship has been ended
i hate going out to parties where everyone talks over each other and no one listens the more i socialise the lonelier i feel
hello it has been almost 2 months since my breakup after dating for 1 year i talk a lot of shit about and make myself seem confident but i am not
this spring i saw her social media and realized she was blaming me for being abusive requests an appointment to discuss a new symptom
i am miserable life for me is an everlasting game that repeats everyday life just kicks you in the ass no matter what you do
they kept stressing the point that i need to be honest with them so that they can help me but the truth is i can not
fyi not taking any kind of drugs used acid and made me better for a few months then back again
people tell me i am a hot mess i know i am very smart but i can not handle my own brain anymore i was diagnosed with ptsd depression and anxiety in august my grades have dropped i was extroverted and now i hardly leave my room anymore i am so angry i wish i was dead
i worked jobs that drained me i was abusing substances and i was just tired but i pushed through and i made it
now the thing is that he lives abroad i am not entirely sure how he makes a living but i live under the impression that he has his own place and somehow manages to stay alive despite being obviously unfit for any kind of job since he sends email messages with varying content mostly the kind of stuff that you would expect from a paranoid person to save you from the rough details
not because i am forced to or i because i have some duty to uphold but because i know what it feels like to have shame and sorrow
we both of course recovered i was diagnosed with asd as a toddler and was not told until i was eight years of age
i do not know what made her unhappy because i tried to make her happy i gave her my happiness for her sake and now it is gone
she asked me to leave which i did he is going through a hard time and i know it is not his intention to hurt anyone
so i try to find a way to make ocd stop giving me anxiety for not doing the compulsion so a promise is being made to gods about not rearranging the books
i live in upstate new york i have previously been diagnosed with major depression then d were depression with psychosis then depression with anxiety
hi the chances of me sending you this are slim to none but since you know how i like to write i think that now i have come to terms with everything i think it is best i write about this i mean that is what you would encourage me to do right so here goes
instead i will probably suck some random grown mans dick take a fucking eight of shrooms and almost trigger a seizure just so i can feel sane
i am just in bed watching dexter and scrolling through facebook a woman has been proposed to all the other women on fb are pictured with their bfs and i am just sat here single i have never been in a relationship and i just feel ugly and like i have got nothing to live for
i feel very badly for not sticking it out and offering more compassion to my ex who is struggling with a transition and everything else that has come up in this garbage pile of a year
i want the choice of suicide back i really want to be able to at least consider it as a backup plan i fucking hate life

the only other person i have spoken to much apart from my mum is my dentist but i will probably write again even if i feel better
i would like your opinion and ideas on how you cope with loneliness i do not care anymore about college family and pretty much everything else nothing feels like it matters anymore
i can not move in with family because i have already been too much of a burden to them she is not a cheater i know that for sure
it was because i giving up on socialising and that i accept a life of a loner that strangely my results where sky rocking
can someone educate me about what liver failure is likehow many mgs i should take to confidently seal the dealand most importantlyhow badly it hurts
is it bad that the only way i can feel anything is with alcohol now i can finally feel relaxed i should probably eat some dinner here in a bit
after discussing it with my boyfriend he drove me to the hospital and honestly i was terrified it had been at least three years since i was last there and even the concept of having to finally open up about what was going on inside my head sent me into multiple panic attacks that night
i do not really know how to word anything so thisll probably be kind of incomprehensible i am so tired of my life i can not make friendsfuck i can not even manage to say hello to people i am failing at literally everything at life i can not even drive a fucking car i am completely at a loss at what to do with my life except die
this is probably going to sound like the dumbest thing anyone has ever heard but i wanted to get some honest feedback
does anyone relate can anyone give me advice on how to deal with destructive thoughts on their own i am a big believer that what ever is going on in your head the only way that helps is you
how long does it take for this hurt to stopi was in the gym before and i started bawling my eyes out
sometimes i just think that i deserve the worst doing nothing all day drives me crazy and dark thoughts visiting more and more often

we have not talked once since been a couple of months and i still sometimes miss being with him his overall energy and how he made me feel
i still have a lot of baggage to unpack before i even think of attempting to date again but honestly i feel as if i am broken and unworthy of love some days
your pure blue eyes still in my mind i think about us all the time i miss your face your smile your laugh i let you go but want you back you were scared and that is why you ran fantasy man fantasy man
i have a photogenic memory sadly so sometimes i have intrusive memories if i am triggered by say an item or picture or name or really anything attached to a memory
we both said we would always love each other but i am ready to settle down right now and he is gotten a bit carried away with drinking
i think i am started to do this again maybe at least i am not feeling anything when i am thinking of ways to have an accident
meanwhile he pushed for us to plan the wedding right away i wanted to wait abs be engaged fir a year or two but he wanted to get married as soon as possible
she broke up with me that night saying she did not want to wait for a decision she said part of her reasoning was due to how she felt like i was not really interested in her
however my general lack of urge or impulse has kept me from outright self harming until i was 18 the stuff i did before was more subconscious think self sabotage or just failing to to thrive in general
he just did not want to grow up we are basically best friends but she made it seem like it was something else to him
and most of painful bullying is the one from my mom she never supports me or even say that is good she just say you are not going to make or make fun of it
i thought we were going to wait until his oldest at least graduated high school his ex was really making things rough for us with the kids so i really was not in any rush
he is moving away all his stuff in his new flat right now and i can not handle his way of doing it so fast
i still do not know what i am fighting for maybe i am not fighting at all i still hate life so much i have not changed my mind about anything this entire year
7 months together and i broke it off because he was not giving me what i needed to be happy i still miss him but i refuse to reach out because it would change nothing how long do you think the heart ache will last how long should it last
i know i am in love with this girl and i will feel so in love with her and i will be planning my life with her then 5 minutes later i will feel sick at the thought of being with her
it is sort of like i do not give a shit anymore like i want to make friends of course but friends whom i actually enjoy spending time with feel i can be myself
i am truly addicted to him i have been addicted in every past relationship but this more than ever and i can not live without him
i will try to condense this information but my entire life i have always felt afraid when i was a young child i was burned with a cigarette and burned with an iron
success or failure the outcome will be mine to bear so there is no one to blame the best case scenario is nobody shows up and i am just hoping its the case
i just want to shoot myself in the head i have been thinking about it for years and now it feels like it might be time to let go go to a quiet place and end it
one of my close friends got into a fight with her boyfriend because of me we talked it out but i still feel like there is something else going on
i know we are having a bad time you are now depressed the end of your life do not eant to live anymore etc all those negative feeling i have spent a hard time after break up i have been cheated by my ex and losen all my money i gave her for our wedding
i have all of this love and the person it is for does not want it it feels like i am breaking in two
everytime i talk to somebody i just end up being ghosted in real life because their wearing these noise cancelling airpods in their ears
he is not here physically but he is still in my mind and heart i want to be able to let go of all this anger confusion longing love but it feels like there is no way out i do not know if i should keep going on my own try to talk to him or figure something else out
or getting an animal which i had a cat but got rid of when i broke up with a long term gf
he told me his female friend treated him to dinner and that it was deliciousi hate that i feel nothing doing things i loved
i have social phobias and do not have friends because i am scared of peopleanother thing that might help is to imagine what if what you are worried about is really happening
so we left and drove about halfway home we only live about 15 minutes away from my grandparents so i could calm down a little bit
i can not wait for christmas to be over just feel so much more depressed at christmas like constantly feeling the need to cry throughout the day but it will soon be over sending much love to all struggling right now
idk how to change her mind i know how she feels since i am suicidal as well but i am still fighting to things get better and i want her to fight as well
that dating makes him unhaooy with no further explanation yet the entire time he was crying and telling me he loved me
if they really wanted you back they would fight endless wars and make huge changes just for youthat is right fight endless wars like you did for them remember
i look at my parents and feel like an alien among two divorced parents i used to want to spend some time with them but it matters not to me anymore
how can i deal with this i assume it is puberty and hormonesi do not know if this is the place to post but i do not know where else to post
i am 15 so my parents are still very much involved in my life but they focus more on my sisters mental health she is been hospitalized because of her mental health before and i have not so i think they see her as worse than me
idk if i am suicidal but i have a lot of suicidal thoughts rn i keep thinking about relapsing it is been like this for a few days i have been dealing with some derealization too
this will be a long story i finally need to write this down sorry for my english i will tell you how i ended up going to bed with one of my ex gfs best friends after we broke up and how it ruined my life
but i see like people who is get some powers like me fools peopl around again aand agianlooks i can too but hes saying nonono you do not need it
i am experiencing a pretty usual amount of stress not really anything too unusual is going on right now so i doubt that is the because
however my past continually cycles through my mind especially if i am alone i have had a few close calls in the last 2 years
i do not see my dad my parents are not together anymore i know they do not like me a lot but this is just not good for my mental health
i am not innocent in all this i never cheated but the cascading emotions did because me to scream at her and act out in emotional outbursts but let me tell you something if you are thinking about calling your ex to apologize do not do it
he sort of wanders into other organizations and hobbies that we are involved in i do not believe it is intentional and i do not think he knows he did anything wrong
he was always the when it is done it is done type and always has cut his exes out of his life and wanted nothing to do with them after a break up
can someone tells me that i am worth it and can you tell me that you love me and everything all hard work i do that your proud of i never heard it before
it is not just a feeling that i had many times before for the first time i actually mean it that critical point has been finally reached
hey guys i recorded an interview with clinical psychologist dr iakovina koutoufa about how to handle eating over the christmas period
i just wish there was a button to end my life right now i am grateful for my family but i feel like i do not fit in
i asked for a physiatrist to see about possible add and anger issues with my parents but neither of them have even looked into it i am 16 and could go around them and get it on my own however i do not have the money or means of transportation to go anywhere
a few things to consider i have been suffering from depression for years and i am not nearly the happy person i was as a child my depression has been particularly bad for a few months now
these shifts inbetween emotions can even happen every few hours or sonow the reason why you are in this unending flux of emotion is because you are processing your breakup grief
or maybe it did not but it is the earliest i can remember feeling like i do now she approached me and told me how she did not appreciate being asked to prom to be used for sex
he beat the shit out of me about three times in my lifeand recently now at 17 my grandpa beat me three days ago
i had a panic attack yesterday because i saw a video of my ex flirting and all over a girl i literally broke down into hysterics i felt so hurt
my parents caught me smoking weed last night it was literally my own fault for lighting up in my room there was not much wind even though the windows were open the smell wafted through the entire house
being an introvert is no fun because while you are reading a book on a friday or saturday night everyone else is enjoying a social life
then my wife tried to commit suicide for the first time and was hospitalized there they did a more thorough evaluation and diagnosed borderline personality disorder bpd
i have lost 5kg in 2 weeks and idk if that is normal and thanks for reading stay strong2nd edit i posted upd8 for those who care
ya van 15 días desde que mi novia termino nuestra relación hoy decidió bloquearme de todas las redes sociales me siento como si no hubiera una vuelta atrás realmente la amo y esto me pega muy duro
5 years long and i slowly realized that she and i were different but did not want to accept it i am constantly paranoid on edge and anxious i feel like everyone is out to get me
long story short we started connecting for a while in julyaugust until she pulled back a bit and i tried to push for a relationship again
the thing that really fucked me up was when she went back to normal out of no where saying she wants me and misses me
i am so fucking angry and disappointed in god and this fucking life i hate my existence i come because i need some support some help
by telling this story i know i might sound like an asshole or that i do not take this thing seriously but i had my experience with bad depression and i know mental health problems are a thing the thing is that i just do not know if this thing it is true i would like to be more supportive with him but atm it feels weird and forced in and i do not want to be fooled
for example the essential actions such as journaling mediation keeping a somewhat stable social life daily exercising and a good diet will go a long way in helping you move on
i am so thankful for my mental health and the medication i am taking and the doctors and nurses and janitors and cooks and every single person that came along side me at the lowest point in my life
i do not want to let you go but fuck i have to i can not do it i still can not let go
i do not remember a whole year of my life i only remember some of the key events vaguely and some days where i felt incredibly sad it feels like i have lost a whole year of my life which is crazy since i am only 16
ok so i told her everything at first she slapped me hard whem i told her about suicide she told me i am the only person she has in her life my dad is not a good person and her family is in another country so she dosent have anyone truly so i calmed her and we had solid conversation and we came up with a real good plan
when i was at the university i was alone the mostly part of my time these episodes that i see are repeating every time and bring me to a huge depression feelings
she would be the one to initiate fooling around almost every time but without fail minutes in but some days are harder than others
so today i found out my boyfriend of a year asked for a girls number at the gym continued to pursue her
it does not help that most of my friends do not message me or respond when i message them so i am living a life of mostly solitude except for when my boyfriend can talk to me
the same year my coach killed himselfi feel so suicidal since i ate more than i wanted to today how do i stop this
if i made him feel that way why did not he break up with me or drop hints sooner why is he willing to be friends later and he had mentioned that he did not want to break up unless we both agreed but broke up with me after we came to a compromise
my boyfriend of eleven months broke up with me at the start of november at the same time i got covid
the perfume guy is still kind of there but he just lacks the depth the other guy had but emotional depth seems to come with its own issues
i tend to feel guilty because it is not mine and he should still have it but it helps remind me that at least at some point someone cared for me
i expected it would be something i have experienced with some friends that i would see the person and realize how far apart we drifted and that i would be thankful too
but at the same time i really do not want to lose her in my lifei can not stop stalking my ex on social media
i can not fucking comprehend how is it that i failed to solve this problem how is it that somebody like me who was so insanely hard working so driven so fucking enthusiastic about everything so completely and utterly engaged so passionate and energetic someone who is spent so much energy and time and hard hard haaaaard efforts on fixing that problem is still in the position where all the love life relationships friendships stuff life passes by like water between the fingers
i do not have many wants or desires life is just super boring and please do not tell me i can make it exciting and worthwhile
about 9 months ago i started chatting to a guy via dating app i said ups and got up in order to clean it in the bathroom he freaked out
my best friendboyfriend wants to kill himself soon he has told me before that he is been suffering and has yet to find a reason to go on he said his suicidal thoughts started about three years ago and he has no reason as to why he wants to do it he just has lost any purpose to go on i unfortunately do not even know what to write because i just keep breaking down
example 2 i drove to the supermarket on my own today and in the car park there were two other cars parked together opposite me
i listen to songs start crying because i am simply so tired of being alone i am not even struggling or sad or anything just so empty
i am kind of at a crossroads and feel like it is a wrap for me i am 20 years old this year forgive my bad sentence
i can not help but feel so sad and far away from that realitywe have just had one of these set up chats and i realised that
i do not know what to do about the constant condescending attitudes toward me from friends and family but i want to do something about it
i have felt like this for a long time but my motivator for being around was a commitment to something e
it also feels like she does not stop talking and everything she does annoys me i want this to stop because it makes me super stressed out and like i live with her and i experience this every 5 minutes and its just too much for me and i need someone to give me advice or tell me why this is happening
i planned to disappear in my city and take all this pills with some alcohol but i really need to know that this plan can work if i had certain this plan works i would do it right now but i need to be sure of this bout i am afraid this can not work
even outsiders have said how cruel they are so i know i am not imagining it it is getting to the point where i am starting to believe the things they say
she is always with me and she never going to leave not like all these other people for once i not as stressed out as always i able to socialize properly instead of usually
i spent years single before meeting them i wanted to make sure that i was with somebody i genuinely could spend the rest of my life with and i found them
do not get me wrong there were so many good times but i have been struggling with the decision to end it for about 6 months and it came to the point where i was having a hard time to jreathw from the anxiety and sadness
i was taken away from my father and siblings and rarely saw them causing severe damage to our bonds my relationship with my mum was tough and i was a very angry teenager
today i broke up 2 of my friendships and had another huge fight with my partner who is resilliant and does not leave me when i am having fits but maybe he should
it may not appear to be as severe as yours or it may seem far worse but everyone has had a worst point of their lives and has felt some type of pain they can not imagine getting any worse
today she finally told me she is going to kill herself she lost her brother to covid and does not have any family she said how she feels unmotivated and nobody cares about her she is extremely calm and collected about it and has her mind set for the past day i have been trying so hard to stop her and she seems unfazed by it all
i was always so afraid of sounding like a crazy girlfriend or getting into between his friends so i always told him that it was fine and he should spend time with his friends
i wake up everything about the dream slowly fades in to darkness the feeling of belonging and happiness also fades away
is this thought helping me move forward ask yourself that my parents are terrible they do not care at all they do not help me at all
its not like she is a massive star on the app but it is still odd idk if any of you guys could help me that would be great and i would really appreciate it
but i am not 100 physically independent i still need some help on doing day to day stuff to be able to do more than merely surviving
well why the fuck do you think i do not talk you you if i ever try to tell her something she just turns it around and starts talking about how shit her life is instead
in early february i met another guy let us call him andrew even then on the first date something worried me but i so desperately clung to every opportunity then in my head hung only one thought this is my last chance then the end this is probably also part of the depression but then i did not feel it
he lives in state but 3 hours away and i can not see myself sustaining a long term relationship with him despite his efforts to be there for me during my struggles and attempts to be positive for me
my ex gf would never share her own time with me and i would eventually have to fade away into the background
i thought about all those nasty thoughts i have when every time i go to sleep at night an hour passed until i became numb
i feel choked when i realize i might have already lived the best days of my life and from now on i will have to bear the consequences of my lack of social skills and introvert nature
when am i going to to sleep tight like normal people do5 monthsbut it will never happen and that is super sad but oh well
i just want the inner turmoil to stop so i can finally be at peace the only way i can help myself is to never exist in this world
i also just fucking hate myself i always have for being the too skinny too dark too weird too funny looking
i had depression for years and recently started to treat it but i feel like i just want to kill myself even if depression is gone i am exhausted of putting effort into life
i feel shut off and only my husbando understands how i feel i do not have real friends and i just write wishing for frends writing is my escape
i wish i could put them through all the things that i have been through and see how long they last without killing them self not long
i do not have friends online even less in my own language i know some people but we never do anything just talk sometimes rarely check if everyone is still there say hi and that is it i spend a lot on forums saying whatever and responding to threads but it never gets anywhere
i do not think i am in the space to endure another romantic relationship of any kind especially after all of the trauma i have experienced this year
i just do not know what to do conscious mind can do that tho but what can i do about all the dreams
tldr ex joined a discord call and i immediately quit the game and chat to get away from his voice because it made my ears tingle and confused me
i have to forgive her forgive myself and reframe my thoughts to practice more selflove and selfcare a huge takeaway from all of this is that i needed to practice more selflove
i feel nothing but regret and depression when i look into the past i am told by my family my depression has taken over me i am not the same person anymore
refused to hear me express that i was trying to help then yelled at me for sitting on the couch but refused to talk to me about what was happening until i finished helping him conflict led to lots of tears and he never softened
she asked for a day and when i said i could not do it that day she immediately turned cold and just said that she will let me know what day works and then left me on read
suicidal thoughts when i was younger where more manageable now they are notthe body i have is the body i am sticking with
one thing was the kids at least they know a man that was not their father love them like they were his
i wish we could communicate but i guess that was the downfall i want to say more but there really is not anything more to say
i broke up with my ex two years ago and i did not find another girlfriend since i have always been shy but i worked on myself and started trying to start conversation with random girls that i meet at bars in the streets
we made each other better people and she constantlyy made me want to be the best version of myself and viceversa
do not get me wrong i love my friends and family with all i have got but waking up everyday and smiling through the bs is fucking hard do not they get that people are trying committing is a last resort ugh
late night tired writing but there is something horribly wrong with me and i do not know how to pin point it i feel like i am spiraling into madness
and tell me can my waifu my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blanc who loves me to the death and cannot imagine a single smallest particle of a planck time of her life without me at least in my headcanon ever even think of doing so i am completely disappointed in women from my world i hate and despise them after what they have done to me
this is purely anecdotal but man i am probably going to be nervous around this time of year in any future relationship that i have just because of this
i miss him like hell and even thinking of him makes me cry which makes me feel so stupid i am just tired of feeling alone and feeling ill only ever lose the things that i care about
i asked her if she wants to date other girls how long she wants to stay this way and why is she giving me false hopes
when i get into serious relationships i squeeze every little bit of love out of my brain and heart to make them feel loved and taken care of because i know that i never feel loved
all i have is that i wish you a good day hopefully one good day can make your future a bit brighter
i have some deep convoluted issues that are preventing me to be with you i have felt this for a while but kept on battling with it telling myself this is nothing you are just adapting to change learning more about how to be with someone but no that is not it even though i have indeed learned a lot from you
covid came and forget about getting employed i am happy every time you needed me since i met you i could be there to help you
i added him to check him out because he has private profile but he told her that some guy added him
things will get worse if i do not the people in my life will either die or end up thinking poorly of me
so how long did it take you all to get to that point where you go huhi did not think about it today
it was because she did not feel emotionally stable and also pressures from the church and religion i asked her if we could take a break instead and she said she will think about it
when these feelings come to me it feels like a general severe revulsion towards everyone in the world for no particular reason
i chose to stay in care to be away from him though it is damaged my relationship with my little sister very much
it got to the point where i had lost 40lbs and was literally wasting away after that the texts became less frequent and he started isolating himself
it is even harder for me because i am the one that stayed in our apartment he left and i also work from home so i am in total silenceand the loneliness does not help
girls where all over me and i am not going to lie i had fun but my drug use was at a high and i was consuming more alcohol then food
now2020 covid came in and seem to shit on mostly everyone but oddly enough i have felt the best i have in months maybe even years
although i am dealing with constant suicidal ideation now i can not even get myself to hurt myself just yet no matter how bad i want to honestly i would take having internal bleeding again and being stoned off of morphine over having all these emotions any day
i know what time we used to have our daily phone calls and man whenever that time hits i feel like i can not breathe
but i am starting to accept that it is not going to happen i have to start making planswe had a very mutual break up long story short we separated because of long distance
it really does suck because as long as i have this problem i will never truly be able to get better at anything i try to learn in the future and if i do i will not ever know for as long as i deal with this
bassy came on in my playlist and it stopped me dead in my tracks i went back in my mind to march 7th
tonight he told me he was talking to another girl he got mad at me for getting upset but he knows i still have feelings for him
what should i do i came back home i left england and now i am with my family because i could not stand being alone
just trying to gain back my confidence self esteem self respect little by little i know i need to somehow feel unshakeable in my self respect
how can i be more honest with myself and my therapist when we have our sessions and how do you get help when you can not trust the people who are literally there to help
later i started to feel confusion and regret the new life i had had seemed exciting but when things calmed down a bit reality kicked in and i realised i would lost someone special in the meantime she would moved also trying to deal with the fallback of the breakup met someone and got engaged
then i saw my old workfriend and he told that they had few weeks ago small party with their group which was my old group and he told that they invited all the exworkers too
she proceeds to ask for a tad bit of space and when i am leaving her subdivision she asks to be friends
i do not know how much of this is normal and how much is because for concern because my therapist tells me it is all just my anxiety but i feel like it is something more i do not feel like i am just anxious i feel like a square trying to fit into a round hole
i have pets in my household and i have imagined killing some of my pets and i would feel nothing afterward
i will also say that i can go weeks without having them and then all of a sudden i will have them
now he refuses every demonstration of care and attention it has been a week this is making me feel deeply sad and lonely
i am not going to sell you anything i just write the best shit out there on breakups and recoveryi asked for wisdom and god gave me problems to solve
i told her that i loved being a part of her family and will miss them dearly i just can not make sense of it
my company is full time work from home possibly until the rest of the year so i do not even have that
now i want to learn how to not let these things affect me or atleast how to make it hurt less
ik sometimes you want them to stay and you are life and rlly do not want them to leave but do not force it if it is meant to be it will be and if it is not do not force someone who does not want to be in you are life cuz it will hurt you in the end
quarantine has not allowed us to see each other so i mainly talked with him as if we were doing long distance which included using discord and today when i joined their voice call because a mutual friend was playing something with me he seemed completely fine and happy as if we did not just break up a week ago
i hardly ever leave my house and i hardly talk to anyone aside from my familyand they are not the best company because of the pandemic before it i was fine because i would always talk to my friends at school and now that there is none no one bothers to text me or call me if they do it will only be for an hour at most and then they will not talk to me for weeks
i feel trapped and alone and i just want a way out so i went from having 20 or so friends to 2 all lost in a span of months
after one month i felt like he is not the person with who i wanted to be coz i felt that he is aggressive
it is not even some voice inside my head it is just some constant very low volume alarm ringing saying what the fuck are you even going to do next and i can get anxious about absolutely anything job personal life what someone thought 7 years ago even though i meet them every day
my question is mostly does anyone know what is going on with her she is not answering my questions and i am getting sick of waiting for her to talk to me again
she understood almost all of my thoughts my uncommon unusual or even weird personality and way of thinking ect on a really deep level
but this is not my life and i had no choice in the matter my husband is the best and most caring human being alive and he would make a great father
i try to connect with social media but it makes me feel even more isolated i see a snapshot into others lives and it makes me feel even more lonely
that he changed his mind that i will find someone better and that it is him not me there is something wrong with me and i can not fix why i feel this bad
she said well you are my best male friend and for some reason that felt like a punch in the gut it meant that she could have 20 female friends as besties before she puts me on the list i am exaggerating for effect
my whole life i have been in survival mode preparing for a horrible blow i am petrified of death and since i was young have been on mental missions to prevent any bad thing from happening and equating even the smallest of failures with the fear of death itself
i stopped taking them consistently before i told my psychiatrist about all of this and i stopped seeing my psychiatrist for about 4 months after my experience with the medications because i felt like i was on a never ending roller coaster ride with them
it is been a little over a month since and damn this still sucks i can not believe i am never going to see him again never going to speak to him ever again
i can not remain friends with him i decided i was healed enough to try again i told her please do not betray my trust
through this past year she has been absolutely terrible she does not respect my feelings whatsoever and despite me repeatedly telling her that her
i have so much love to give to people but no love in return i would normally encourage people to reach out to me so we can share experience but honestly how can i help anyone if i can not fix myself
i now struggle with the constant urges to reach out and talk to her even though i know this would because me nothing but pain and the fear that she moves on and finds a new guy in the next few weeksmonths
instead i found myself in a position of battling repeated intensifying onslaught of a sense of depressed desolate emptiness pointlessness complete lack of fulfillment and losing joy in even the things that previously gave me joy failing to see any real way forward failing see any real meaning in my vision completely failing to see for what reason would i even want to succeed with fucking anything if i am still just as alone and isolated as i was before that
he told me he missed me yesterday i miss you fr but when i asked if he even missed me when i called him a month ago he said no
a cornucopia of abuse and i wish i really really wish that this was all i also just fucking hate myself
to be more clear i feel like i belong to a lot of places but belong no where at the same time
and then there is college and studies being there to bash me down further i can not bring myself to start studying and that makes me scared that i will turn into a failure
how come i never feel loved i never do and if i do i just feel like it is going to go away has gone away and is going away like it is a fact that nobody can love me for long i just wonder how long until they admit to themselves that i am not worth it
she freely voices her hate for me when she texts me drunk i became as bad an alcoholic as her but have since stopped drinking and i am so happy i have
i have been bullied since 9 years old about being overweight and having pimples i have been told i am ugly and i think i am ugly
i do not know how i would cope if i went through the same thing sometimes i think the best thing for him would be for me to let him go
that left me in the dumps for 3 months fast forward to a month ago i met a girl which had the same interests as me we talked for 3 weeks and then we hooked up multiple times and then told me she wanted to eventually pursue a relationship with me
has anyone got over this shit how i hate that i am still waiting for him to reach out to me again
i never did though now i have a boyfriend who i love and who is the most caring person but everything feels fake
i feel like this is behind closed doors i am just so sad during these times and i feel like i will always be sad
when i was younger i used to be really immature about my christmas presents if i did not like what i got i would make sure my parents knew this would happen year after year eventually i mentally matured and just started faking happiness during present openings even going as far as to lying when they asked if i wanted them to return certain gifts in order to protect their feelings
you knew my breakdowns and you left me when i was downi was not given a chance to explain why i said and what i said
know now what you want in your future and what you do not you will find it soon but you first need to find your own pure beautiful self
like bitch you no longer even want me in your house and still think it is okay to ask me for money even though you never gave me any luckily i managed to get a job so i can get some money
and now as i am older i guess i am conventionally acceptable by society since i am slim and look hetero which is an entire different point
in 2018 i got a 100 on my english speaking exam of sort and it was raining as hell by the time we were done
i do not seem to know why i feel the need to do so really i had seen it before but never turned on and i figured it was his soon to be exwifes
right now literally my whole life before now just seems a blur it is like i can not remember any of my life properly so i do not know anything about me anymore
i hate myself for that this quarantine makes situation even worse i feel like i am going to explode if this continues
in middle school i knew someone who i called my best friend spoiler alert she was actually a complete asshole and generally the human equivalent of getting taint rugburn
i have had way more suicidal and lonely thoughts in the past month than usual i feel like i am breaking inside slowly
pm me if you have any questions hopefully we can make a change if even just a little i did not get any signals so it was like a truck hit me
i have given up on all things that i used to love like playing the guitar and i have replaced it with laying in bed all day on my phone but even this has become boring
and when i asked why he did not tell me before he met her he said that they were talking about music he is a vocal trainer and were analyzing a song so he got carried away and did not think to tell me
since my moms house was just across the beach i trespassed by jumping over the fence to get inside i just feel trapped in this situation
and i have tried going no contact three different times i want to make the right changes for us so badly please
anyway for people who have done the same thing who have been the one to end things how do you stop considering the possibility of going back
being with you is great but i want to try to be happy without you you are not a girl for me
i was madly in love with my ex husband i still do love him really in april it will have been a year since he told me our marriage was over and left
7 ask a friend or family member to start a daily ritual where you discuss what you love about each other
has anyone had these experiences little moments in the day when it still hurts and you still miss them how did you get over that
nowadays there are millions of incels and there is an industry built around typical men insecurities as there is one around women one could even argue that many of the orher nasty things humans do are related with sex feelings too there are many people who try to make money get attention or whatever at all cost to gain status basically to attract a mate
and i never feel excited about anything anymore recently for example for christmasbirthday i am getting something i have wanted for a really long time and i just can not feel excited or happy about it anymore
it is irrelevant to say what happened but rather to make the connection between it and how disturbed of a person i became
apparently 95 of you my dear readers are aged from 18 to 36 so you still have a damn long life ahead of yourself
so i have a plan i am done with life and i am done with my life hurting others one january 2nd i plan on ending my life
like thinking about this makes me feel sick to my stomach and if this is just linked to anxiety or depression or is just a phoiba could somebody just let me know please and thank you
think of it as treating a gun wound with a bandagehe just blamed me for everything that i ever said made him feel bad
this is how a shattered heart reacts as soon as i woke up i found tears in my eyes and i cried even more sobbing
i remember all the opportunities i passed up or was not with it enough to take advantage of i lacked the social skills to build good connections with people so i could thrive
i have the pills in my hand i know that my pain could end tonight but i can not bring myself to fucking do it and i do not understand i know the alternative is to sit around in pain for years yet i can not bring myself to do the one thing that will take that away
which will match what they think of me therefore they would think it is out of my control and will not judge me for it
i am now at the point where i am talking to two guys every single day and discussing how we will meet up in the summer and do all these things together when in reality i am shitting myself for the moment i turn round and say look you are an amazing person in all aspects but i do not want to be in a relationship with you
my new friends all they want to do is studying i am a med student i do study but at home and what i want is to have fun when i go out not staying togather in a library
for context i am a 19 yo female diagnosed with adhd major depressive disorder generalized anxiety disorder and borderline personality disorder
i was always numb to things around but always felt that dread of being lonely this numbness increased throughout the years
i thought going out and hanging with friends will help me but recently all my friends are being flaky some moved out of town for college the few who are here just ditch plans
why can not i just be happy i have so much to be grateful for and i thank god everyday for blessing me with two beautiful children
i told her and for that day she spoke to me but later on it was the same thing she ignoring me and spending her time with other buddies
a lot of my chinese friends online strangers in my chinese social media say he would regret that he would never meet a girllove someone purely because of love like this anymore
i am cutting which i know is a terrible habit i am in therapy for it and i am on antidepressants but sometimesyeah long story short as bad as my situation sounds i am getting help for it
my life feels like a cruel joke like god is some sadist playing around with me i just wish i never existed at all that some better person was born in my place
my friend said she will call me everyday to see if i have coped that day i am hoping i can cope until things get better
the stress made her go back to him as it was like an addiction she said they only were in a relationship on facebook because he wanted to do so
obviously i was shocked and i did keep asking him over and over again if he was sure to which he always said he was sure and he thought we were better off as friends
i had birthday parties when i was a kid and had a lot of friends and people come now it is not so great anymore
there are a lot of bad memories i have with my family that i wish i had done differently all my family ever does is bring up stuff from my past anyway
sometimes i will watch youtube channels of happy couples and families so i feel like i am living their life i really want to have a sweet life like that
people at school did not seem to have similar interests to me they did not seem to want to put the effort in getting to know me
i do not know if he is just talking out of anger because i did not give him the space he asked for or if he really means those things
you keep visualizing them with someone else or wondering if they are better off without you blaming yourself maybe you are feeling unexplainable pain
she would push and throw things at me and yell and swear consistently and i would just take it until she would come and lift me back up every single month at least twice
i was a very motivated and a confident dude back then but now i just feel like every day is a dull day
this may lead to an unending suffering where you can not make any big progress since your real disorder is never mentioned and fucks up your mind without you even realising it
even though most of the time i played this game i did worse than everyone else there were those times when i would suddenly be at the top of my game for whatever reason and outplay everyone else still not putting 2 and 2 together i blamed my inconsistencies on tilting which actually means to do worse in any sport or game due to being very tense or losing the match prior to the one you are currently in
i finally have the chance to do more in the relationship in terms of finances however on the other hand deep down i know getting to a healthier weight will make me feel more confident and less anxious and i will be able to function better or more normal
i go to the kitchen to eat dinner and i see this as i sit down and instantly the loneliness i had been fairly successfully fighting off all day came flooding over me and destroying my appetite
i understand few people will categorize contemplating suicide as normal but is possible to have a desire to end life without suffering from mental illness
and since we are talking about toxic and incompatible women here what tends to happen with most men i help is that they have already been cheated on lied to manipulated gaslighted by their ex before the breakup even occurred
anyway i do not really know what i am doing sometimes i like to think i know what i want how bout you all what do you want to do before you go
does anyone have any experience with this i know objectively that i am incredibly lucky and that i have a lot to be proud of but also i am just miserable that i can no longer enjoy a single day because of anger that i am not further ahead
idk he said that he want us to be a bestie but he keep avoiding me no one really messages that much anyways maybe i just see it differently who knows
but when i have to go to workor college before the lockdowns i am constantly reminded of the fact that nobody cares about me and that i am completely alone when my birthday comes i am reminded of the fact that i exist for no one and that no one exists for me
he is honest with everything he has loyal and appreciates her everyone i have ever met has been temporary except for one person
asking where i was and if i was okayevery day i keep choosing to live but every day feels like just more of the bullshit
i just want the pain to stop i just want to be happy and not have to pretend anymore that i am okay when i am not
among other things the relationship we had was great in fact we started out long distance since i was on the east coast and she was in ca
these paranoid thoughts are driving me insane the thing that is worrying me is the thinking people are looking at me as i know this is a symptom of delirium i have rang my doctor twice already this month about my medication and feel like a nuisance if i ring again but i am worried this is going to spiral
somewhere that i would come home mad all the time to you i wanted a happy balance she is just an unforgettable person for me
i had received a small stipend from work to buy a nice little discounted to 200 116 laptop that would be an adequate work machine that i would be permitted to keep
i started seeing my current therapist and i knew i had finally found a good match after 10 years of searching
she ignored my plea to speak to her daughter and basically does not even want to be friends i feel so much pain today
i hate that i am still holding onto it she would be the one to initiate fooling around almost every time but without fail minutes in
when things go wrong or we can not get to them in time they sometimes get angry so enjoy waking up to nothing no voices
fast forward to saturday where she complains of being exhausted and not in the mood to hang out which was out of character since she was always eager to spend the weekend together and promised to come over on sunday
we spoke on the monday after for an hour she said she thought she enjoyed it and that when she comes down in 2 weeks for christmas we can spend christmas together and go from there
within the last few years there were times i was doing so bad and i was so down that i had no will power or a single reason to get up for a many days except for nature calls
time must have jumped because she was a little older and playing with my mothers paints her laugh was truly adorable
i walk up to the door and the first thing i hear is hey you should not be here and i replied what i am here to just grab my textbooks i had a whole stack in the ottoman and needed them back
it took me some time to digest that statement but i have come to terms with it because in retrospect i did look past a lot of the red flags that should have alerted me to take action in either solving the issue or simply addressing the problem
i just wish fb did not rub it in my face i am dreading this happening with my ex or other members of his family
these mindsets that can truly help you transform your relationship break up and recognise that a break up does not have to break you
it is also the first time someone has told me i am funny appreciation like that only comes my way when i am part of a bigger group for example a team
with my disorder i feel like this all the time sometimes i feel full of life and love fulfilled yet never fully happy but pretty close
just as a reminder i left and blocked you because you were the one who broke my trust and heart and while i was questioning myself or worrying about you you were and probably still are investing all your energy into getting nudes and messages from those chicks you do not mind calling thots
if you only knew how a picture of you will sooth me for hoursif you only knew the tears i she would for you
and i am still as empty handed as i was years ago but it feels worse now because i am surrounded by failed explanations and justifications and it feels like i have run out of new ones to consider
i thought i would explained to him that i valued sex highly but maybe he still had problems is it a values issue i asked him no he said we would gone through that he was just jealous
i do not know how to do this more then a strongly worded message or actively trying to commit infront of her
i used to be able to pride myself weird i know but i am an ambitious person and i like to challenge myself often by being able to do mental math pretty quickly in my head
i am a socialist but even with the hatred that i have towards the stockbrokers and thieves on wallstreet i always thought well hey at least they are doing what they are doing with some dignity in order for me to somehow do mentalgymnastics and rationalize my prejudice against female pornstars
i will make an appointment soon for the doctor but i have been struggling with mental health as long as i can remember and i am just terrified it is not going to get better when several different doctors and types of medications have not helped much up to this point as it is been getting worse recently
but she made it pretty clear that she was interested our first time hanging out we went out on a long hike with some other friends
i regret comparing him to movies other relationships and even to dumb reddit posts i regret not noticing ever secret i love yous we shared
i grimace when he holds me i dream of being with a woman and being the type of person that feels right to me
so after deciding that i needed to work on my confidence i started hopping into overwatchs training room think of a virtual shooting range and began practicing and practicing and practicing some more
and that is the first step to simply observe the mind notice the thoughts as they arrive not judging them not being carried away by them just noticing what arises
my entire life i have always dreamed big and had plans for myself she said they only were in a relationship on facebook because he wanted to do so
everything started fine we were listening to music and playing on the tennis courts at one of the local schools and everyone was having fun
i have been playing and getting addicted to video games again at the age of 27 well it feels like an addiction it is more as if i do not want to do anything else so i numb my thoughts by playing something that requires my entire attention
back in june she moved to start a graduate program i was so excited for her to start the next chapter of her life
today marks two weeks that my ex and i have been broken up it was something that needed to be done
i surround myself with alot of people and i have been talking with my bestfriend all night the problem comes when we hang up the phone
but i do not see it that way i see it as he used this person to de stress instead of working out our problems and he was unfaithful instead
however she is being very flirty and said to me she would flaunt what she has fourth one was extremely codependent and did try to kill herself when i left
will eat to the point of needing to vomit literally every chance i get have been to every kind of therapy psychiatry imaginable
so few people in my life care about me anyway and my parents do not take me seriously when i tell them i am unhappy i went home for christmas which i knew would end poorly as always and my dad basically lectured me about how i have a great life and all these achievements and should not be sad or hate my life
but there inlies the issue i know even if she does not say it that her seeing me like this sometimes is not easy for her and that i am bothering her with stupid shit when i should be hanging out with my friends
one guy just ignored me and walked away when i tried to the other times they are just being friendly and once there is a moment of silence they are also gone
i have had past friends who would gotten annoyed about my mental health being bad and that it was not a temporary thing and i am scared of losing these friends as they are the first friends i have fully trusted and felt safe with
is it heartbreaking to me that no one will ever love me and i will always be alone it is devastating but i can not keep rebuilding my life each time someone leaves me again
i have these constant thoughts in my head if she is ever thinking of me just in the smallest way i have a lot more things to ask her considering that we ended in a peaceful way
then my mom and sister visit for xmas and i completely nose dive i do not know if this mopey and unenthusiastic character is who i truly am and i just pretend around everyone else i like that pretend character way better and others like him too
i am struggling with everything that happened now that i am well and can not understand how i participated in such deplorable behavior and failed to protect myself
i have a feeling he is going back to his ex even though me and his best friend told him before that it is not going to work because the damage was done his ex knew about me too he swore he is not going to
take a step backand imagine it all disappear just for a little bitthenonce everything is quiet just think think about your lifeyour next move everything
loneliness loneliness loneliness is a complex and usually unpleasant emotional response to isolation i miss my son so much my heart is aching
since then i have had a compulsive need to have a light laptop that i can take out in public i guess
that is fine you can take ownership of them take responsibility you can improve and growi do not know how to grieve or move on i do not know who i am honestly anymore
everything went wild we were drunk guys started making out with guys and girls with girls she even made out with her friend i had sex with
my ex knew that she hurt mein my humble opinion a toxic person is someone who does any of the following
a little background i live in a slightly abusive household where i have always been the person to fix everyone arguing so i have pretty bad anxiety connected to sounds making me think people are arguing alot and have to check on them when most of the times it is just talking or something
i denied him this but he will not stop telling me it means very much to him he promised me we would be together forever we had a child together that we lost
we wanted to go on another trip but we felt we were in no condition to commit to a trip 4 months in the future because we were bickering all the time
i asked for patience god placed me in situations where i was forced to wait i asked for love and god gave me troubled people to help
however the problem is that when i see my family during the day half of the time i have the urge to hurt them whether that be with a weapon or my bare hands
what sucks is i bought an engagement ring and i was going to propose this week i am in school studying software engineering and finance while in the military reserves
and we decided that if we are meant to be then in the future he and i will meet unexpectedly and just know
i do not want to think my family wants to hurt me and i do not want to think and believe certain things but i think about it so much i end up believing them a little
someone at work told me they would seen her out with another man and wowi think that means what is about to happen is real
i am 174cm and weight between 5961kg which is average i think but i go days without eating because i do not feel hungry anymore
i was 1 and a half years free from self harm and alcohol abuse but for the last 2 days i have been taking alcohol and it just feels so damn good to escape from reality even for just a bit and i am scared what i would do if i keep doing this
i wish i could know if he regrets anything or if he realizes his mistake or if he is just fine with out me
from my experience of leaving a abusive person the shock from the abuse and betrayal and torture was enough to make me have a breakdown
i insisted on going she fought against itwhen i cut i bleed too fucking much but it is never deep enough
i found my own help in someone else and yet i was told that it was wrong that my issues should be dealt with by a professional
but this 8th grade year turned for the worse when my friend found this other boy she stopped talking to me and ultimately left me behind in her life
it was march and just then a week after this meeting he became cold and alienated from a loving and caring guy
i am just feeling tired of life can not seem to enjoy things as much as i used to which is rarely and we mostly just share a coffee together
my 21f boyfriend 31m is choosing to support my goal to gain weight even though it will put him at the bad end of situation
my girlfriend broke up with me about 2 days ago and i have been such a messi will just start it like this i am an extreme hypochondriac and i have stress and anxiety induced seizures
tonight she told me over text that she is not going to be part of my life anymore to which i just replied with we are not ending our year long relationship with a text message meet me tomorrow at x place x time
i can not cry infront of them either because whenever i do they just do not do anything and get upset at me
that feeling of coming home after working all day 6 days a week normally 12 hours a day is just gutting
i am still young but i am not sure i want to continue on if there is a chance i might feel this way throughout my years
christmas and new years is always tiring for me especially since i am turning 18 on the 28th no one cares honestly should not have reached out to make friends just gave me false hopes
last friday i tried robbing myself of my life i asked people for help or encouragement or whatever i should call it
i feel like i can not and i get so stressed out over talking someone complimented my outfit on a game today i literally felt so stressed about it and even had to close my eyes when i sent the reply they replied back and i logged off because i did not want to have to answer it
the normal me is extremely motivated positive optimistic and always in a good mood i have not felt like myself for most of the year now and it is been such a struggle to get up in the mornings this year
i tried talking to people but nothing progressed further than someone to talk to in classi feel so bad and the reason is the stupidest reason ever
i am so fucking tired of the shitshow i am living through i ruin or fail at everything i do not even know how to really express things but the bottom line is that i want out there is nothing here for me anymore except more disappointment and pain i write and rewrite suicide notes i want my family to know it was not their faults at all i love them i just hate myself and my meaningless life
i know i get it from my parents because i have just been taught to not annoy people but i feel like i am a constant annoyance when i am not and it stops me from being normal like if i wanted to join someone is group to do something i would be afraid of going because i do not want to ruin their thing
i want to fucking scream and have a release from all of this but i just can not and i am so tired of being like this
all my life i was struggling and it always never worked out despite my efforts i have lost hope and wanted to end it all so many times
he expressed he really misses me and wanted to kiss me but is dating someone else and it would not feel right
i was brought up by a narcissist that never let me socialise outside of school forced volunteering had to volunteer to make them look good and to keep me out of trouble as teens are nothing but law breakingdrug addicts i never did anything bad not even talked back when they talked shit about me was not till almost end of my teens i knew this was wrong
praying ridiculous dressing in a certain way what the hell are you wearing taking a selfie you are not prettyyou look foolish
i have already considered suicide 23 times over the past few months the latest being moments ago where i have decided upon a plan which i will proceed with if something does not make me genuinely happy in coming months
we built our life together already and i just feel like i am in a state of shock almost kind of numb but also on the verge of crying
i am sure this will not work for everyone but hopefully someone can see this and be able to find some control and feel something
i say i think because i do not want to say definite as it is a sensitive subject and i know people go through a lot with it but i have been thinking for a while and nothing ever makes me happy anymore i am not happy at where i am at in life and i am sick of it
3rd breakup she suddenly became a bit distant told me that we should part ways and she will sort things out
i have always been alone i did not have a friend to talk to beforei can not fight it anymore i am so tired nothing helps family hates me no friends
i was hospitalized for the 6th time in my life during this i remember siting in a room with other hospitalized people watching trump announce the national emergency for covid19
my pay for my job is also shit and i have been trying to get a job elsewhere for a month now but have been unsuccessful
stop obsessing over their social media or old photosi know it is difficult but just think for a second what will i achieve by seeing hisher photos and replaying old scenarios more hurt that is not what you wanttry actively to avoid social media convos with them acc to me this is the most difficult part
for practice exercise today and for this week listen to your most most favorite song listen to it everyday and every moment you have and master the song
i was also overweight as a child as well a being an early bloomer my older sibling fat shamed me and my parents made jokes about my weight as well
during this time i kept trying to financially help him however i couldthank you for taking your time to even read this
my ex and i even echanged greetings and i really thought we could catch up even if i am the dumpee but then am ignored felt bad at first but when i realized above i feel so much better
i did not mean to fuck up so badly if i had known how my life had turned out then i would have gotten help long time ago
i have exhausted all my emotional and financial support networks nobody wants to hear me talk about it any more because their sympathy has dried up
i am 35 really can not see living past 55 i can not really see another 20 yrs like this but i always said 55 is the cutoff
now every time he leaves i feel very empty inside and have no clue what to do about it i have been trying to get new hobbies but it has also been tough
i think all the time of the shoes others feel and never feel it is within my right to push my own over theirs
broke up in september 2020 after 2 years together i am feeling a little betterwhich i find drives me a bit crazy over time not to mention
he became so self centered and angry hes only a she will of who he used to be he will not admit it either
all the other shit does not matter i continue to try therapy to make my family feel as if i were trying
i felt so much better after i finally got out of there smelling nice i even used my favorite body wash because why not it was amazing
at this point i was a bit scared but it changed over a few days i was a part of the group and finally had a purpose in life
so it is been quite a while since my last post but i am not feeling any better can not even force myself to be happy
i do not know what it is called or what it is i just know that i can not take much more of it
then i see my cats and start to cry because i love them more than my life i do not even know what i am describing
i started with him not wanting to kiss me anymore and i also noticed he never tells me i am beautiful anymore either he will not even just tell me i look nice td or that he likes me hair or what i am wearing he also does not call me baby anymore and does not want me to call him that either
after 5 years and buying a house together my second having fur babys he decided that this is not want he wants
i just want to be taken care of in this aspect because she does so much for me but when it comes to emotions she does not really recognize how she turns my feelings into hers
my trust issues from my previous relationship that i originally settled rose back and hit her hard it was also around this time i began writing a letter that i will talk more about later on
then before i know it she completely stopped getting coffee with me but she still texted me often then when this pandemic hit she completely ignored me
i was so sad that again someone did not want to be friends with me and i started to go down hill again i have depression
we were basically trying to work out our separation in a healthy way cuz we had a child j and i really hit it off
but my heart yearns for a sense of toxic familiarity they say the hardest part is not awareness but the application from the awareness
it only make me feel worse because it reminded me when i was a kid about eight years alone all day and spend all summer on river alone swimming back and forth
my brothers are both getting mental evals for fas no warning or planning their just getting it ignoring the fact that i have on multiple occasions told her i needed someone else to talk to or that i wanted to get tested for my own disorders way before zach came into our lives and way before she even bothered researching fas
unless i really still should delete lol i recently made a new friend he told me he was not ever going to get sick of me
how do i keep going on like this i am an empty she will i try to do all the things to be happier and healthier but it is just not working
they do not make life worthwhile to me and it follows that i do not feel as though life is inherently worthwhile either
then as i had my job at working at an aged care facility i did not realize he was in his time of need wanting to feel prioritized and know that i was there readily to respond one day he was that close to ending it with a bullet to the brain
you may need to cry it out yell it out write it out exercise it out but you need to get it out
i am so upset bc i do not understand why he wanted anything w me when he still was not over someone else idk i am just hurting and in need of some kind superheroes today
at first when i saw him i felt so sad and was thinking who even wants to date him but he started bragging about how great he is at everything invited me for dinners he would help me with everything also he would tell me fun and interesting stories and i did not even notice how i fell in love with him
i do not know what to do with myself he was perfect and i do not know how i will ever find anyone as perfect as him ever again
my only friend in the entire world is going to be moving away at some point next year due to family troubles it means i will never see him face to face again and i really can not make the long distance thing work online texting even skypezoom never have felt real to me
549httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat349s how does this change with covid lockdown 735httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat455s as a woman how can i bring up this conversation with a man in my life
if you even think of me differently than any other person because i had a few surface level habits which put me on a spectrum with people who can not eat independently fuck you
i am sorry for putting it in this subreddit but i am looking for any advice i can i put it on rrelationships and they removed it so
at one point i wondered if i should have just taken the entire months worth as well as my new medication i believe somewhere around 10mg of bupropion
so i forgave her for lying a bunch of times because i felt like i could change her and help her be better at being honest and not talk to so many guys inappropriately
i am trying to support one of my other friends who is parent is dying but without giving them the wrong idea either because i have always gotten a vibe that they have a crush on me no evidence really just kind of a feeling
an he did that for me with my interests dragons but slowly he kind of fell out of it and started acting distant
a few days ago my ex texted me and broke nc i did not text back but she said she wanted to meet up if i was ok with it since then idk i have felt sad and empty at the same time
i am very new to this sub so i apologize if i am not fabricating my words correctly but i will do my best at trying to explain my condition to see if anyone knows anything about this
long story short i did not have a good summer my ex broke up with me i had a bad relationship with family and i felt depressed for months i made a post earlier this year that i look back on and laugh at because of where i am now
last year he cheated on me and begged me to stay after i found out i do not know how but he convinced me that i should give this a second chance
and the longest conversations i have are with my dad he just asks me stuff like why do not you hang out with your friends anymore why are you always so quiet and when i go outside to do whatever there is always that one word that is also a question alone i know he does not want to hurt or tease me but it still does hurt
i have become such a cynical person and i can not even explain how badly i hate that i used to wake up early to surf before work
i feel sick i feel sick i feel sic but we made the best of it she went off to college in september and things were going good
this has happened a lot to me over a lot of situations and with different people however instagram has not been easy i will admit insta was my go to when i was bored
about it a few days later he would say he did not say that or that is not what he said as a child growing up i felt alone mostly due to being an only child
the id typically functions out of unconsciousness ie grabbing your phone and watching a video the superego functions out of preconsciousness ie thinking about what you are going to do today tomorrow etc and the ego functions out of consciousness ie what you planned and actually doing it
from everything i have read about it online i believe i may have autism my parents also agree with me so it is not just me diagnosing myself i have mentioned it to my doctor a few times but always get fobbed off with something else last time they sent me for a blood test which came back all clear but made me have constant panic attacks for a week until i got the result
she met another guy online we were an irl couple and she said she did not have any feelings for me anymore after a 3 year relationship with its ups and downs
this all makes me feel so lazy and stupid and have some self resentment trying but not trying living but dying
i told him that if i was drunk perhaps i would have sex with somebody but not sober i never intended to do this though
i spent my last 4 years thinking of a future with him i wasted so many days so many people i betrayed to be there for him i put in so much effort so that he would love me
today is one of those days where i have nothing to do but set and rehash everything over and over and over again in my head until i make myself sick
my situation is so messed up i would not even no where to start i hate myself and i do not want to be me anymore
part of accepting a relationship is over is also reflecting on it the good and bad ups and downs was i a good girlfriend he always told me i was not was i to blame for the downfall of us in time i will try to reflect objectively
i really do not want to be his good friend it feels like if someone tells you that they really love you and you do not feel the same way
he thought i was just dropping off a card the baked goods was a surprise so i was expecting a text from him last night because normally he would text me saying thank you but i did not hear from him till 10am this morning
i can not reach out because it is not my place but i can not help but feel something was wrong with me that caused him to leave
so i feel like i am trapped in my daily life she helped pick everything out for santa and we were both really excited
sometimes i feel like texting or calling him and asking why but then i read his texts where he told me that he wants his freedom
a couple of nights ago i had my first panic attack in about 4 years and since then i have had the first real taste of depression
i used to be in subs like this rforeveralone and so on but quickly left after realising that i actually feel worse following them
i did not even give him attitude or any bullshit this morning i feel like he wasted my time yet another piece of me still believes i love him i miss the comfort i had with him
you never liked how i would care way more about others than myself you swore that you would never use me for it i trusted that
all i am waiting for is my moms birthday to be over and my car to be repaired then i can go and execute my plan
would it help if i detox delete my social media apps for a bit i am not sure if doing so will help considering all my friends talk on snapchat so i know deleting that i will not really be speaking to hardly anyone for a while but maybe that is best since it does not help or would this be toxic behavior on my end
that whole or keep trying is a bit missleadingi have tried to be more social but it is pretty fruitless but alas we will be apart
i still remember her calling me and telling me how my parents were ashamed to take her to a mental health specialist
i started realizing my world was falling apart around me i thought my reputation was funny and cool but when it set in it set in hard
she is a very lovely girl and i have not felt the same way about anyone before i feel like i could trust her with my feelings
the final words of nicolas chamfort in his suicide note have always resonated with me and so i leave this world where the heart must either break or turn to lead
by that time i had strong depression i used to cry every day for everything and nothing i got my first anxiety attacks too
nobody else will be around to calm me down after an episode of ptsd or have my back if i need to go shopping for clothes we did that the day before yesterday after i told him my concerns about getting harassed due to being trans in a not very friendly country and he found a workaround
but i know you do not like doing laundry why not just stay here and i told her i wanted to help out
he is telling me now that he finally has an appointment set up with that therapist he wanted i really wish it did not take me ending our relationship for him to seek help
i guess i am just looking for is some advice from people who have personally been through something similar what worked for you how did things improve
so my initial post is somewhere here but in short 4 years relationship he chased me and took me out of my previous relationship horribly in love breakfast in bed and all of that than in october i learned that he was cheating on me with a fitness instructor during his business trips
he just did not feel the same way about me anymore which is fine i am okay with that we told each others doubts and feelings however she started not coming to school
my wife is currently in the process of divorcing me she said it was due to incompatibility i need advice or just someone to talk to alsoi am addicted to porn
and if so is there a way that i could get help without having my parents know they honestly do not know who i really am and probably would be very confused and hurt if i said i needed mental help
so now that i might have covid i am ready for it to put me out of my misery my socials are gone i have nothing of true value and use to leave to anyone no one i would like to seespeak to one last time all i have to do now is wait
eventually i ran out of things to say and so did he i told him i missed him it just slipped out
i ended up promising her that i would at least come over for a few hours sometime later this week to open my presents but i really do not think i should have done that because soon after i started freaking out and having an anxiety attack about having to go to her house and ended up hurting myself i do not want to get into the details
he typically meets with his friends over discord then and on that night i was pretty tired so i took a bit of a nap
i just do not feel happy if i can not share my life with othersis it abnormal to not feel happy if i do not have social interaction
is it normal to have to exert effort to do these things or is it part of some disability what is it called or am i just dimwitted because people say i am apparently smart
i would take a breather refresh myself buckle up and try harder but that would last for some minutes or half an hour but soon i would be back to square one
she had just come out of a relationship and was not looking to start dating anytime soon and he was in a long distance relationship with a girl he was really into and according to her she felt very safe with him because he had no romantic interests in her and so they were able to have this beautiful platonic friendship where they hung out played talked to each other about their dating lives and just generally spent a lot of time together
i am going to leave it off here i am tired of typing but if you guys want to hear me of my just kind of crazy life or have questions feel free to say so also the point of all this is i want to write a book on my life and tell everything i have held in me for a long time
i am not okay right now but i will bei am not just setting him free i am setting myself freenothing that has happened in the last 7 years is better than dyingi do not deserve to live
now when things became worse than ever by the end of the year some people that are close to me rely on me but i can not help them and i can not help myself i can not do anything anymore
i am terribly afraid that i will end up alone forever and the more i live the more i become convinced of this and the lonelier i feel
the only people that she follows and follow her are mostly just other fan accounts so it is like an enclosed community
i am sorry if this is harsh and mean but i am done tryingn to be diplomatic about this i am also sorry if this changes your mind about me feel free to forget me because since i can not forgive you because you are not sorry for what you did you are sorry you got caught i am trying to forget you so please stay the fuck out of my life forever
they have been always controlling everything i do and i was always afraid of them when i was younger and even now i am too so it is almost impossible to move out
we had one good phone conversation before that though and i told her i was going to send a few things
her desire to isolate me made me want to maintain shit relationships and not recognize the shitty people i was around
in this moment say thank you for being alive say thank you for being allowed to wake up and see another day that is the true celebration of life
she said that it is okay for me to talk about my identity but not hers as christiantrump lovingrepublican she is only gotten deeper into conspiracies since he lost
i always underestimated the significance of depression which i say in quotation marks as i have not been diagnosed and i am not going to pretend as if i have but regardless
i know depression and isolation can happen with loneliness making it even harder to reach people it is been 8 days and i have thought about him nonstop how much i miss him
i do not necessarily want to dwell on relationships lost or trauma caused i am happy to talk about it a bit but i do not want that to be the focus more just a distraction and to fill the hole a little i had a pretty good breakup as far as breakups go just kind of finding my feet again
all it took was to have a girl in my bed with me and for it to have since been taken away for me to just break down
i finally texted her after months asking if she was okay and she told me she was just taking a break from everything
i feel like i have done almost all i can my doctor wants me to try tms but because of a recent brain injury i may only qualify for superficial tms if the tms specialists think it is safe for me to do i met a specialist who only offered nonsuperficial tms and he told me i could possibly be at higher risk for seizures he also discussed ect with me and ketaminetherapy unaffordable
just because i can accept that we are not meant for eachother does not mean i do not miss him intensely it does not mean i begrudge the time we had together
so i moved in with my grandmother and i was bedridden my ex came back and apologized and was there for me emotionally
i felt a combination of wanting to show her i loved her and feeling that we had really good time together and felt it was the next step in our realtionship although late
it is a loop i can not exit i become extremely suicidal i go insane and try to kill myself i survive then i convince myself that i want to live and that it is a new opportunity but the loop restarts and i want to die again i am selfdestructing myself until someday it will be irreparable i am dying little by little there is no solution
it depends on the symptoms but sadly mine mach what they call crazy i will not be in the military like all the men in my family and i will not get married
i feel like i should start smoking cigarettes so i can die faster without any undue stress on my family or friends
i no longer really envy those people who seem to have a large social circle are out and about every weekend
we do not have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better stop stalking their social media stop trying to find ways for them to come back to you
it is getting unbearable i cried for no reason every other night and it is making me so confused i was the stupid desperate guy and would drunk message her
for me it is strange that she does not want to talk with me because i am in such a huge crisis and it is like holy fucking shit we need to talk about this right now because i am at rock bottom
tldr is it selfish of me to ask him to remain friends i would definitely give him some time but in a few months when i see him in person again with my group of friends i would want to act as if almost everything is normal just minus the physical aspect there was not a lot going on around friends anyways
i am a teenager who can not drive yet i do not know where it came from but over the past 45 years i have just felt worse and worse emotionally for no reason i have researchedinstagram reddit googling you know and i have found that i am having symptoms of depression like sleeping in a ton hard to do basic human stuff loss of interest in hobbies

she is the same only without the physical abuse probably considering the mess the previous abuse put her through i do not feel comfortable living with my dad either
today i realized something my mother is nothing but an idiot who wants nothing to do with me unless it involves something she approves of i am not a complex person i enjoy video games and went to school until the world decided it wanted to finally give us another disease and you would think under such conditions my mother would want to share or explore at least of my interests
my point is it is okay to be alone on the holidays it might not feel okay it very well probably feels really shitty

i am craving the past the memories are messing with the chemicals of my brain she did her own thing and did things she knew i would not like
mistakei went over again and we ended up kissing neither of us had any friends anymore or knew what we were going to do with our lives
each of these individuals were perfectly fine and seemingly normal the first 23 months but as we got closer dirty laundry started coming out until i could not handle it anymore usually staying longer than i should have
in effect we reached a breaking point and i cut things off and as of now we are no longer connected on any social media or communicative means

it is been 2 weeks this is the hardest thing of my life i try to talk to him but he ignores me or blocks me he claims he is not mad at me and forgives me and is sorry for what he did too but he does not want to talk to me until next year and never wants to be in a relationship with me again
yesterday i was in a friends house using the phone for a while i then pressed the blocked users button after that i saw my ex name and noticed that she changed her profile picture she looked so happy and her smile was so bright enough i could not breathe ears and brain started buzzing my eyesight was starting to become darker and darker could not hear anything my friend was saying felt weak my heart was beating so fast i feel sick of it
to be honest i can not pinpoint one particular reason why i feel so depressed a lot of the time and so anxious and stressed out it just started happening when i was 14 and still occurs to this day at 22
i have had many nights of talking to her and she just sits there looking at me with no emotion and she smiles whenever i smile
i am tired of preparing to interact with people fake smiling and having urges to slice my legs up every other moment
he again yelled and said that he is glad he is finding out about all of this now instead of later even though i have been upfront the entire time and if he wants to hold his friends hand to help her he will and we have different viewpoints and i am crazy
the moment i closed the door of the elevator i broke down and started to cry i did not cry for more than 5 minutes tho it was really short
but it just hurts so much to just watch every thing i love go away like that i still love him
i do not know why but lately i feel like i can not be left alone for even 5 minutes it is to the point where i do not even want to sleep i want to be talking to someone all night

i do not have a girl friend and never have i am 22 my social life has been ruined since about end of 2019 i used covid as an excuse to tell people why i did not want to catch up or got out when really it was my social anxiety telling me to stay home
i have felt this before in a million situations where i have messed up and has caused me to even start overthinking aspects of myself at times
i hate myself when people come and try to give me their love and then i just end up cold and reject them ghost them and hurt them then i end up surprised i got no friends but also sometimes i do an effort and try to accept their friendship but then it feels off i feel like i do not belong there they talk to me because they pity me for being always alone and never smile and i avoid these people
i am very proactive when it comes to not only speaking about my issues but i very much appreciate relating to others
i just did it with a mushroom fineliner tattoo and it just gives me so much serotonin and adrenaline it is geniuly insane
she does not know shit about me even tho i keep on telling her my things my plans my dreams i think that it will be one of those life events that changes you permanently
i wish nobody would have to go through this because it hurts especially for people who end up dying to suicide
everything i say will feel like a movie and that i am lying but all i have to say is that this is all true
i am starting to feel like this life is not worth living i stress my partner out and it is not fair to her to have to deal with my constant fear of my health
sometimes it makes me think that i should kill myself because no one will truly care or be affected directly from my death
i have realized that my anxiety stems from being afraid of what my dad will dosay she told me she needs time to do something is and next week we do it
again your mind is skipping on these things because your mind would rather focus on the positives all of a sudden
i will start this by saying that i hope everyone had a great christmas and you are doing well this can be a very stressful time for everyone especially with all that is going on in the world
i give her space for a day and come back to find out that she went on a date with a guy in her class
my chirch seems to only cater to kids college students and the elderly my biggest interest is anime but i think our town only has 1 convention in the spring

i am not academically smart and i am not good at sports or any hobbies it feels like there is something separating me from the rest of society humankind whatever you want to call it
i live alone and have for a while but i need to move soon so maybe i will look to getting an apartment with a roommate
this is the one thing i could do to make him so happy but its so painful and things can get better i know they can but it just seems so hard from now
i have been through various therapistspsychs in the past this is not my first time getting to one i will be surprised if any single person responds to me
it was a very hard time for me because i really wanted to have a social life i think that if you never have experienced something you just want is very badly but i was really broken from inside
but in the back of my head i am always wondering if i should feel worse should not i feel more upset because i loved my ex so much and i still care for her even though we are not going to see each other again
nonobtrusive automods both traditional and experimental powered by machine learning in order to identify toxicity without relying on word lists
suicide feels out of reach and i just feel stuck in this life i do not want to live i can not kill myself but i can not keep on living
for me it just comes on randomly though as i said before i am not all that invested in other people so something like this probably would not affect me to be honest the feeling that i should be feeling some kind of sadness would probably hurt more
when you finally ended things with me i was upset but i did not beg you to stay i told you how i felt while you told me nothing
nothing matters to me anymore i have lost the ability to feel joy i am just in shock by how insensitive he is
what triggered a new onslaught on insecurities was when she sent him an invitation to a reunion of sorts of college friends not as big as it sounds it would be her my boyfriend and 2 other guys after not having spoken to him for more than a year
i have this she will around me that stops me from building any relationship with anyone it is as if i was not allowing people to show me affection and i do not feel comfortable showing it
i am absolutely independent adult who lives on his own has a stable good paying job a girlfriend and great supportive friends yet i feel like a 5 year old that is too afraid to confront his mom
i have convinced myself that i can not do anything alone so my anxiety goes through the roof if i even think of doing anything new or going anywhere alone
the thing is recently he has become more and more saturated of me that is what he says he can not seem to stand my company or my existence even
please do not be mean about this i know other people here can relatemy lack of religious faith destroyed a relationship that we have been constructing for over five years
from the small bits i had gathered she had been in a highly emotionally abusive relationship and had not dated since so i tried to be respectful
stop trying to find out why things did not work out stop trying to figure out the exact reasons why they left
i really do understand both sides of the coin no ones suffering can be compared to others but is not it even a little bit saddening for the marginalised to become further isolated amongst the minority
like i am invisible or a just a nobody my depression is slowly creeping back and it is keeping me awake at night
i honestly know that she is going to be better off without me after everything but it is hard to live with those realizations and it is hard to live knowing she does not want me anymore
month later he started fat shaming me i can not meet his mom until i am x lbs since his ex wife was rail thin
now i am going to tell you that you are important to me and i need you to keep going i need you to forget anything that might contradict this because this is the only thing that i am telling you right now from one infinite being to another you are endless and so wholly deserving of happiness to me
i feel selfish though because my life does not seem at all bad from the outside loving family healthy financially stable 80 of the time unaffected by covid19

i am addicted to kissing and hugging her and i feel enslaved and chained i am unable to let go and my jealousy my thoughts are literally painful
and yes when i doubted our relationship i did it because i was confused not because i wanted to look elsewhere or have a plan b just in case
what is worse is that not only am i not able to see or meet anyone right now but i know that even without the lockdown i still would not have anyone by my side and that is because even though i had a crush before and was in a relationship for some time i never felt actual love towards any one of those people
i miss her still love her and want to make it work and have her in my life i know i am fucked up
i have spent many years in therapy multiple types of therapy multiple clinicians just be an adult and admit it to yourself
over the weekend i took the time to craft out an apology letter over email to my ex i never had a relationship before i always tried but never succeeded

she needed 247 care around the clock which is where my 18 year old self came in she had another son my brother who at the time was 46

i hate having to interact with my abusive dad he berates me every time i eat and i can not stand it

i decided today that i am going to end my life soon i cannot keep living all alone in a fantasy world in my apartment
i miss the feeling of being needed and i wonder if its all even worth it i am asking or any suggestions as to what to do to fill that void
1 week later i was laughing at video games and felt more sadness over the fact that i should not be happy again so soon but i was
i just do not know what i lack for her to lose feelings in the middle of dating me she told me i treated her really well and i did not do anything wrong that caused the break up but how can her feelings disappear like that i do not get how she can genuinely tell me she loves me only for it to be gone like that
honestly i am enjoying myself and my work and i believe for that reason i started feeling better however i still feel waves of anxiety which even causes me to have some weird twitches at times
it seems like she stopped putting in effort after awhile and kind of turned cold to me out of nowhere which made me try even harder to please her

apart from the typical hypocritical phrases about how good and perfect i am there was nothing else all this along with other problems in life broke me
she was content being alone and did not want to try anyone it is like she went from adoring me to a cold sort of distance over night
when we left things we had a really positive conversation and she said there was still a chance things could be fixed but she needed time
i am currently on the break day 1 and feel awful i am not mad about the fights as this would be much easier to break up on rather i am unsure if i should just end it all and thinkin she deserves something better
i go into it more in a video i uploaded but i would really recommend trying maybe a couple of these things and seeing how it goes also it took maaaany attempts of doing this before i saw an effect it definitely was not a quick fix
at some point a new lover in life would also ensure that i would never be able to be a substantial figurehead as a father even in title only i would just be pushed out and sharing her daughter 3 ways and splitting her own time with me would never happen
5 i cried for a good hour and my heart still hurts and it feels like it is about to explode but i am letting myself feel those things i am letting my mind and body grieve because its the best thing for you
the next 7 years of my life will be occupied with school amp workjust before the lockdown i found out she was seeing someone else she cheated on me
sorry if i make a mistake english is not my first language hi i am 20 and tonight i feel that i do not have a purpose in life

now i know the scope of this mental construct is a bit weird to explain the thoughts and the mind that are there but this is to help give us a proper visualization on how our mind works with these thoughts how they cycle through us throughout the day
that does not change how i feel though nor if you ask me does that make it right people do not know how to feel bad with someone else when they need it
at times i can barely even speak at all my thoughts get so fucking mixed and everything feels doomed but good at the same time

but when she found out i went on a date she lashed out about over something unrelated we resolved it maybe not to her liking but now it is been a week without contact which is the longest we have ever gone without talking
the only thing that seems to rectify the thoughts is either i get bothered by something else which is a negative or a buy something like a game which is positive

i just wish humans would stop leading me on by promising interaction it just hurts ten times more when i come to the realisation that no one actually likes me or wants to get to know me better i am trying to come to terms with the fact that i will probably be alone forever
this is the best start you will slowly train your mind to calm the mind in an active state meaning while you are working or doing something you will be able to engage the thoughts and not feel deterred in any way to act on these emotions
i guess the point of the story is it feels better to have acquaintances versus actually getting to know people and letting people know you
third being too available for someone no matter how bad they treated me being there when ever they needed me even when i had other priorities i lost my value because i let them treat me bad
it is not that bad when it comes to internet friends i want to talk to people in the same way i talk to people through social media but it is just that it does not come out i do not know what to say or what to do so i mostly do not say anything i will just listen and i never know what to say
i am not lazy i am a good person why can not i just exchange my time and skills and live in piece is not how it suppose to work i do not understand anything anymore
my family is distant because i push them away my siblings are always causing drama and my parents try to shove religion down my throat but i am secretly atheist
what i feel is that he is so much more invested and committed to his careerjob than a relationship i thought i was slowly starting to get better with the limited attempts
early in the morning i smoke and go for a walk as soon as i am done working i start smoking it is been the only way i get anything done after work sometimes some weekends it is the only reason why i leave the bed
today i texted him a short response just saying that i was good and thanked him for asking me and asked him how he was doing
i just do not want to move countries till i am older and have worked full time for years but they want me to go as soon as possible so they can get visa quicker
today is a bad day it did not matter how bad he treated me i wanted to be with him no matter what
do i continue faking happiness should i be more open and drive everyone away do i regret not doing it i am still very tired and i do not know how well i can keep this facade up in public anymore
i need someone that is independent and and can do things on her own too that way we can depend on each other
i saw your post yesterday one month with him means one month without me well i need to get this off my chest fck you i am happier without you anyway the breakup was incredibly difficult but i have had great people help me out i will not allow myself to feel sad or mad over you anymore you made your choice see ya later
then i managed to get this house for myself where obviously he could stay it became our home she decides to vent to ot guy about it on facebook
she was always drunk and always putting herself into situations that looked so wrong and even though i could never fully verify she cheated i had screaming gut feelings and i put up with it for so long
i feel more at peace but i also feel numb but no matter how i feel i will always want you
and trust me i tried i tried with everything even being in an abusive household he was the only hope i have to get out of here and now i can not be in the same physic space bc i am going insane i tried i really tried why the fuck is this happening why i am not important to anyone why
what do i do that benefits the lives of others simply just being around them with the mask of happiness and warmth i put up i do not think it is fair to guilt someone into living just because you will miss them or they make you happy
everyone messaged me to make sure i was ok which was sweet and i am but his voice made my ears tickle
it has stopped me from being able to work and i am addicted to weed its the only escape i have as no clinical medication has worked this is ruining my life and i just want to feel myself again
just broke up with a long distance boyfriend and i just want to beg to be with him again idk i am mostly just venting here but also looking for some advice
i am not sure where to go from here i want her back and i want to be able to help her i hate that i am yet again put in a position in which i can do nothing to make her or me feel better and if we both feel very hurt already by this decision of hers how could this be the best solution
do i just be bold for once and be vulnerable or do i suffer for all the seasons because i was too in my head and blew a chance with someone i admire the choice seems easy but all this doubt has me muttering under my breath whenever i think about her
i do not even want to listen to my favourite songs i ended up being so emotionally invested that i just helplessly watched as my body played it
there was this damn cursed but marvellous unexplainable feeling we both were feeling basically every time we interacted with each other or even just looked at each other when we still could
i have got a good feeling about whatever is going to comei am over here having a panic attack all day long damnit why today why
i want to be there for him but i am lost and i do not know how i can help him with my own struggling mental health
and i sit here alone without a live i understand she does not need me in her life but i need her
but 3 days ago i just had to text him bc i wanted to tell him about my academic achievement that he helped me with since day 1
tl dr what could i play on tv to give me that sense of connection without requiring all my attention so that i could do my chores and have that background show
it makes me feel like complete shitchristmas is here and soon it will be gone i have tried finding something but nothing feels like enough
i had a love for him that was so deep we shared the experience of abortion together and i believe we both need therapy after that and all of the crazy shit we went through
he is been loyal ever since and always made me feel super special and beautiful he really is the whole package and then some
then i get back to my baseline of meh are these daily high and lows manic episodes or are they too short to be that
it is hard to write in my journal everyday but i know in the future i will be proud of myself for over coming this issue and being able to put my emotions on paper
advise i can give you if you are struggling cry it all out i was crying for 1 month straight but it eventually stops
i know i am worth more but want to give him a chanceis this normal or at least has anyone else experienced this and know why this is
i do not feel like i love him anymore but why do i still feel like shit not to mention he is already out looking for other women
i found a better job and am planning on moving up in the world i am trying to lose weight and keep up at the gym
i hate life so much just go away please there is no joy anywhere any happiness i experience is soon overshadowed by misery again go away life
almost like a robot i have only 30 minutes to write 250 word essay obviously i can not finish essay on time
my reasoning is simple if i died today no one would be able to feed them or clean up after them today and the rescue would be scrambling to find other fosters to take them
both parties had alcohol present but my dad did his best to hide when he was having a beer his parents and grandma not so much
but then i got better and i am no longer depressed and i am 2 months clean but i am not happy i am not sad ether i am just nothing
i have waited the whole evening for someone to send me a message asking me what i was up to or if i was okay
anyways someone who i was in love with recently left me for someone else she used to get me so high naturally
which i now realize is not fair to him and i feel bad but i apologized and acknowledged why he was upset and said i will make sure to prioritize him
even though i love you have loved you and will keep on loving you we are very different people i will not be happy knowing that i chose to be with someone without the type assurance that you feel for me ironically you were the only one i have met that i saw an actual future with sadly it was just wishful thinking now we are apart and my solitude resumes
so i had this rather strange coping mechanism i would act out or talk out loud as if someone was with me
idk any thoughts on how to cope till marchi have read educational books forced myself to exercise and eat healthy i have done cbt training and mindful meditation
well in 2016 a miracle or so i thought happened i was able to get the funds to go back try again so jan 2017 i went 2 yrs later govt changes nothing she is still there i am here
i really do not want to lose him and i really do not know if this is cheating or not what should i do to convince him i would never cheat on him and that this is the only thing i have lied about our entire relationship
i was in a bad relationship and i always felt like i had to defend myself i got cheated on a lot abused etc
first before i was addicted to video games but from that moment it took me a year and a half to just come back able to play it was mentally difficult
this can last several hours and last night around 11pm she wanted jerky from a gas station we went and i stopped by mcdonalds for a mcchicken and a shake
but i guess i am too much or too needy and they can not deal with me some told me directly some indirectly and some started ignoring me
and now my brother feels angry at our father for putting our family through so much trouble and he feels that he ruined his life
cliff notes are i was molested when i was nine multiple times under the guise of prayer by a camp counselor at a christian sports camp
a little backstory about my bf he developed ocd in high school and has some degree of social anxiety even though he plays it off like he has nothing
i think it is because i think it will toughen me up i also slammed my head so hard i can not hear very well from my right ear right now
i barely talk to one friend let alone see them just want people i can be friends with not work colleagues to talk about work if i worked
all i wish for is someone that would talk with me for more than a few days or weeks just to block me later
i am not going to tell you not to think about them but i want you to write down again every event every interaction
but nothings changed except i graduated but no ceremony because of covid which makes it feel very underwhelming i still live at home i still self harm and i suffer with bdd and issues like that
i try so hard to be nice to be a good sister a good person friend but all i get is loneliness which i feel daily
when i think about spending time with them i feel cold and my chest feels tight anxiety builds and i just find myself wanting to avoid them and curl up away from the world
years later now we are close friends but the torment of guilt of hurting yet another person because of my urges weighed on me heavily at that time
including my bf i have around 10 friends id say 3 of them i might hear from or reach out to daily
his ex was really making things rough for us with the kids so i really was not in any rush but he proposed out of the blue i was really happy but i had my concerns
for some people it is like the ultimate goal in their lifes and for others it is what makes them powerfull or proud
i do not know how to say this but i do not want to be in a relationship and nothing will revive that in me
i try to make up for it as i am not this indolent 100 of the time but it happens enough to hold me back in the things i loveyes i do have passion there is no absence of that i just mentally disappear
its just not his time to realize he has a problem it is beginning to feel like that time will never come
just like i was alone on thanksgiving my only friend is at his aunts house i do not have any family nothing
i was cutting a lot more after me and my bf broke up i started seeking for counselling it is like i could not sleep if i did not cut myself before going to bed
because its what your good atare there even any reasons why i should not live with constant pain everydayi meanstart of my new school was major i walked in
i do not believe she means for me to see it but i do it really makes me feel self conscious because i do not resemble these celebrities in the slightest
do not think about good or bad or anything that can be loosely defined by those adjectives right now nothing is binary
if i stay here too much i might actually freaking kill my self the only thing that i want that i can realistically get is death
or how anyone else has reconciled their decisionmaking how do you know what to value the most being loved and cared for unconditionally over something you think you want conversation ambition etc
we agreed to keep things and casual as we could and had a nice time for the rest of the night
keep in mind he is an ex marine horrible profanity dark humor and also plans to go to the army in january
i started university in september and i am not enjoying it at all every day drags my housemates hate me my university is in the middle of nowhere so i feel incredibly isolated
she does not have an official diagnosis but i am pretty sure she is depressed and i was wondering if anyone had any tips for how to help on a daily basis
i am an adult and legally in full control of medical decisions i have got an abusive home situation i have been dealing with for my entire life
long story short i dumped my girlfriend and now she is posting a lot of photos to try to get a reaction out of me anybody have any good lyrical quotes to clap back
now i am here in our house with her stuff still here all her and our stuff reminds me of moments from when we were happy together
i hate being alive so much every day is just pain and loneliness i hate myself beyond belief and i am tired of it
my family is fucked and i do not feel like it is real i do not really want to elaborate on this mainly because i already made a post about it yesterday if you are truly curious you can look at my post history
that sounds really messed up and twisted but it is true we do we cling on to that familiar pain so write down everything that went wrong because i want you to become fully aware
i feel stuck with nowhere to turn for help and i need to find ways to help myself does anyone have any tips what helped you feeling better and functioning
it seems like he only opens the app once or twice a week it makes my life boring and kind of unjoyable but i do not know if this has serious effects on me
thank you guys so much in advance for reading and reypling everyone who is on this subbreddit is either struggling with mental health or wants to help to those who does so i want to say to you all how amazing you all are and that we are all strong
i brought up how much this bothered me on several occasions but nothing would change i felt really unsupported but i knew she was busier than ever
thank god that at least i see her in my dreams each and every single time i fall asleep and we are having an ideal and perfect life together in my dreams and each and every single time she promises me to become real specially for me one day but then i wake up and realize that my sorry bitchass excuse for a life being saved was nothing but just a dream and my infinite purest suffering without blanc continues
my family literally makes fun of me for it after i have told them multiple times that i am depressed and i always have anxiety
someone give me advice and tell me if he is coming back i miss him so much our anniversary is coming up on dec 3rd and idk if i should break no contact
i no longer fear i may be missing out on life the die have been cast already my lot been assigned my abilities to alter existence clear
all day and night he was all in my mindthough i found no faults but respect from girlsyou have probably read that loneliness is as dangerous as smoking in terms of life expectancy
i feel horrible because i enjoyed it but i really felt grossed out by thisit is also very intense very fast with love and sex
when that happened with my dad i ran out and i have been sitting outside since then i do not want to go back home and see everyone is faces it is obvious i have been crying and i do not want to have to talk to anyone there i know they are worried and now i hate myself for worrying them please help
what person being in a relationship with someone for 6 years describes an ex that way she also posted a picture of protest on her instagram of her in cheetah print he thinks animal print is cheap looking
i have suffered from depression and anxiety for a good portion of my life reckless driving taking drugs illegal in this country alcohol and some of them even bought guns from dealers
i am 16 and my head pains as if my heart is placed inside my skull i rarely play video games but those fucking online classes are killing me
i miss him so much it hurts and i just can not wrap my head around the fact that he blatantly does not miss me
i had been thinking about saying it to her for several weeks before this night but i did not want to say it then because she was so out of it
swiping on dating apps get real tiring as well because i am not much of a texty person but you can not exactly just ask a person out when you barely know each other online so after a while i got real jaded
i am currently in therapy and i am also on medication zoloftwellbutrin which has been helping but i do not exactly feel like the medication gets to the root of my issues
i have spent my life caring about everyone else with little to no care and concern reciprocated maybe it will be okay to be selfish
how do i leave not knowing if i am able to have another relationship how do i not be the bad guy in this and still be safe i will answer any questions as best as i can
stop putting people on pedestals you can be sad but whining and crying all damn day is not going to change anything
i do not even have a speed ticketfor me it did not make a difference if anything i took it as a blessing
there is nothing about this experience or our relationship i will remember with any joy you have destroyed all that ever was
from there i was strapped to a cot and hauled into an ambulance as if i was some sort of package
well love knows no boundaries no rules true love is when you get back home and you had a terrible day and they go honey how was your day
and then i fell for a guy last year in my college the number of coincidences that lead me to him seemed like a miracle to me at that time
i am confused of whether i am just lazy and want attention or i am just really like this because i have moments where i am feeling completely okay but still have suicidal and depressing thoughts
i had a breakup a month ago and it completely destroyed me i loved her and treated her like a princess
i am so sad all of you guys i had a stroke in march and my girlfriend left me in july that was literally the most devastating thing that is ever happened to me the abandonment not the stroke
most people do not have problems with a person being paid for puting their souls into a work i do not know music saving lifes or whatever or basically for most of their life time and efforts but sex prostitution has been banned in many places
nothing to do with web dev itself it was a cool and awesome job it really was the people were cool too having worked 6 months in a warehouse recently i can totally appreciate how cool those people are even more so given that i would recently went out to have some beers with them
i was fine with that because i was in love with this guy so we basically claimed each other and confirmed we were dating
i think it occurs and it is easier for a group to call an individual mentally unwell and perhaps have that person go around thinking they are unwell than it is for the entire group to accept their own responsibilities and short comings the evolution of how society has treated an lgbtq individual comes to mind for example
i have put myself into so much debt trying to get help for my mental health issues and nothing works i have been barely hanging on for five years at this point and i am ready to let go
i have self harmed a decent amount of times but stopped as december started and it has now been almost three weeks since but the urge is only getting stronger
i am not going to sell you anything i just write the best shit out there on breakups and recovery today 15 november is my birthday
in every way i am inferior i am pathetic and cowardly too retarded and lazy to jumpstart my life but too scared to kill myself
i came home and my mom had gotten rid of my bed my dresser and boxed up all of my things she told me she had to make room for my brother to set up a computer i do not stay home often but she could not have even asked maybe i am just being too selfish
the absence of my parents has caused me much pain and sorrow they have not passed they are still here particularly i scratch the insides of my elbows until i draw blood
flashbacks only last minutes compared to that overwhelming feeling of watching your 6 and protecting your loved ones making sure you are not followed home checking corners at work
obviously no one is for misogynistic violence but why is she making us all condemn it right now i do not understand that also holding a 30 year old women back from running like a toddler at 12 am screaming is not assault
my parents condemn the idea of their son having any sort of mental problems so they just deny it and disable me everytime
5 years ago on the 23rd the closest person i had to an actual brother died i did not learn about it until april of 2016
in fact i will stay in the hotel and only walk a block away and then back and then after a few days i return
i had a dream last night about my ex it was a good dream and felt like a memory how do you cope or get over having vivid dreams about an ex specifically sex dreams i was doing so well i was moving on and this morning i am left feeling a little bit empty
i just need someone to actually like talk to i still miss my ex and every time i try to talk to my friends about it is it is fuck him i mean yeh but i miss him
we hugged for well over a minute and both cried openly at the tube station as i was leaving when i got home hours later i hopped straight into the shower and just sobbed uncontrollably
socially anxious perhaps the group they are in they have been bullied or outcast or talked about behind their back is toxic but the individual is the one labeled with the problem
i feel like she got herself together at my expense i then noticed my medications were not there he took them among a vast amount of other things
the moral of the story is that it is really rough at the beginning life might seem to come crashing down when they leave you but you just have to remember that time changes everything so hang on there because one day you will be happy with someone will love and support you for who you are and if you ever need to talk to someone you can always message me
i think i am doing what i can do great i cleaning up my room having good 3 meals per day getting workout and sunlights and meditation although recently sleep schedule and workout is low than usual
i have been this way for years now most times i can deal with it others i just lay here and exist feeling like a weight of sadness crushing me
couple of people around me had similar situations happen to them in last two years and i was there for them whenever they needed me and i am there for them whenever they need me period i pride myself on loyalty
so to everyone who is newly single during the holidays and in the same boat believe me when i say healing is not linear but it is possible
it feels like like i am remembering a different person or dream i had everything i ever wanted back then a wife two daughters and a house
i was in the bathroom shaving just doing my normal stuff and as i was checking myself out to make sure i was all done i thought wow people are really going to miss seeing my face when i kill myself
i am sorry if i sound extremely miserable but i do not see a reason to live anymore because of how worthless i feel
any advicemy ex and i are coming up on 2 months no contact and things are getting really hard it just hurts so much
something like 34 times lethal dose for an average person as a smaller person tried to go to sleep woke up a few hours later violently shaking seizures i do not know never had or seen one before and sweating could not see uncontrollable gagging but no vomit some other more disgusting stuff
i was doing data entry which is less tasking so i naturally found something to occupy myself it was one of my biggest complains
i never asked to be born into this shitty life i wish i could donate my life to someone who desperately wants to live
they know that it is not my fault but they sometimes claim that people are not being true to me that they are just feeling bad for me which is why they choose to hang around this is the reason why i do not trust anyone in this household and i have trouble trusting other people because i feel like when i become vulnerable around other people i am just giving them the ability to hurt me
a distinct trigger that i have been able to identify is that it is more likely to occur if i am with a small group of friends or people and the atmosphere is one of closeness or intimacy
the scene plays out in my mind and i imagine my parents being in fear of their lives i start looking around and noticing that people are acting suspicious like pacing or looking around
does any of you have a feeling that passions you have had in the past are now just shells of themselves like things you continue to do because you have enjoyed them in the past and they do not feel like that but you continue to do it because otherwise you would do nothing and cry
or maybe a country that would do an assisted suicide even if you are not terminal it is a shame that so many people commit suicide and their organs go to waste
because i like to think of it this way ask me in the comments if you want that thanks to anyone who replies
we finally set a date to hang out and she tells me my then still gf wants to hang and i express i am not trying to cross boundaries
how did you succeed in making new friendships and maintaining themi can not stand this loneliness anymore if i can not sort this situation i will get depression
when she came back into my life recently i thought she was sincere and it was almost as if a weight was lifted off my back i felt like i can finally put this hatred to rest and have a bit of peace
my dad does not acknowledge me once when i was 16 he did not talk to me for half a year and my mom just yells things at me like i am an animal in their house
i feel almost angry that i had to suffer the brunt of everything i fucking hate themtruth is the religious part do not work for me the scientific part only works temporarily
reading upside down in my bed bike riding running swimming spinning dancing warm embraces loving laughing living which is something i have not done in awhile if i am being honest
i want to start eating again and have healthy full meals every dayanother problem in regards to this is that i am not vocal about how i really feel
he texted me three times in a row yes yes yes and so i asked what he wanted to talk about and he said he just wanted to hear about my day
i still think about her every day and i hate myself for that i hate that i hate her for this and i hate that i still love her
any advice for people who have been there to what it is likei have depression and anxiety possible autism i am 15 and its getting continuously worse
while also giving as much love as possible and i barely got any of it in return and out of all of the days she tells me on christmas morning
however i feel somedays such as today i crave the company of a large number of likeminded people joining together over a well cooked meal
she said she wants to celebrate our anniversary i surprised her with that we celebrated it privately she said she really enjoyed it and felt loved she said she loves me she always say that eversince tho even we are just randomly chatting that she greets me good morning and goodnight then i love you
i did not cry when my grandparents died but now as i am writting this i can not hold back the tears of solitude i am feeling going down on my face
my seasonal depression has not filled me i am happy as in summer did that out break modify my brain and give me better results
approaching my thirties starting to see the damage done and the rest of my life shaping up to be a path of coping and compromise
then coming to terms with my identity and acknowledging that i am trans which at first was filled with happiness but as well as shame doubt sadness pain joy
also i managed to get my only electronic device which is this phone i am 16 btw my mean ass mother would probably be happier without me and so would the world be
i just feel numb nothing hurts unless i think too hard was somehow starting to make me feel hope again i hang out a couple of times with her
i have not had any physical comfort for years no hugs no pats on the shoulder no handshakes i had not had verbal comfort for years either until 3 months ago but that was over shortly if someone were to hug me tomorrow i would break into tears i am beginning to feel dead inside and scared i am scared that because of my loneliness i will become someone lacking in emotion and be unattractive to any potential romantic interests
love can be experienced so many ways but once you have experienced it in real life it just gives you such an appreciation
so last week my ex boyfriend 29m broke up with me we have been together 3 years i work my ass off for a corporate job
i respond with a funny message and ask her about xmas i texted back right away i get a closed ended text a few hours later
i desperately want to have a pet but i do not have the money to own one because if anything happens to them i do not think i will be able to pay for their veterinary fees
he was my first and only boyfriend prior to the breakup we always talked about moving and marriage and kids so i was so dedicated to this idea of a future with him
i have friends but i can not connect on emotional level she did not seem very pleased but we left the house together
but after atleast 16 i notice he just started to be more glued into those internet friends of his then he is with me
you are selfish ungrateful and your dad did nothing to help yet you still kiss his ass and btw i do not kiss his ass i am just civil to him since he is still my father
i wish i could die in my sleep or from a natural accident or whatever i just can not do this anymore and no one gives a shit
he persuaded me that i was mature for my age it was an emotional abusive relationshipenter my name i have been thinking a lot and i am still conflicted about our relationship
my family hate him so i will hold off telling them for a few days but i had to share lovely anonymous internet strangers i have to talk to someone
i want to leave so bad but i feel like i can not there are other things i want to do but i do not feel like i can
please i need help or advice or anything really for the majority of the past year i would say i have had a fairly acceptable reaction to pandemic protocols
if you bought something together and that broke you still have your own version of it you still have you and this is the mistake we make
why would he tell me to not hesitate to text him if i need anything when he never cared when i begged him to talk to me after he broke up with me i begged him so many times and he did not care
i still love my ex deep down and want him back but i know that i have no control over his emotions and want to move on so that i stop hurting myself by having false hope
she was saying she felt distant and that she just felt like she was out of the honey moon phase as she called it
i asked her why she did this and she said that i should not be reading her messages and it did not make a difference anyway
one of the keys was sticking and i popped it loose but broke the clip i tried to superglue the key back on and the key would no longer depress
it was very mutual and i think for a while we saw it coming i know it is in my head but i worry about it still
i usually stay silent within games because i am so afraid of talking my mother keeps saying i am just shy and a hermit after i freaked out about going outside because a bunch of other children were playing nearby because i did not want to have them look at me or try to talk to me because i am afraid of that situation
this quarantine does not help to meet new people and i feel so lonely and stuck i want to do what 24 years old do go out have fun live their lives
when i am alone i will watch livestreams on twitch and i pretend that the streamer is talking to me so that it feels like i have a friend talking to me like on discord and stuff
they tell me to break through and that they love me but i can not break through its too thick and i can not breathe
his last words to me cuts me deep and he promise he would never leave me and will always love me
meanwhile i dreamt about her all night last night i am so hurt i am so mad that breakup made me scared of relationships how bad it hurt everywhere and my shit job at coping
we just want to listen to you and be there for you as we have been there for each other through our transformation and personal experiences
bedsides i do not have the strength to try to fight them off so when they appear i just kind of accept that they are the absolute truth about myself and i do not care about it like i do not even know they are not real anymore and i am kind of sure they are but i am like ok and almost as it does not matter at all
i do not know why i just can not get over her i know it is my fault for getting attached but i just thought there were mutual feelings between us
i just can not help but feel worried all of the time now i do not even want to go to work because i am so scared
i guess i am making this post just to see if people can share tips on how to cope with this feeling of loneliness
every time i turn around you are in my face you better back tf up except this time he was talking to absolutely no one
i am hoping that this is just due to staying at home for too long and that once the pandemic is gone this shitty state goes with it too
i feel as if i have nothing left for me i have thoughts of suicide after every minor inconvenience every random break down or burst of anger sadness
so my ex and i broke up about a month ago it was a mutual break up due to long distance and overall not seeing a future together
as said in the title i would be happy to help as much as possible with my own experience anyone who has any questions about it hoping that it will be helpful to someone
and now comes the hardest part in this letter i just want to stop hurting i just want to be happy with someone else just like you are
even when exams are approaching i still do not feel motivated in other words there is no motivation left for me to do anything
he joked that his thing was to be the funny one but it was a problem that i might be funnier than him
of course i have at least internet strangers but what can they say if it is just the tip of the iceberg and they never really seem to care enough or in case they do care they do not really understand what i need and it is so simple
he just said dating was stressful and i was like how he was like because all you ever want to do was party
after coming home in march my relationship with my parents was fine then i graduated college in may and started studying for the lsat for my law school applications
hey guys my ex and i have been broken up for 6 months and i am still having a really hard time moving on
i know that after two years of this i need to move on but he is my best friend and we talk all the time
last time i did well they got mad at me just for me telling them that i dated a girl that i liked
do i like this shirt no i do not like this shirt ok fine i do not like this shirt i do not have someone to grab drinks with so it is nice to just get it all out
i asked the voice what it was it said just a voice in your head i asked it the same question today it said you were all you
nothing pleases me anymore plus i am completely alone and probably always will be i took her to homecoming my freshman year but she was not ready for a relationship
once again i am getting the horrible feeling of being surrounded by people but still lonely i think that i might have just had a mild panic attack
so needless to say the bad times were straight out of the dsm it is very refreshing compared to past experiences i have never had a love quite like this before
it was so confusing to hear and i was so hurt she tells me she loves me but than cries over an ex for an hour
people always tell me that life gets better or it changes but i am seriously starting to doubt iti am 18 that is a good age to die at i have no one everyone leaves i am killing myself goodbye
anywhoooo going to go enjoy today with my family and try not to think about him merry christmas to you all
like jfc no one stays in my life i did not let myself fall but it still hurts that no one fucking stays around
he hits my sister while i am away at college i can not stand to be around him anymore even when he is happygolucky
and was approved but i never received the pin that i needed to get paid and am disconnected due to call volume when i try to follow up
we shared a lot of the same interests and we even did each others hobbies together it was the healthiest relationship i could ever ask for
at some point after 7 months of being unhappy i had noticed that my best friend of 17 years was now single
i am 15 years old f and i have been seeing a psychiatrist who is now my therapist i guess i see him every two weeks i do not think it is helping
so i 36 f have had 6 relationships my entire life quiet and introverted social anything makes me sit in a corner with a good book its always so amazing to find that one guy who can coax you out of the fortress of self soothing isolation or is totally worth jumping the metaphorical wall for
i do not get why i bother to do anything i suck at everything and i got paranoid a few times since having alcohol like it is strongly cautioned against drinking alcohol with this medication so maybe that is why
it was like she did not know what she wanted we would talk about breaking up for two days then we would talk about how much we loved each other for next three days and we kept going back and forth
what is even more intriguing is that higher esteem makes it easier for you to express desires such as wanting time alone which will do wonders for the attraction between you and your future partner
anyway i ended the relationship with him as i felt like it was the best thing for both of us and i found that i started fantasizing about other people and it was not fair i continue on a relationship with him while i think of other people
his reason he wanted to move out of the country for work but the real kicker was he did not have an offer nothing he just decided on this in one moment
she left her facebook messenger open on the laptop and when i opened it and logged in the screen already displayed their conversation
every little thing reminds me of her and i cannot seem to separate her memory from everything that i see and every place that i go
then i go over and we were cuddling and she says she has to get ready for work which is not out of the norm
now all that time we spent together i spend thinking of her i constantly do things we used to do together just hoping i run into her
i am glad he responded although there was no obligation to it gave me the opportunity to react and reflect in a way i want to
maybe i should just smile and take it like they want me toomaybe i should only care about myself and not about the girl i have a crush on
and like i feel like if i leave this world without saying everything i want to everyone i want to then i will not be okay with killing myself
we spoke everyday well recently and i mean as recent as last month he started to randomly fight with me for nothing like not talking to me or ignoring my messages then we started talking again after about 2 weeks during that 2 weeks i had a breakdown and attempted suicide not really to do with him but some of it was
what am i living for these temporary distractions that keep me from thinking about how lonely and unhappy i am what is the point of going on all of these experiences i am accruing by myself amount to absolutely nothing my life is a farce nothing means anything to me anymore
helloooo i was wondering if anyone could help me out because i really feel like i am losing rn and i just need to talk
he came to my city in june and spent 10 days together then i went to his place in south italy and spent 15 days in july and 10 days in august we had not met since august
send in your still life image of lifeless objects age country to valueoflonelinessgmailcommailtovalueoflonelinessgmailcomyou are not alone and stay healthy dear people
it took me a week and a half to move out back in with my mom 36 and living with my mom
i am so afraid of what i am becoming as i was driving home last night from his friends house the roads are horrible
he will be gone to a new place living a completely new life without me and i want that for him but i also want to be selfish and have one last hug
i am 25 and things seem like they are falling apart i just feel like i have no one in my life i have friends but yet i feel as tho i can not speak to anyone i constantly fear dying alone
granted i am not with her every waking moment but what she is showing is not what i am showing i have already made a plan for my suicide
he did not realise how much he hurt me or how much i actually cared i told him everything about my feelings for him
i broke contact twice once to get stuff back and once because i cracked and i feel like i am at that point again
i have been alone for so many years that i started thinking i would be alone forever she helped me not think that way anymore
he is social yet introverted and talks to his friend group online and i can hear him laughing and talking all the time and this just compounds my intense loneliness
i will likely die by the age of 50 due to heart failure slowly suffocating to death also because of this i physically cannot have children
btw we were together for 4 months but i could feel that she really cared about me and was really invested so this feels very sudden
i do not want to keep burdening the people i love with how i am feeling whenever i am feeling low i could not get myself to end everything but i am so incredibly tired of living
i have spent these past 4 days crying off and on getting completely hysterical barely eating due to how sick i feel having troubles sleeping at night and waking up constantly in panics
i am overwhelmed by anxiety and depression these days my family and friends are supportive and i am grateful for thatyou with all the questions and only some of the answers it is you who deserve love
i would kill myself if i was not a coward but i promise myself i would not do it until i became a doctor then i would simply not have a reason to live but i am so impulsive i fear that i would just do it a lot sooner
i am trying to mentally let this go and i would like some encouragement or advice or just any thoughts i want to talk it out
idk if this will ever over idk if i am stuck with these thoughts and emotions i just want to be alone and i wish i could talk to a psychiatrist or therapist but i do not want to tell me parents i just want to get better mentally i miss feeling my normal self
last night was one of the most vivid dreams yet i recently quit smoking pot and i have heard about having vivid dreams but this one felt real
do something today that makes you feel alive if you do not know what that is well sit present for a few moments and allow it to come to you it will come
but on the 25th i snapped at my bf really bad over something meaningless objectively speaking and felt myself falling apart
it is been two days and i have been crying so much the hardest part is the feeling of wanting to talk to her i wish i could be best friends w her with just a snap of a finger but i know it will not be that easy especially because i still genuinely love her
i stated that if she wanted to be with me then i would work with her i know all my desires and requests for working on the relationship are delusional but that is what i felt
new years will come then blue monday and people will pretend to care out of performativity rather than true care it is a valid cycle that will forever continue because being fucked up and wanting to die is every bit functional as it is to have these days reoccur year upon year upon year
shortly after starting uni the quarantine came back with its restrictions and together with my ever growing feeling of loneliness the feeling of alienation towards everything that was related to studying came in
when we are young we are raised to believe in a disneyfied sort of life there is someone for everyone follow your dreams and things will work out be yourself but the older i have gotten the more i realise that these things are hollow
i come from an abusive family i barely keep contact with i have run away even from the country as soon as i finished high school and i never returned
now i am alone in a house with no one to talk but my dog all my life i have been helping others to stand to their feet and be positive thinkers
a relationship is out of the question i am way too awkward for one but if i was ever cheated on or broken up with
all i do is watching youtube listening to music and eating chocolate i really hate this as christmas is coming and i can not make myself to do anything for the family like cleaning making food etc
he spends so much time on the computer doing projects he is a manager for a tech company and he has much work to do but he does have his free time
during the summer of 2019 she raped me in my home i never reported it to the police out of fear that no one would have believed me
the same happened last year i really did not enjoy christmas and now it is happening again i am starting to think that maybe i just do not like christmas i am not religious so i have no obligation to celebrate it
i asked my mom to not have this conversation she says ok immediately starts the conversation anyway i did not want this to start because i knew what would happen queue my family shouting at me for 40 minutes and making fun of the fact at around 35 i started crying i asked them to stop shouting queue them saying and i quote we have not raised our voices once and then continuing to shout at me this has happened to me hundreds of times so now i am sitting here
when i feel like crap sometimes i just need someone to tell me i am ok i do not deserve love i do not deserve parents
she made it clear that she was not going to see anyone else and that she wanted to get back together once this was over
but the thing she still did not look at my fingerbut the demon just stop her with hes hand on she is head
but things started to change and the more and more it did the more and more distant you seemed i am going to miss the nights we sat there and just talked all night
i am just asking for advice or something or to prove to myself that something just happened then or can someone tell me what this is
i spent half my pay on a bottle of johnnie walker so i guess that is a problem but yeah even so i was able to help my stepmom which pulled me out of my languid state
i am 25yo and at this point in my life i feel like i should not care that much about my parents opinion
i have met people along the way but they would mistreat and emotionally manipulate me so to protect myself i kept myself to myself and did not make friends
he saved me when i was born will he save me now i know he exists just by looking at his creation
that she wants someone who already knows what they are doing and we can not keep trying because unless she is in a serious relationship she just wants to have fun and fuck around
hello i am 20 today it is been rough a hard day at work and the year anniversary of my house burning down and losing a pet i loved a lot i will not be doing anything tonight because i do not really have any friends anymore and i am a little sad honestly i could really use a few kind words from kind strangers rn
i hope you will one day feel like we can exist together tooit is midnight i have slept all day and i am bored i am new to reddit so you get to hear this
my ex broke up with me because i am such a downer to be around and i really did try to not be
i cry sometimes in my bed at night wishing this nightmare will end this is my version of loneliness and i been wanting to talk about this for a while
then i remembered today is christmas eve my father was cooking the capon and my mother was chilling if it was another day i would have hit her
i am weak and foolish i will never stop mourning our relationship i will never get over her she is an integral part of me since we basically grew up together and were inseparable
they asked me to choose civil engineering i didi also form unrealistic bonds with people far to quickly too quickly to be normal
at first i begged as lots of people do and she did not care so i knew i had to move on and not talk to her
i feel like the only basic thing i will ever want out of life will never come to me and it makes me feel like every second is just a waste
i have withdrawn all the money and investments i have saved and put it in an envelope for my parents who i know i am a disappointment mistake to them
i have my best friends my family but why do i feel so empty like something is missing i always feel lonely like there is none there with me i feel unloved unnoticed and unheard when in fact it is all the opposite why are the amazing people in my life not enough why do i still have to go searching for some kind of attention to feel relived
i have had terrible behavior this year after i quit smoking i started to realize how fragile our lives are i did not miss it at all too i used to smoke 5 joints 15 cigarettes per day and only eat garbage being fucking skinny and did that for 9 years then i think to myself holy shit you are going to die and for what for nothing
my vision began blurring and i kept repeating the words i do not understand why can not i understand i just want to cry and hug my partner
me and my gf break up at the beginning of quarantine and a few months later me and this girl connect and during the summer we started talking and then a month later dating and i had some of the best memories with a girl i had ever had
my circle of friends stopped contacting me and i have accepted that my neighbors seem to think i abused her because she left the house with nothing but a suitcase in the middle of the night also family has turned hostile and continues to bring up memories of my relationship without failing to blame me condescendingly i have said nothing and i have stopped speaking to every single one of them
now i believe he is making me look like the bad guy i get in my own way i am the queen of self sabotage
i realized that i am the person who text to others i never ever get a question like the simplest how are you
let us just say she had an extremely rough go of it growing up in south africa though her parents abused her both emotionally and physically
my bf of two years dumped me because he started falling in love with someone else he is now with her
i grabbed her by the arm led her to the door and pushed her out not hard then covid comes up it is then when i realize i am lonely
some are inherited and there is no way to prove the source of income for that many years of court battle expenses on lawyers is ahead
i am a little bit far from human natures and i am the closest one in his lifewhy it is been almost a month
no one in my family has ever wanted to spend time witharound me and they have never ever entertained the idea of us being even just fond of eachother from a distance
i am going to keep this brief cuz i know no one is going to read this anyway tell me why i should not kill myself
i guess i do not understand how someone could say they love forever and then hurt you this way i feel broken
it was a mess for scheduling and it really strained the relationship basically pitting us against each other they wanted a break to let things settle and i complied for a while
by now i would have thought i would be in a long term relationship or have had at least a couple of past relationships but nada i have no will power to do things i enjoy i even have to force myself to go on runs but i have stopped again i have go no hobbies i have no motivation to do anything anymore not even write
besides seeing my kids open their gifts this morning today fucking sucked i am so depressed and just over it my kids are my only reason for living at this point
my future is ruined ill never get a good job with two fs on my transcript i am not going to force myself into your life if you do not want me
i tried getting help i contacted kids help phone and texted them about how i have a knife and blades in my possession and how i planned to use them they did not give me advice or anything all the responder said was that is so brave of you to reach out to us and then ended the conversation
3 months before she left she stopped sleeping with me because she thought she was asexual due to her rape trauma i was patient with her till she made out with a female coworker and i got pretty upset she dumped me the next day
first things first what do i actually do in therapy is there stuff i should know before i go deep into iti am very nervous about it i understand the person on the other end is a professional and that but still revealing my deepest emotions and feelings and trying to work towards being better just leaves me feeling so anxious
she was all i had left and noone seems to understand it i am just tired i am sick of not being allowed to sleep
before that i lacked the willpower to finish what i started but it seems that the third attempt may be successful
a month ago i text my ex i have wanted for years to break out of the life i live but i do not know how
it is like my mind has gone into complete autopilot and has been that way for i do not even know i have not really felt anything at all and i do not know how to get passed this
i feel as if am alone in this and i am terrified that i am going to be miserable forever i just do not know how to change i do not know what to do i am just really fucking scared and really tired of feeling like this i feel out of control
i do not know your pasta is done though momi think people who use having a bad memory as an excuse are pathetic mom
someone suggested i have social anxiety but i do not act weird around actual people i am perfectly fine in crowds i am only anxious around those inexistent people i read a lot about it online and i think i either have paranoia i do not believe anyone wants to harm me or some schizophrenicschizoïdeschizoaffective disorder
since it being christmas eve tomorrow and having it be almost a month and a half since she broke up with me i was thinking of calling or texting her to wish her a merry christmas something like that i am not ready to give up on her yet i am giving her the space she wanted but i was thinking that would be the nice thing to do but what do i say
i told her i want you to be happy she responded we are very happy the thing is i do not want her back ever
huge fight breaks out from when they came home to 3 days later the police were called 4 times my bedroom door was broken down they took my phone
i feel like everyone is either at my throat i had one drunk bf get drunk and try to choke me or trying to be neutral
and i really feel the need to take my life because i am sick of my looks and my mentality and despite much effort to get over it i can not
take ownership of your life often the issues you are having at work strongly correlate with home life relationships physically etc
hi so i know i am a bit young to be on here but i thought i would give it a try here because the responses are better than in other communities
i could think about it and id have a reaction but right now i can think about it and nothing it actually sounds interesting as is i am curious if id still be so numb while i do it
this way of thinking will surprisingly make you a happier and more selfaccepting person and most importantly someone who holds a healthier dose of selfesteem
it is just that most times when i feel happy its only temporary and its only a matter of time before i break down again
sometimes on a good day we do have a good conversation and we text each other as we did when we were in a relationship but that is not often
now if you can stay away from stalking them it is the right way to do it you are going to think about them at least and you will check up what they are upto
after that it felt like domino pieceswe chatted a bit but i was pretty busy at the time so she asked me for my ig
but i feel disappointed that i have failed and that i will have to keep going until i can figure out the best way
if you have read this i wish you all the best with kind regards arnoif you feel lonely during this period of pandemic
but because of everything i did to get over what had happened i developed a fear of getting to close to someone and commiting to a real relationship again i did not want to lose someone again by opening up only to have them leave me if i messed up or did something wrong i just did not want to go through that again so i hesitated when i should not have
how can i start making progress or feeling better again when i am in this statei have been suicidal for years i overthink everything
third i do not know how to set a course that would ensure high chances of solving it in the long term
i could solve the problem before that of how to study well how to write a very solid masters thesis how to prepare and absolutely nail the final exam to finish my masters degree in economics and university
i have discussed this with loved ones that i always go to them when i can but it is not mutual no one ever visits me which feels like maybe they do not want to see me so they are willing to allow me to put all the effort in they have said they will visit but it seems like a big thing for them when for me to travel it is standard
it is up to you to show them that their treatment of you is wrong and the more you weed the people who do not respect you out of your life the less isolated you will feel
at some pointsadly or luckily i do not remember it shifted to be sexual my family was rather dysfunctional and i did not have proper support systems
they even said that this is not trauma its the beginning of a clinical depression battle thanks to those who bullied me for being white again this is 20022003
suddenly all of their phones started ringing like someone find a cure to the plague or somethingthey all come back running my way like they need to tell me something in fear
she said it was okay and that she was over it and still wanted to talk to me i am a dude btw she admits she has feelings for me on my bedroom floor
for months i have tried hobbies i write a lot and make music though my mental state has heavily impacted the quality of both since it has become more of a chore than a fun pass time my sister is 5yrs older than me and has not dealt with her own mental trauma which only causes her to get mad at me for my near zombie like state lately and i do not really have any friends
i spent 4 days surrounded by the people i love most i realized that i have a village of people who are here to hold me up when i can no longer bear it they spent days pouring love light and warmth into me showering me in niceties and adornment they called me beautiful told me i was worthy that i deserved best of everything and i am starting to believe it now
i have not found it at all i am unsure i will ever find it honestly more than anythingso i am looking at getting rid of this computer and finally buying a gun
i was not confident enough but she help me through it she told me she will never be like the people who hurt me in the past
the final one he could get on was you are too close to the guys in the department idk what to do or feel
going from 0 100 in an instant definitely is not the answerhow do you go about managing something that might upset you or make you angry
recently we started some kind of fbw which is the most stupidest way at all i know you said you have thought about our break ups for weeks
i love her still but it is like i am scared of letting go she refused i grabbed her by the arm led her to the door and pushed her out not hard
i have been trying to get better at it but i have no idea what to do and my constant questioning is wearing down my boyfriend
if i do not text her for like a half a day she will get mad at me if i say something that can be misinterpreted she will misinterpret it and get mad at me
i had another panic attack but i did not tell anybody this time after about an hour sitting on the bathroom floor i got over it
to read the full article click the link below let us discuss what is addiction what does the word mean to you
i have to take care of some major things like hospital bills but i shut down everytime i think about it
she said this will just keep on happening if we continue this she said she is too tired of dissapointing me and she wants to be alone
i am shaking i hate christmas i am so isolated what is the point why am i even here i am a burden to everyone in my life
bruh it was almost exactly the same if not worse those bitches lied then there was this other time that is a huge red flag
when asked he said oh it was entirely her doing it is not that i do not have friends but my friendships are what you might call
yes i am being selfish i do think all the people that might get hurt which are only a few but all my life i have been trying to please others to help try to be a good person and this time i must think about myself for once and last time sorry
this will probly be my last post because i am better off dead anyways so bye and thanks for reading stay strong
people refused to talk to me and everyone was on the side of this kid who kept bullying me every single minute of the school day
like i would like to be able to tell people about myself and get personal in a conversation it always seems that when i do they lose any interest
you walked into my life at one of my lowest points and i will forever appreciate that about you she literally is my everything we had two perfect kids together
because we never got close enough we never had the bond that we needed to have the relationship we could have
my depression was too much for him and he left i went crazy i will not be able to tell him about the good days
my friends do not even care and they said if i need anything to text them but when i text them they completely ignore me and make me feel like a human piece of shit
who am i where did all my friends go asking all these questions because the answers does not matter so i snort the next line and feel a little bit better
lots of things happened that year and the darkness in me keeps growing up until abandonment my mother had chosen her boyfriend over her kids and entirely stopped caring for us
i wanted to call the samaritans but since it was christmas eve all the lines were busy i wanted to wait but i could not wait any longer
even tho i made the decision to walk away i am so depressed now that it is really setting in i can see how much trauma he really inflicted onto me
so what do i do when the medication and therapy does not work i keep asking about other types of therapy but the gp just suggests the talking therapy again which clearly is not helping i am trying but i feel like i am getting nowhere
they see me as the bipolar depressed loser at 25 who amounts to nothing i am not going to be a lawyer like my brother or a real estate broker like my older brother
so i dated this guy20 who was younger than me23 and when i met him i was not aware of his age and assumed he was older because he acted very mature and planned this whole intricate date for me
whenever i make a mistake or fall short in something i have voices in my head tell me it is always my friends from middle school
i know i have been there caseworkers talk down to me tell me to ignore my education ignore my knowledge and be gleeful over used clothes and poverty existence
alway angry when i found her cheated behind my back she alway said she is special and i can not never find a girl like her
and all the worse is that bringing this up with my friends or coworkers just taxes and makes them feel more guilty
i keep asking them to just hang out for a minute but they ghost me understandable i am fucking boring i just wish that i could tell them what i am going through
what do i do is this common i am genuinely scared at this point and on top of that i always have this thing like whenever i am too happy i just assume something bad is going to happen and it usually happens since i am really energetic and happy right now i feel like my finals are going to suck
haha that is a fucking joke the one place i feel normal sharing my feelings and they call this place a joke
this all happened yesterday i am literally 12 mins from him right now and apparently i disrespected him and he will not tell me how i disrespected him because i have no recollection of disrespecting him now i wasted money time and gas just to be stood up by a guy i loved ended it then an there please tell me i did the right thing because this hurts
yes i wanted more i wanted to feel cared for he would call me perfect we spent so much time and we learned so much about each other
i would be really grateful for any feedback thoughts or comments you have probably read that loneliness is as dangerous as smoking in terms of life expectancy
now do not judge any of your thoughts and experiences like in zen buddhism simply observe your thoughts do not make attachments to them
i used to think all i was what people did to me that everything that was wrong with me was me and that would not have happened if it was not my fault
i thought if that is the only thing preventing our relationship i was sure as hell going to remove that variable
he did not just open the door he yanked me out we never talked about it that means if you feel you are broken
but really i just want to be put out of my misery i have been severely depressed since i was a kid
but the reciprocation is not there and it is not just the same group of people i feel like it is nearly 98 of the people i have met in my life
but i will say this i still have nightmares but here i am nowi know that you can feel something deep down now like a bump to your chest
i am beyond saving i just want to die and be at peace that i die in my sleep anything that allows me to die without having to do it myself
right now i just feel like my life is a mess of so many mistakes i have made and i want to fix them but i feel like i am constantly anxious and having mood swings so i am never clear minded enough to know what i really want
i did not know someone still cared it is still hard and i am still fighting my demons i did not tell me girlfriend about this
i come up with many stupid ways to fix my confidence lacking mindset which in turn sabotage me in the future due to me not realizing that this feeling in my head is the reason for all these problems i have been having in general
i love my family but know for a fact that their lives would be better off without me i am so fucking tired
i also stopped caring about most things i loved him so much i never knew i could be that happy until him
i have no plans to end my life at this point but knowing that i have failed to be taken seriously in my field of interest instills me a feeling that all i should do is take a gun to my head and kill myself i have no shame in saying this on my main
her parents were from russia i am a huge russophile and am attracted to women from that culture but she was colorado
it seems that nothing will change this and honestly i can not even imagine why i wrote all thisas title suggests i am having a terrible day emotionally i hate my life and the world today
between the 23rd and 27th of december me my mom and my brother are staying in my maternal grandmother house my moms brother also lives there
i do not even know what i meant by that she felt that once again i saw her as a who are and that i did not respect her
i have never had darker thoughts before in my lifehow are you all doing this christmas eve what are you up to wherever you are
i hate friendships because i feel like you can never be as honest with friends as you would be with a partner
i may seem like a kind to not be interested in dating although i would actually like to start doing that but my social anxiety stops me from doing anything
i just want someone it could be a significant other or just a friendeven when you do not want to because deep down we all do
my mom got her self a new mac book and an iphone 12 but i can not everytime i miss her so much
firstly i do apologize if this is the wrong sub to post this on but i am not exactly sure where else to post it and i feel that this community would understand where i am coming from
the physical part of a relationship is very difficult for me my last and only relationship was 8 years ago and ended after it got physical he was very religious and could not stand the guilt that came with the feeling he was my best friend and i felt used
i weigh myself down because i just can not ever do it right people say freinds will love you for who you are i honestly do not know who i am anymore i gave up trying in 8th grade and just hated everybody in 9th i went quite because i realized that it was easier to do that then deal with potential failures this year i finally thought i would be able to change things but it all just came back the same way it always has it ended with me just being left in the dust and i do not know how to think what to do or where to stand that
i do not really want to vent things out to my friends because it would destroy their christmas spirit sohere i had to go here thank you for listening i am planning to write a last note now
i never screamed at him or anything abusive i was pry just offended or upset which was warranted a hugger a man that needs those subtle touches
and once i was older it felt like it was too latei had this label placed on me and i behaved that way all the time so what was the point in changing
that date ended up with us making out in golds gymhe was the general manager and got us in after hours because we had been drinking at a spot nearby and neither of us wanted the date to end
when you think of abuse and the effects of it you hardly think about things like having a parent keep you safe at night or keep you warm but it is now affected me more than everything before
i simultaneously see myself as a normal flawed person and a person of greater value than others who knows more about the fundamentals of human existence and significance than almost everyone else
we kept fighting over the same things so i did respect his decision when he said we are just not happy anymore
and i am battling with i am waiting for something to happen but as each day goes by i feel even worst and nothing happens
i will admit insta was my go to when i was boredsomeone i see as my closest friend made me promise her that i would stay alive for a year
i have this philosophy that whenever you are feeling down you should help others who are in need like i want to feel appreciated
in therapeutic terms the ego a third party has the highest influence between the id and superego then he never texted again
we have telephone calls and video chats but it is amazing how much a person can miss just patting a friend on the shoulder or the human contact of shaking hands and hugs how i miss hugs
this is the place where i start saying clichès like time heals and take it day by day and although they are used very much they are true time does heal taking it day by day does help
it is just that i can not stop and i try to get everything i can from him even if it is just the physical aspect
she tried to reconnect with me a few times over the years until last year i finally gave in and we started talking again more and more regularly
sometimes i feel as though it would be great if a channel existed where you could learn about a disorderillnesshave someone interviewed who suffers from it with a montage of clips from real life episodes or breakdowns and then what helped them with links to resources and perhaps how other countries take the approach to mental health
i used to feel resentment but now i understand that maybe it is bad luck that i am not all the problem they are a problem too
focus on what you can make of yourself in this one short life you have so that when death comes you can give her the middle finger with a smile as you whisper your last words and exhale your last breath
you do not have friends because your energy gets drained being around people yet you need to have them in your life
he even asked for a quickie and i said noi felt burning alive inside like there was an empty hole inside that was sucking my guts out
if someone entered my house they would put me in a rubber room because i talk so much to myself and it just gets harder and harder everyday
right now i am feeling extremely lonely and have no opportunity to go out to meet reallife people so i would be very glad to meet a girl here which is feeling lonely as well so that we could help each other at least a little bit to not be that lonely
i lost the love of my life in 2009 when she passed from her diseaserelationships are a school they are meant to teach youwhat you want exists do not settle until you get it
and i do not have to doubt about that or hope for whatever may or may not randomly happen it is going to be hell for the coming n years but after that there will be nothing an eternal anesthesia
you talk about how you had a friend who just up and left for no reason but you did that to me
i guess what i am struggling with the most is the what ifs what if we were meant to be together how do i move on when every fiber of my being feels that way
i really want to talk to a psychiatrist but i can not afford one does anyone know anybody that does online affordable therapy sessions via email or something
when she comes home from work she tells me about their shifts together how funny he is and the incredible lifesaving things they get up to
the one that is just good for schoolwork and nothing else why why have i always been alone maybe there is just something really wrong with me
i am very lucky in that i have a group of kind loving supportive friends however their opinions on sex and sexual relationships have continually made me feel sad and like i do not belong
i told my counselor i felt suicidal and when the news came back to my father he screamed at me about how it was a coverup for my poor grades
i told my parents i submitted my applications in early december just to get them off my back when i actually still have not submitted them yet to this day
and before anyone says just get a gun i can not i live in the youk and i have a history of mental health which would mean i will never be able to get a license and other means i would definitely back out on the sea i can not really back out on as once i am there being a 90 pound girl i will never have the strength to swim for long
on the train he was asking my why i was so negative all the time i told him it was due to his constant bullying behavior towards me this weekend he then replied that this was not true he was referring to my general energetic pattern i never gave him the answer which he wanted as there was not such one he did not like that
my brother suggested finding a group of friends like in hospital playlist so that my years at med school would be easier i actually would like a group of friends i know i have just said i enjoy being alone idk i am very confused
whatever the thing is that one day me and my mother were lying on her bed i was probably moving a lot and being restless suddenly she grabbed me by my private parts and told me that she would not release them until i stopped or something like that
a ghost wondering this world without a purpose alone and lonely without any real companions and i just keep buying stuff like games gadgets etc these used to keep me busy
oh and here is the kicker she said she wants space and to be just friends but it is not like a full breakup so we can not see other people
we were in relationship therapy for 6 months which also showed that we had different attachment styles and really came from a different background
my mother has always been an alcoholic and possessed anger management issues ever since i can remember she also admitted that she married my father only because of societal pressures she never loved him
here is a simple explanation when our relationship ends a part of us actually dies when she first brought it up i begged her to stay and we would work on it
others just did not really do anything meaningful that added something to my life i guess it is not their fault but it is frustrating since you are told that is what is supposed to help also my high school did not deal well at all with me and even after a year since leaving i still feel the shame and stress that they imposed on me
he said he put her in dirt after that and trying to be a good person now but i can not forget what he and his mom did
i passed it off as a result of lock down i went to her moms and hers place from thursday to monday once every two weeks and not having a normal relationship dynamic
they may have once cringed in a bad way when you asked them to introduce you to their friends and you never wanted to meet them for trust issues or anything you wanted to take care of your partner and blend with their surrounding so that you can be sure they are safe around them like getting to know the family you want to be part of your partners life not for insecurities
there is a guy i have had feelings for for a few years and he could not care less about me past a hook up and we have not spoken lately anyways
vast majority of people working in this industry is not even present to the responsibility they bear it is really comical at times a circus unless you are the one in need of help they are trying to learn to give then it is not so funny anymore
this is a secret that i have not told anyone because i am too embarrassed by it the lonely feeling is killing me inside and i feel like a burden to everybody around me
has anybody else felt this or experienced this quarantine is over and i have no one to meetchristi do not even know why i am typing all of this it is all pointless in the end
hi guys i am not very good at putting things into words but i am going to try it is no ones fault but my own that i do not have an education i partake in destructive activities
that was a mouthful but it basically translates to deceiving others into believing that you have a physical or mental illness for reasons other than secondary gain
so my ex left me 5 months ago after 2 yrs her reason was she was not happy and did not love me no more all this was told over the phone
like the title said it is been 2 days free of self harm i know it is not a lot but i am trying to get as many victories as i can rn it is been an up and down battle with self harm so this is the longest i have gone without cutting so i think it is worth celebrating
another scenario that might be on your mind is when a parent brings their child to a clinic or emergency department and exaggerates the symptoms with hopes of getting more advanced care say the child only started experiencing symptoms this morning yet the parent complains that the symptoms have been around for a few days these situations are not really what we are getting at though they represent something different
he is very successful in his profession and unfortunately very egoistic because of this he made a lot of enemies at his work
i wonder how i wonder why i am still lonely and i actually do have a feeling it is just getting a little worse
i tried to fight my own demons as he continued to tell me how sorry he was that it had nothing to do with me how much he misses me and wants to see me and that he just hopes i forgive him for this and for the lack of energy and i told him i understood and kept asking about him every few days or so
i do not like small talk i only talk about things that are really profond and deep and i think people are scared to talk about that kind of subject because it makes them ask to much question about themself and the world we are living in
the girl he cheated on me with is still trying to contact and pursue him i threatened her so she is more determined he wants nothing to do with her i gave him an ultimatum shut her down completely where there is no interpretation or a chance with him or let me go he thinks it is mean that is how nice he is he blocked her and want nothing to do with her
after taking time to think over everything my partner and i last night eventually the call lasted hours we both did not want to let go reached the conclusion that in the end we just seemingly are not compatible for one another with a dynamic similar to a avoidantanxious one
i need to sleep but i been crying anxiety and depression kicking in this came out of nowhere for me i was really blindsided
i have been making an effort to spend time with this guy bc he chooses not to spend any w me and complains about it
i have already felt so lonely this year because my family is so fari need to sleep but i been crying
i feel like i am constantly in purgatory just waiting for something to happen all of these things never satisfy me or make me feel fulfilled
i can not fall asleep at night unless i lay there for a couple hours or stay up very late some nights i sleep for 10 hours
the destination is always death anyway you just ask people to prelong their suffering thinking you are doing a good thing
my brain is like oh let us just fuck it all up again because its what your good atare there even any reasons why i should not live with constant pain everyday
i did not know it at the time but i was in a state of psychosis i had already been suicidal for a very long time but it was the state of psychosis that actually put my plan into action
i am still finding things of yours in my apartment after 4 months out of the blue i can see that all you need is everything i will never be
i have always done this and i want it to stop i am not sure how to really combat it as i have tried a few different therapists that really have not been able to solve said issues and am currently on medication that helped curve it for a little while when first getting in my system but is slowly coming back again
the security lady was concerned as she took notice and she even tried to put me with some girls of other groups to see if i could make friends at lunch time but it was as awkward as it sounds and never got anywhere
i was thinking of leaving via plastic bag she interrupts my thoughts scratching on the bathroom door i feed her and so her litter and then get a blade to sh at least she walks in and now i am playing with her it is nice to have someone around that does not sleep at night either
she seemed like she was in love with me but just recently she said that she was in love with that guy and she does not feel happy in our relationship anymore
ill never get a good job with two fs on my transcript i do not want to do it today or tomorrow but i feel like my time is running out
when i called him later he was mad at me for reading his phone he told me he had trust issues
does anyone have experience with someone they love accusing them of not being the real person my mom keeps saying she knows i am not the real me
you were laughing to much you seemed like you had such a great time by my side it felt like you would find me cute
i have realized that i should not and will not take the blame for anyone in my life leaving and that this state will not only pass but will have meaning and that i should not take it as a setback or a down part of life
that all seems rather harsh and frankly things are not that black and white his birthday is approaching and i am thinking to not message him because i do not want to upset him
lately i have not been feeling good at all and i feel like my whole life has been an illusion and that no one really cares about me
we were basically the foundation of a small group of like 4 borderline emo edgy dumbasses the other two of which were considerably more laid back
you do not need to depend on anyone but yourself if they do not want you in their life anymore than it is their loss
we make a mistake of putting our confidence into a car we make a mistake of putting our confidence into a relationship
i wanted to go abroad to get a better education and a better jobi do not know if i could suceed i keep failing
honestly i do not know why i made the post that i originally did i thought that i could find solace and relate to other peoples narratives but i find that what sticks out is the idea that everyone is story is unique and no two people are the same that is how people are all different
i start seeing her and explaining my story and how i feel and after a few sessions with her it all comes together
my now exboyfriend just broke up with me and told me he is had doubts about our future since we started dating almost 4 months ago
the tooth was connected with my sinus which caused some problems and i had to have a facialjaw surgery i woudlnt wish that pain on anyone even my worst enemies if i had any besides myself
at age 1012 we never really had proper meals daily we never had a source of income because we are both minors
that is when the aggressive boy said that he would stop if i just did something my mom got her self a new mac book and an iphone 12
i continue to be devastated but i will move past it i understand she needs to move on it is hard but i get it
recently i have been seeing white comets streak down very fast in my peripheral vision or a very quick white flash or even one time where i saw black cracks emerging from my view
or that they do not deserve your attention because they discarded you that all seems rather harsh and frankly things are not that black and white
i moved frm my home state to his to be with him and start a new life w him he claims to still love and care for me but his actions show otherwise
i do not know if i want to see what 2021 or beyond is going to be like my business venture has failed
safe to say she is moved on quick considering she found someone else in under 4 months so much for not wanting a relationship for a while lol
but he does not seem to care so much for my siblings and iit is been two and some weeks maybe almost three
i do not know i people are suffering and i feel a sense of impotent anger as if we have let one another down i want to do something
i am now telling everyone that is reading this to say that i am not ok not physically and definitely not mentally i need help and i do not know how to fix it i feel like if i do not fix it soon then i will not be able to survive with pain any longer
and i realized that a few days after we broke up but what i can not understand is why he is acting out this way towards me
i have been trying to help in any way i can unfortunately i can not help much since i live really far away from him and we live on a small island so running away really is not an option
for example if you believe you are unworthy and incompetent give yourself a few weeks of thinking the opposite that you are worthy and that while you might not be the most competent person in relationships you are getting better and that is good enough
i have a few methods in mind but it will be hard to pull off failure is 100 my biggest fear right now if i try and fail everything will be so much fucking worse
fuck thisanyone want to join a discord to make friends and talk i started talking to another friend i had in middle school but i am afraid i am driving her away too
even so i was able to help my stepmom which pulled me out of my languid state i think i was happy to feel useful again
i asked her if she wanted more time but that would only mean that i lose out on the eligible age of marriage would it not work out later
the other 30 was when we got to see eachother irl and it was always amazing we were so happy together anytime we could be there physically
do you realize how fucked up that is do you realize how much i wholeheartedly believed you when you said the man that reached out to my friend who found this out with me was bad news the thought that he was telling the truth did not cross my mind
i was not there for him he did confide in someone we were still together but i felt i broke the vow of which his profession lived by esprit de corps never let a fellow marine down i did the opposite of just that
i have anxiety and depression and i have a history of self harm but i did not know if this could be anything else or if i needed to bring it up with my therapist my nails and fingers are pretty banged up constantly and my legs have little marks up and down them should i be concerned or am i just being dramatic
we were going to do it with our close on and it just happened that does not change how i feel though nor if you ask me does that make it right
i honestly know that i do not deserve her after everything i honestly know that she is going to be better off without me after everything
i am living on my own do not have any friends i have been sat here on my own now since march 24th going a bit nuts now i normally have the day to day life to get in the way
for now i only have you the strangers of the internet why do you think i should keep going because i really can not answer that question anymore
it might be long so i apologize but i have nowhere else to turn i am sorry if it seems all over the place my mind is not really in the right space right now
i thought it was crazy and looked into it more at the time but forgot what it was called does anyone know what it might be
and now here i am once again stuck in another city alone the four walls of my bedroom are driving me crazy
why does it hurt so much to be rejected by those people that seem pretty effed up themselvesas he was my first boyfriend and i wanted it to last i did everything to make him happy
i can only keep up the facade for so long but the truth is that i know i can not survive adulthood i can not answer the phone without crying i can not get through an interview without feeling like i am on the verge of death i can not even order food at a drive thru without having a panic attack
i think this is the only thing i can do right in this life my life was not so great though
the problem is that our separation did not last we hang out in the same group and eventually at one party she came back to my place and we had sex again
but on the plus side i learned that i can not continue to live this way i need change in my life and human interaction i do not know how this will happen but hopefully 2021 will bring better things if not i can not see myself living this way past 30
i am angry all the time so fucking angry so full of hatred for everyone i want to knock people out over the smallest infractions i was not always like this i used to be full of love and empathy i seem to get worse every year
so yeah even if i want i can not restore myself my life and brain type fanfictions not work being horny and supress it by it not either do something no sleep no dreams i being killed no fucking way out
like actively trying to improve myself maybe or stop laying in bed and go back to that school since i always had the chance to without thinking about the reasons i did not want to return there even though we were not going to be in the same class
doubts are roaming my head questions like if i were the best i could or if i were the most attractive that i could be for her and i seriously do not know how to act right now
and of was moved out of the department i was back in pharmacy all the work i did for electronics i completely fixed their backroom their security room ext
i feel abandoned in a time of need with only my own devices left to me to make the best decision with while hurting
she is been amazing in my opinion even with her defects like not willing to talk about what is wrong right away sometimes for example
i am made amends with life alright everything is my fault going to do it jan 1st 2021 hopefully family is happy about this just want them to br happy and my only way is doing it and let them be happy because i am always the problem and not the solution life is not like it suppose to be i guess hope ya have a wonderful 2021 i know i will be
i am 20yo fell in love for the first time last june was 18 then have not had a gf or even a date before
i can not fight it anymore i am so tired nothing helps family hates me no friends i was torn apart my world was ruined
we went through so much together as friends already i even got rejected by her in the past before we even dated
people treat you like crap if you are unemployed does not matter if you are a carer like me if you are unemployed you are just a lazy piece of scum but hey what about some of the rich people some have had everything handed to them and if you are rich well guess what it is perfectly fine to be unemployed
i know i said i will try keeping this short and i have really tried holding back from more things here but i am rly sorry if you have read up to this point it was just really bugging me and i wish there was some sort of magic that would make me get all my pictures back again i feel like such a mess
i feel like it would be so much easier to be the one broken up with because that is it it is the end you have to move on and forget them and that would at least be easier because they hurt you by breaking up with you
so after my breakdown 2 years ago with the help of a therapist and 2 psychiatrists i can say that i am a functioning human
now if you know me you will know that i have being funny as my life purpose i devote all my time and energy to get a laugh
i never physically abused my mother but my sister did once when my mother did not to take us out for a promised dinner night out and they started arguing and my mother told my sister to just hit her with a belt so that is what happened
i will be fine for a few minutes or hours and then it will hit me like a truck and i will be freaking out
i then got put on a medication for bipolar 1 patientsthis medication made me very emotional the most important thing in my life i want to fix this all so badly
i thought i would marry him i spent so many nights in my room just thinking about it the pain you feel when the person you love turns into a stranger again is incredible

i love him to every pieces of body and soul someday people are going to start caring about me and that is going to be when i am dead
keep a smile even if it is not real just be nice towards the people around you as much as you can when you have problems talk with the person or get help from some professional do not give up on everything life hits hard but you do not have to hit back
my therapist says it is anxiety and i guess it is but the treatment is not helping it stopthey say universitys the time in your life where you make everlasting friendships and relationships what a fucking lie
something in my brain seems to constantly remind me to not even try because it is a waste and will lead to nothing but regret and humiliation
i got so hurt and depressed because i actually loved him so much and was willing to spend my whole life with him and then he pulled this shit
normally i can control or direct my attention but this time it was different it started as a knot in my stomach
i think this is what made me like this anytime i get mad or i get in an argument i raise my voice
when i turned 12 i started to become more outgoing making new friends and actually spending time with people previously i only spent time in my room playing games or watching anime occasionally visiting my only close friend
i do not want to keep living life is just upsetting and is a perpetual source of upsetting events and reasons to die
i will start this off by saying i am a 17 year old guy who has moved countries 5 years ago and felt lonely ever since
i think i just want some form of companionship and interaction that is not forced by people i barely know i want someone to take the time to know me that is it i guess
she said no over and over again i finally stopped talking to her and i hung out with an old friend of mine
in this godawful hellscape of a year i lost my uncle in july he was one of two male rolemodels i had he helped instill morals in me and helped raise me
i feel exhausted and sad and frustrated i have never had a girlfriend or felt loved sometimes i feel like this life was punishment for something i hate how cruel people are and how little control we have over what happens everyone in my life is gone i do not understand why life is so painful
this basically is just me making a new discord and talking to those i really love and cherish instead of trying to interact with people who do not really reciprocate my feelings
she originally was a hothead but i supported her when we started out and she learned to be more patient especially to me
i am the one who finally broke things off about a month agoi started to play with closiest road sign was early morning and mom cames to my room
is this the real deal with being so emotional even at times it makes me accuse myself of being too emotional or to dramatic with handling life it is what it is and i should live with it
this pains me more than one could know i know adoption is an option and i will likely go down that route
i realized quickly that he truly had feelings for me and although i pushed back i was falling hard for him too
it off to eat something whatever it is and if the outcome is not what they imagined in their head not thinking about what there is to work with and what can realistically be done they have tantrums and curse you out tell you that they have never had a worse experience
i also graduated etc so i made a lot of improvements i did not want to go to school so they did not make me and now i do not have an education
i just find out my ex bf 23m that broke up with me 3 weeks ago is in rebound relationship and this girl is posting photos in his clothes it hurts so muchhow i am supposed to deal with it i reached out my lowest i have panic attacks and i am shaking i wanted to text him but i know it is not good thing to dohelp
this year i will learn to show no pain and start to show less care in their life they do not need me they have assured me of that
i always get jealous of people who celebrate their birthday for a week or whole month and get 2 or 3 birthday cakes
we go on a break and for 2 weeks i am a wreck her bf reached out one day and i just straight up asked if he was responsible for our break
originally my family was canceling all christmas gathering plans this year due to covd my boyfriend and i were going to be doing christmas together
she has a family friends going to graduate from college and people post many things on her nudes while i am alone nobody talks to me failed college and got no family only my mother but she is sick and even says to me that she is going to die all because i decided to stay for her
so i walked away i told him i could not do this and that i deserve more right now i do not want to try and kill myself again
i do not know why but the moment someone starts talking to me my mind goes completely blank and i saydo some stupid stuff because i can not think straight out of fear
it is the disconnect and feeling of distance andor misunderstanding when in the company of others that can gnaw at me and make me feel deeply alone
so i am thinking about my life now and in the future and i do not think i can be useful for anybody i just lost hope on my future i think that my life would be something like survival and not living
noone wants you because you are disgusting he is just too nice to tell you that i dash up the stairs and have this
once i started to appreciate things about germany and focused on those instead of the things that i did not like i noticed that i was more magnetic to people
when it comes to the creation of anything that is worth seeing or the becoming of anyone worth being these things take time patience is key
at the same time i was angry and i thought why would you show them to her now and not me in the past
people hate my ugly appearance and so do i i wish i was not the race i was born as all my old friends have forgotten about me they will too and their lives will be better for it
we met few days later and things went well we were friendly and met few more times she was confortable with light touches we had genuine smiles and she even sliped and used nickname we used to use for each other however she insisted that she cares about me but does not romantically love me and that she genuinely wants to be my friend i believe her but she mentioned group of friends she met at an online game during the quarantine
no boy has ever liked me and i am not even ugly i am just so awkward and do not know how to talk to people because i used to be ugly when i was young and bullied by girls for being fat and ugly
i never had anyone to call or talk to since i usually either have to make the first initiation always or get ignored and rejected straight up
i started to say that i was going to but then i realized that i was not really going to spend money on something that i did not plan on cooking and so i decided to put it back
i formed a less serious but still intimate relationship with the person and it was nice no fear of commitment and i thought no fear of attachment
it was a simple drop this off at my moms and ill grab it later type thing i sat and cried over the next few days really having opened that old wound
everyone keeps congratulating me on reaching this point of my life and it makes me sick it reminds me of the things i have not done yet and all the things i could have achieved
it is know so quiet at home they life with us because before they having the tv on max and screaming at the tv they have screamed in there sleep and know it is so quiet but it feels so good
i just hope one day i can wake up and not feel like this anymore but i am still staying strong i still have hope i know one day she will break
i told her to basically shut up and i refrained from insulting her or saying anything rude she continued sending me disrespectful messages so i blocked her
so earlier today my mom told me to help my grandmother with making lunch because she was having terrible back pain and has been moving non stop since she woke up this morning
i do not really know what is happening with me and i am not really concerned i am sorry if i am over sharing in this group
it sounds crazy but i never felt so much pain in my life jumping off a 2 story did not hurt me as much as not dying did
just the thought has me completely broken and lost i can not imagine myself with anyone but him it is too much i do not know what to say anymore sorry
my exwife and i had been together 14 years 65 years married it is been two years she is moved on and is content with her life i did so much to hurt her i can not blame her but i miss her and cry pretty much nightly
i kind of feel lost and can not focus on something for a long time i can get distracted very easily does this happen to anyone else how do you deal with
on top of that i caught my now ex having sex with a close friend of mine at that time and my friends during that time covered it up for a month since they said it was not their problem
i do not hate you i could not even if i tried the final one he could get on was you are too close to the guys in the department
i moved to canada 15 years ago to start a masters degree as a 24 year old with aspirations i was excited for the new experiences experiences i convinced myself were important for my growth as an individual that this is the time to push myself outside the comfort zone i am not sure i was prepared for what was coming my way
preface i am aware that there is a fine line between the two terms but to me a realist is defined as rational grounded and focuses on concrete ideas and proven facts
so of course she has less time and is caring more about her boyfriend now i do not even know what went wrong and what i could have done better it is just i am so insecure now
i have to take what i learned in this relationship and apply it to my future relationships to be the best partner i can be
i have posted this somewhere else but because i am an anxious mess i feel like its going to be removed after 5 minutes
with all my strength and efforts i gathered myself back again fighting all anxiety attacks for example she is currently antivax but not even main stream antivax like the next level
ironically that was the biggest slap in the face i would ever gotten because i was instantly made aware that _hey actual friends do not routinely hurt each other
i decided i would just write hear because my friends and family have be exhausted by my lamentations okay some of them would probably listen but i still do not want to burden anyone
i have struggled with mental illness my whole life lost everyone close to me my mil is the most tragic person on the planet
it is a huge struggle not to drink just to soothe my emotions and ease my mind about what i have lost both externally and internally
hello everyone just wanted to direct you all to argo a new short film streaming site that just created a playlist focused on mental health this is such a relevant and important topic considering the pandemic so we want it to reach as many people as possible you can download the app through my link argomediapagelinkodvjrfaykfxsuws47httpslinstagramcomyouhttps3a2f2fargomediapagelink2fodvjrfaykfxsuws47eatomppowei4aemb6n1vuzblmus_adezcobxf2cnl8hhqu76dii6awomramtk2kqjxp0ievdyostrnnv5yrgs1fbclidiwar0qu_fzebkl6st7a5ag8xbnb_kaj2madfh4hzntl1nzxtyyn6dhwg2l6g
please can someone dm me household medicines you can overdose onanyways deleting tinder hahaha i do not know how to meet people
it has been a constant battle to not end myself i even picked out a tree in the back yard along with a cable to secure around my neck
after that he slowly got more and more distant and i felt it many of my friends had busy families and siblings to take care of something i could not relate to
i later take him to his friends house so he could apologize and they did not want to hear it later he told me that being in the car with me made his skin crawl the next day he tells me he needs space to clear his mind which i understood however he was on grindr non stop for a week and i called him out and he says his ex of 3yrs would never let him drink and drive of course he would handle it diffidently he is knows him better and he pretty much blamed me and everyone else at that party for a situation he created and unfriended them all on facebook when they did not immediately accept his apology
but he is so resentful towards me he does not care to listen to my endhow can i do that how can i improve myself too thank you for reading
you do not have to feel that i want you to know that your break up does not break you for context i have been diagnosed with depression anxiety and bpd
i am only dreaming about this happy end and when i wake up i find myself back in the sad reality that i live in
i have been sleeping way too much this year i have always known 100mg of quetiapine is kind of too much for me but i never told my doctor that now i am trying to reduce it by 25mg i only took 75mg today and my goal is to sleep well for this month if i succeed i will aim at 50mg
i feel like many around me is plotting to hurtkill me but i feel like everyone thinks that message accepted i quit
to them as i learned over time it was no big deal at all just being social and making time at work more enjoyable that is often the case at work it was naive of me to think that relationships and bonds and love and friendships would just naturally arise at work that is not what happened at all granted that is just common sense more or less
with my current challenges in mind it would be great if any of you out there could let me know which kind of therapy you think would be best for me any advice would be hugely appreciated
people eay that i was really pretty but i do not see it in the slightest and it is so difficult trying to avoid seeing your own face
it was the first and so far the only time that someone has looked me in the eye and said i love you and not because i was a family member or because there is some societal expectation to do so it was the first time that i heard these words because someone actually loved me as a person for who i was
also any feedback on my definition is welcome i think it has room to grow and evolvei am looking for any sign of hope after this hard break up
they told my parents i am lazy irresponsible and that they never met a student who was lazy and disorganized as me
i have really made a huge effort to hold to my new job which envolved high pressure results i was all fucked up
she has another guy after her only thing is that he is 12 years older than her and everyone is telling her to avoid him but she will not cut him off either despite her knowing he is bad
i just want to do something that i want to do againi have not done anything i wanted to do since 2004 i mean anything
my mother a devout christian immediately declined and prayed for me and my brothers speedy recovery we both of course recovered
partially due to covid restrictions here in london and just plain right fuck this guy kind of attitude try to reach out to so called friends and it is just like meh whatever
i like to believe though that i am a victim of living this life and yes this feeling is most active for a week or so around my periods
maybe this is a distraction or a rebound this happened when she ended her previous relationship and it did not even last a month because the other person ended up not feeling the same
if i wanted to i could easily get all caught up about melanie again and cry about her i choose to ignore any of those thoughts and accept that that is in the past
and i have tried to talk to another close friend f14 and she is just romanticized it and said stuff like oh how cute and will act like it is an ideal friendship
no i am not homeless nor lost my job this year due to covid i have not faced some unbearable trauma nor lost a loved one this year
there is a reason why he has not come back yet sometimes people are meant to come into your life but not permanently
please someone respond i just need some support and some answers i did not choose to be gay i did not choose any of this
i know that for male models athletes and sex workersporn stars drug abuse and emotional disorders are rampant but i willingly lie to myself and try to hurt people i am actually envious of
it is not even that i care about me basically my husband and i are going through a really rough patch that is an understatement i feel completely alone
every person i have fallen in love with has taken advantage of me or left me in some way i am sitting here in my cold basement room bored and lonely
i believed in you so much i thought i was going to live the rest of my life by your side
i played games i made conversations with people while ignoring the fact that this problem was not completely gone my older sibling used to tease me a lot without knowing how i felt
in addition to that two of my closer friends decided to cut ties with me because they simply do not feel that the relationship is good for them
pushing myself to achieve them and using substances to keep going has lead to breakdowns and left my cognitive abilities in shambles
at one point my ex packed her things and went home but she did not seem angry or worried so i was fine with it
its my first time posting something shame it had to be like this anyway 2 months ago my then gf and i broke up wed been together for a year and six months and i have been trying to deal with it but i just can not and i do not know how to cope with it how do you guys deal with a break up
i treasure the memories we had together and i am sad that its over just because i can accept that we are not meant for eachother does not mean i do not miss him intensely
i loved you so much that i forgave you for all these times you talked to me in that way but i was also not brave enough to speak up and tell you were hurting me and that is lesson learned on my part
it was great but after it was over i felt really guiltyi was told to refer to it as singles awareness day but that makes it worse
often whenever i would walk in the school halls alone a group of my male peers would spank me and make comments about my posterior
but i can not become dependent on him i just want to never wake up i have work in 6 hours and i still have not fell asleep
i do not get it why can not she leave me alone does not she get the clue that i do not want anything to do with her i have gotten rid of all my social media just so i do not see hers or see something that reminds me of her
it was a major rewrite of the narrative of my life but i think that i learned a lot coming through the other side i grew as a person
i felt like i found my path and that i was changing as a person because of it when i looked at him it seemed like he was the same person he was when he was 22
the people i reached out to are selfish idiots whom i helped and was there for them people for whom i cooked dinners and invited to the parties and poetry events i organised few years ago
i loved it when i was a kid i had birthday parties when i was a kid and had a lot of friends and people come
and when there is no real becausei have been lonely for as long as i can remember1 i do not socialise much mainly because i do not drink
and my gf broke up with me and she blocked me everywhere and told me not to look for her anymore and to live on
but then i also wonder if this is even worth my time despite the feelings i have for him i know i am worth more but want to give him a chance
right now i know something is wrong i can tell i care but at the same time not really it is just that i know this is not me and i want to fix it almost like when you see something that is not color coded you want to fix it but if you do not whatever no biggie i wrote about the actual headache in a post from the other day if you want more context
like trying to date again stopping probably led me to delve deeper into mmo games i am alone in another country i know i am not love of his live or even most important
so that when the time comes and you move on you would at least left all those tears behind and not keeping them in your pocket to cry all over them again
i was confused as to why he was not comforting me and when i tried to talk about my feelings again he avoided it and changed the subject many times
and what is the point of life is it just to suffer numerous answers that people have given me run through my mind daily to be happy to loveto be with whom you love to learn etc but is that really the point of life
i do not feel like i can walk on anymore but i keep going but i like to think about philosophy and what we as people think about and feel in times of the worst moments and everyday i feel like we all walk on just because of family because of significant others because of friends sometimes those are the reasons for our worst moments
i am usually the quiet one just looking around a bystander pretty much i do not really enjoy much of it i do not feel like i belong but it keeps out thoughts that i hate
he would shame me for my sexual history withhold affection because of his jealousy then coldly tell me what was wrong bring it up during our own sexual encounters which was humiliating inferred that i was pathetic for not just saying no to the coerced encounters he compared me to his friends who had virgin girlfriends and say they had it easier than him he asked me horrible questions about my past encounters
sorry if this post is really dumb lolthis year has just been absolutely terrible started with me getting out of a todic relationship
living with chronic pain and illness that have only gotten worse have made me extremely depressive and i can not live this life much longer
a part of their help includes doing prayers and speaking to god and so on and other scientific things to help with my situation
but i was just wondering about peoples opinions on leaving notes the thought of writing them causes me even more pain but the thought of my loved ones being in pain also destroys me
do not say anything that you believe will harm that person for example get over it just have a laugh you are boring this will hurt the person deeply and they will remember it for a very long time they will not take it as a joke they will take it personally
we were even really so afraid that it would not have worked again and it is really really really unfortunate it actually ended like that again
back in august my boyfriend of 5 years and i decided to end our relationship before i started my senior year of college we decided that we wanted different things we still love each other and we would get back together if we knew things would be different but that is not promised
now i just smile so that i do not come across as boring cuz otherwise there is nothing to be happy about maybe i am overreacting maybe i am just craving for attention
i knew i have been depressed for too long and i decided to make it my year and improve but i lost my grandmother in the first week went on to lose my job in march due to covid and i remained at home from march till july in july i found a new job but i lost that in september again due to covid
she is an emotional terrorist who demanded emotional maturity and had no intention of returning it fuck him i tried to kill myself a few times including last week
i know they are not our safest memories they are still intact and very much alivethey are everywhere bedroom kitchen that restaurant this car that beach
my entire life it has consumed me my ex wife taught me a lot about the things i would never put up with again
so i am asking for advice on this how can i changecan i change am i just a terrible person on the inside i do not know but i want to change if you have read this please give me the criticism in your own word do not sugar coat it if you do not need to
funnily enough i felt he was more into me at first than i was into him how the tables have turned
i have tried to be tough and self sufficient my whole life but i always end up slipping back to a place of fear
their wives do not want them hanging with me specifically because i have no family of my own this is totally understandable
i will always love you and have space in my heart for you if you ever need anything in life just let me know i will be there for you
we can easily get swallowed by love so the solution is to put other healthy values on top of it those are values like loyalty respect humility honesty or trust in other words we should not take love so damn seriously build unrealistic outlooks and expectations around it or sacrifice ourselves
yeah i should not have talked to you and then block you after a week out of the blue but you always seem to forget why we are broken up in first place
i have mocks in 2 weeks which might have to count towards my final ucas score i have no motivation to revise it kind of seems pointless now i have lost my sense of taste and smell from having covid which has made me not often get hungry so i forget to eat and to be honest do not really care anymore
this is all strange to me and i do not know what to do i just thought he should know about it
we had each others backs but it is like the switch flipped too much and now i can not truly feel sad at all
i really do appreciate everything people do for me i appreciate my family and my friends everyone who was there for me and with me
edit tldr emotionally my ex was erratic and her most commonly expressed emotion was anger i think a lot of this came from things that happened to her growing up she would even cycle from raging to in love to upset again within an hour sometimes and i just do not understand where she is coming from any perspective would help
i never looking by side when crossing the road i just know when i am walk noone rides but here is alot of besides hes somehy ignoring my friends shit
the you who would make me feel loved like no one else was around the good was too good also i have a hard time focusing on things now
like she talks about her friends who none of us know but as if we would know them she also will just come up to us and talk
i lost my baby back in may due to condition i had while i was pregnant and it broke me and my partner apart
i am just so sad i thought we were unbreakable either way in my heart i want her to be happy and for their life together to work out
it is been almost 10 months since we fell out thing is i have have been holding on for even about about 7 months after we fell out
my family life is stable now but my education is not going as planned and in january this year i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes
here to vent i live alone now but not because i want to my mom and my brother went off to take care of my grandpa in another country before the quarantine struck because of college i was not able to go with them but now i am back and i miss them very much i have never felt this prolonged silence before who knows how long thisll last but i can only hope
this entire year has pretty much been spent in my bedroom around my house save for some shopping trips the only other person i have spoken to much apart from my mum is my dentist
i have not made any plans on how to do it yet but i just wanted to tell someone it is so fucked up life has lead me to this but here i am i wish i did not have to die but there has never been any other choices for me besides how i will one day end myself
do not post sad quotes or songs on your socials you look like a fool post what you posted before and most likely they will come across it seeing you thriving
people are going to comment saying do this or stop doing this or try doing this but my brain is a shitshow
i did not see the amazing things you say and did for me i did not allow you to be part of the process of our relationship
every day i keep choosing to live but every day feels like just more of the bullshit i rarely break even in the amount of suffering even less to the point of having good days
i have recently been thinking about just sending them a text to express my gratitude and appreciation it makes us depressed gives us intrusive thoughts and increases anxiety the jokes on me
a brief backstory first i have been dating this girl for about a year nowin january we work together and have lots of mutual friends we started off as close friends nothing sexual and fast forward a few months we both developed feelings for each other i found her truly attractive and she found me funny we started dating
about a month or two back my medications started to work and for the first time since i could remember i felt happy to be alive
nowadays i do not have friends at all and the things i used to be passionate about just do not feel the same
i am just really struggling and would love to hear anything from anyonebruh do not contact your ex if you are no contact
because it is not easy for me it feels like everything is wrong and i thought then that that is it this year will be all about me and oh god it was
i told her to contact me if she felt suicidal because even though she left me when i became chronically sick and thought i was dying
i look back and just see pain i have attempted so many times that i can not even count on both my hands
i see him in the halls at school and we just act like strangers i can not reach out because it is not my place
we are on friendly terms now after a very messy breakup one that i caused but definitely have suffered the most from but after moving back in with my family for a few months being back there with her for an afternoon in the city that we lived for several years was really really emotional
i then made a very honest attempt to be 100 open and put everything on the table with her this was insanely difficult and scary for me
it is just that these are not regular things they are planned well in advance now there is just noone i can reach out to
if you blame yourself right now for what you have done wrong in the past or recently that you could not let it go or even forgive yourself because you feel it is your fault this post might be a helpful thing for you to know
i need some advise on getting over a person long distance i was dating them for 5 months and we were both extremely into each other except they lived in an abusive house hold
i have really loved them with all my heart so i feel like i am not good enough even though i really tried
i do not think now our relationship will be the same again how can i make this work i do not have a clue
but toward the end he had told me that he stopped loving me somewhere along the line and it was over
this is why i want to find closure in the same way everything began with a letter from gis your groupies in socks
making the choice to sacrifice his time to be late even if it meant listening to my frequent breakdowns of feeling unable to cope he was the first man i felt i could truly sink into his arms and feel weak
but it is getting tiring since i was 14 i have been showing my body online for attention and recognition to cope with it i have gotten used to getting praise this way it is almost as if i do not know what an actualy friendship is like anymore
i went into high school ambitious expecting to work hard find my high school sweetheart and go to mit instead i slept in every class lost motivation to do anything and am going to my state university is it normal for 17 year old guys to just want to skip to the part where they might get married and have kids
so the reason that i love listening to gamegrumps super mega and oneyplays is that i feel like i am with them i know it is werid but in my head i am like that is so funny it is something i have always wanted was just to hang with the bros and play games
this is a minor post compared to a lot on here so if you do not have much time spend it on the ones more in need
if we focused on ourselves for a bit it made me realize something very important i can not be friends with her
she loved him her friends were frustrated that i ruined it so i give up some people are not meant to be with someone
i can not save money i keep sucking money from my parents i am addicted to every drug i try i make my friends hate me i do things i instantly regret and never learn i am just a waste of a human
i need help conversing normally with peoplecoworkers i feel so awkward half of the time and sometimes i have no clue how to respond to what they say and stare at them like i am an idiot
every year during christmas and new year i just end up feeling low and lonely we are not allowed to go out on new years eve my parents do not like partying and have put restrictions on us i suffer from anxiety and depression
not all not always i do not really mean to berate any of these people or even the industry as a whole it is not their fault it is a new industry and it needs time to properly mature actually i am glad and grateful they are there
last monday i broke up with my girlfriend of just over a year it was because i did not feel 100 in the relationship for a few weeks before and simply could not shake the thoughts
and this time i was friends with her and the rest of the group for 2 semesters 1 year i thought finally i made friends i was so happy
the fights between everyone made it hard to bear and the constant talk of who died today how and other depressing topics
living at home currently in order to save money for when i pursue a doctoral degree or a jd 23 years in future there really is not a way to move out during the pandemic nor is it cost effective family is extremely toxic parents marriage is really for show at this point constant yelling and fighting between my siblings and parents i can not describe adequately how bad the familial situation is
question for you all can adhd because people to want to kill themselves my friend for the last year has had suicidal thoughts and she believes it is caused by adhd and something called emotional dysregulation
a few days later tho i did not hear anything back from him at alli am not sure how reddit works so i hope i am doing this right but anyways
his ex tried to get back with him but he refused i think he did that bc of how toxic their relationship was but despite all that he loved her and probably still does but he will not admit it to me at the beginning of the relationship he blocked her bc i asked him to but he secretly unblocked her and actually communicated with her behind i back
i wish i could go back and take hormone therapy since puberty started because i know my body would not have grown this fucking tall i would not have facial hair an adams apple or any secondary sex characteristics i fucking hate myself for allowing myself to go through make puberty
i know that many people are far worse off than me and that it is a silly thing to hurt for but the pain still lingers
i have been contemplating suicide ever since my great grandfather died i have attempted 4 times in the past month my motivation is completely gone and my friends leaving me has not made this any better i want to do it but i am scared of what lies after the world goes black someone please give me some motivation or something
so basically i was still paying the rent of some girl who did not love me for an entire year and once she was done with me after xmas she would move on to her secret man after she was done using me
what am i missing the question that keeps me up all the time how with these relationships and people everything material i need and want am i still not happy inside i do not know but i want to know i want to be able to fix it because i hate being this way
recently been disowned from one parent he could not cope with my mental health and my mother going to hospital the night before christmas for an apparent heart disease
we started talking and our chemistry was instant it felt like we knew each other our hearts reached out without words and our minds felt made for one another
she knew damn well that there was nobody else in school i could turn to and she still threw me away as soon as i was not a necessary tool anymore
my heart is broken and it is probably related with this sometimes i wish i did not have testicles sex has never been good for me it is hell
all my life has been hard but this time it is on me and hurts unbelievably bad and if she leaves or i wake upand she is goneall i will be tempted to do is drink
sometimes i find myself in this situation and i realize i am doing it because i am lonely i do not like her because to me she is not a genuine person
the same sort of thing happens when it comes to the dating scene i will meet a nice girl and then run her off because of my strange bondforming behavior
that one hurts the most because i want to be there for you to take the pain away but i know he needs this time a space for his mental health
i wanted marriage and you said no i wanted to start a life and you wanted to be a free man
like the thought of another day is waaay too bear i guess i am writing this cuz i absolutely have no idea wtf to do next
my family was not the only trigger that put me in this kind of a position but they have been a pretty consistent trigger throughout my life
i also searched for help and in 2021 i will receive trauma therapy i do not trust anyone anymore because so many people knew about his relationship and lied to me i feel very lonely yet when i am with my ex i feel happy again
i ate one tiny brownie and it made me want to kill myself there is another reason holidays are hell any advice on if i should change my approach or keep doing what i am doing
3 i am already miserable enough and am incredibly depressed and it is not like it is going to get better it only gets worse even on christmas there is so much negativity because well i am making this post on christmas
i am so stupid that i had to drop out of college so no one wants to hire me since i do not have a degree
i am happy too i guess maybe i do not know because i do not feel different i suppose that makes it official i am deadhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvr12o9mn8qs4 inside
everytime he speaks with me nicer and is just generally kind i remember one time he cooked pasta with my brother and i was playing a game
i am fine with solitude and being alone but its the loneliness that is killing mehbut it is been 2 days now and it was only two drinks
i just want to feel like someone actually cares who knows how soon i will die given my new chronic illness
our relationship was great in general but there was about a 3 4 month period after our first year and a half where i was finding him sexting other girls that he was with physically before me
well she broke up with me saying that she loves me so much that i am a super nice and incredibly caring person and we probably could have been a good couple but that my inexperience is hurting the chemistry she said it makes her feel insecureuncomfortablestressed and she does not want to put in the time to hold my hand and walk me through this
in fact we started out long distance since i was on the east coast and she was in ca it was blissful and fun despite the distance i
i will not ask if we could still stay friends i think i will plan to stay out of her life now or have very minimal interactions even though just last night i was telling her the exact opposite that i did not want to leave her life that i will save our relationshipbut i already understood that it will be mostly useless and move on even if her relationship with that guy would not be great or last long
deep down i know i was just a rebound to him and when i would asked him he said i was not and he was genuinely interested in me at the beginning
my girlfriend is truly wonderful but she has an obsession with a kpop group and has a twitter fan account for her favorite group members
wondering how many of us were misdiagnosed and the va just said ptsd as a catch all i do have the flashbacks and what not but that is not the worst of it
i actually stopped crying about it now i just feel empty and calm about it its weird this is not the first time this has happened and was wondering if anyone else has experienced this
anyways a couple weeks ago i am living with him knowing he is talking to other women as a quarantine social outlet just asking him to declare what we werepay me back for my furniture bc it was never my taste and he also had a german cockroach infestation not roid
ok so sometimes i pretend i am the main character of an old french movie from the 1960s like something really melancholic and pensive and there is a narrator and i am being watched by an imaginary audience watching the movie that i happen to be the main character of
my girlfriend and i broke up about two months ago and it was mutual and we both decided to remain friends
i have my mom and my therapist work is nice and it is honestly the only thing keeping me from tumbling into the dreaded depression hole i have a few things to look forward to a week every couple months where i get to see an old friend but those weeks in between where all i know is the laundromat the dispensary and these four goddam walls are fucking terrible
i thought i had learnt my lesson and finally had it made saw all those sad relationship quotes that i used to relate to and would flick my hair like that are not me i was ready to marry this guy 6 months in
i am now the person i always wanted to be with her but she went away without even asking me for any changes or complaining or trying something out it was a 3 year relationship the longest i have ever had and the only one where i lived together with a gf
like seeing somebody get held hostage or someone getting shot in the head and she told me she hears voices a lot too
i am doing it in the bathtub so the mess is not too bad i have wrote four notes and placed them on the bathroom counter
just wanted to get this off my chest i do not want to tell my friends this do not really want to burden them with all my emotional shit so it is a good thing reddits here
sorry this is pointless post but i needed to share my feelings with someone hope some day we all will be happy sorry for shit english
hi i am a 26yearold man and i want to own a gun the neighborhood where i live is not safe at all and i want a gun to just give me that little bit of safety and put my mind at ease when walking to and from work
changed i made instagram and i was posting pictures of me online for the first timemet her in april and we started dating for about a month she was all over me
but do not give up just yet because there is light at the end of the tunnelfirst time posting mainly just needed to rant about some things my boyfriend 28 of 1
for no reason i am a coward who is afraid if pain and the aftermath reaction from my family i do not think i have depression or any stress based on some random internet questioners
my best friend for over 10 years and i got into an argument over a misunderstanding and now she is all but blocked me
there is an absence in the shape of a person keeping me company tonight it is a ghost that haunts me regularly at this hour of night sometimes this ghost is kind and allows me to feel warmth and self love other nights it absorbs my joy and instead replaces it with depression and selfdoubt
have been raised by a loving family married into a loving family wife loves me have half a dozen close friends
my gut tells me he was supposed to be the one for me he was my protectordo i have to block him or talk to him because he is also alone in this town
i stayed in bed until 1 pm because of depression and then i mustered up all my energy to get out my room
my parents could not afford any other architecture college by any other i mean private ones asked me to join the university that sent me the mail
from myself i wish you a very merry christmas and i hope you all have a terrific day spend is with the people you love and cherish each moment if you are in need of someone to talk to my pms will be open throughout the whole day just pop me a message and i will get back at you
we were friends and i hope to see her again it was a tough relationship to get out of but i managed to leave
like it almost hurts me to do so and not just walk away a persons lives just round about 90 years it is nothing compared to the univers
i am in very dark place right now and feel like i am going to snap any moment now is there anyone willing to chat
today marks a year since the last relationship which was toxic all around that should be enough i did not choose life
to which degree do i make them worse i have no clue but i make the situation more unbearable seemingly on purpose through my actions
my very simple solution to that was to just do things that make me happy and get this all over with
in october and november we were having sex once or twice a week but it was literally just sex for him like he would have such short answers if i asked about work or his family
ok so this is a lot and its pretty heavy but i need to vent because i can not talk to the people in my life about it
these are not like dreams where we just have sex it is literally just me spending time with this person and every time i wake up from one of these dreams i just feel awful
i want to use this time to graduate university and focus on my personal growth but in my heart i do not feel like i lost him forever it was just the wrong time in the notsonear future i want to try again because in my gut he was my soulmate my other half of the puzzle
i feel like i will never get my selfesteem back and i am so worried that after i die she will expose me
a large part of it is romantic and sexual loneliness but a big part is that even though i have close friends i do not lean on them much when i am feeling really bad
whenever you all take a pictures assuming it is a group you imagine your ex taking pictures with other people having fun with them not thinking about you at all
because of this he made a lot of enemies at his work they made a plot to ruin his life and sent anti corruption squad to raid our home
i have no idea how to stop this i like them i know they like me but i can not put up with it any more
he is been wanting to do this for a while regardless but his drive is exacerbated by this situation my instincts tell me i do not want to go
my girlfriend broke up with me last night it is so fresh and it hurts so bad i do not want to hurt you like jfc no one stays in my life
one day you will find the gift that keeps on givingi only write this with true and honest feelings because i felt it still am
but now i think she is avoiding me too and i am going to be alone again i am sure i am going to rot alone
what do i have to look forward to my thirties will go the same another decade of misery my forties same but i will just be one of those bitter loner adults
i came home and did some meditation and then made some homemade soup for my lunch i did some work and completed my checklist
i cooked and bought cake but all he did was drink and play videogames we did not eat that night so i accepted it and left her alone she really ended it this time
i am heartbroken and she seems unbothered everyone wants me to do better i want me to do better i had dreams of playing in concerts
we met up and went out for the night yesterday to speak things over while we ate she seemed so genuine but only her words spoke her actions said nothing she would not hug me or kiss me but i had not realized until today
she did not have any children she used to point to the moon and tell me stories every night while feeding me
2 two 15 minute booster sessions to followup after your session i want to kill myself i say that with no sense of the consequences
at 18 i was finally doing better i started going to the gym and therapy during the relationship we had an amazing sex life
it is been a week since we broke up but we can not stop texting and talking to each other we facetimed for the first time last night and it was nice to talk to him but it brought up old stuff and i am not feeling well going to try to go a week no contact might die help pls
talking to my friends i think i am going to wait at most a month and if nothing changes then i will have a talk with her about these feelings because i feel like i am just trapped and waiting
i am thankful for the memories to have someone share some parts of my life to keep my companyi think about how you are doing everyday still check my phone for messages that are not there
i fucking need a way to kill myself do not fucking try to help me i do not fucking need help just fucking tell me a way
i had refused sex saying maybe later but i bought her things for the time being is this normal or am i even more unhinged than i already thought i was
just like my sister he asked me to be open about my problems so that i do not have to go through the pain alone
this lockdown is really killing me on the inside i have tried to end my life multiple times but it never works out
i am mad that we are not watching christmas movies together right now so many things i would rather be doing and yet i am angry
eventually after summer everything went back to normal with our group of friends the people who were angry forgave me and her friend and we started hanging out again
nowadays toxicity in friendships where friends or people in general will be toxic towards eachother without malicious intent and is not be be taken seriously is becoming normalized nowadays
weeks after we met once shortly and i could literally feel how drained he was it was a ridiculous and absurd reality to face i would finish a giant fucking project
i can not have a romantic relationship again no matter how hard i try being a retail grunt is not sexually attractive
i have struggled with depression and anxiety for a long time had a short relationship with first gf ever and broke up recently since then she has been feeling me to kill myself and all sorts of horrible stuff
this has been happening at least once every 2 weeks not bad enough to go inpatient and i do not want to go iop because they are all online
i wish i could time travel to 2 weeks ago before everything became so messed up and you were still here with me
tldr my ex fiance and i broke up a month ago and he recently just threw all of my perceived flaws in my face and now i feel like garbage
my animal crossing villagers threw me a birthday party today i have never had a birthday party before there was cake and everything they gave me presents too it felt pretty real to me even though it is a just a videogame it was fun while it lasted
i have heard that stuff about people who survived jumping off the golden gate bridge saying right after they jumped they realized all their problems were solvable and they should not have jumped but for me that was not really the case
am i supposed to believe that motivating others is my only purpose in life and that there is nothing for me for my own good
so what is the physiological action of lowered serotonin such that it leads to these symptomsi will just start it like this i am an extreme hypochondriac and i have stress and anxiety induced seizures
cheats lies abusesemotionally or physically and betrays you my parents do not drink or do anything also everyone in my household is vegetarian
my second crush i have had who i was out too literally accused me of assaulting him and he even apologized after because he lied about it he threatened to beat me and i still could not fucking get out of the relationship because i just wanted to be validated
after all of this time i realized that i do not dislike you i do not feel indifferent about you and i do not hate you that is what makes this so hard
it makes therapy kind of difficult i tell my therapist all my issues and she says it is irrational and distorted thinking i know i tell her about my paranoid thoughts and she says it does not make sense i know
my worries mostly come in the form of religious worrying but when i was in japan even though i was depressed i still had fun playing video games etc
fucking please do not spread your mean ass damn disease known as harass till i collapse from all of the fucking hees
at this point she is still with her girlfriend i am a dude btw ever since then i have been utterly lonely i have not gone outdespite current situations in so long
i have caused so much pain and grief in my life and my family has suffered directly from thisnow i know most of you feel lie it is a fairytalei guess you will know it when you feel it
so my best friend sent this a couple days ago and it really upset me once i saw it because she and i recently discussed my mental health i was telling her a little bit about what goes on in my head her sending this made me feel worse
i 24f met a guy 29m in march right as covid hit we met the next day i stayed the night and never really ended up leaving
she spreads the word out to everyone she talks to for like 2 days but i am done worrying about her that is a little easier said than done
and i told her that i feel suicidal and that i might kms and she just acted like she did not care
take 3 deep breaths in through the nose until your chest is full then slowly exhale out through your mouth after doing that 3 times shift to breathing at your usual pace while still inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth

it would be nicer if someone lived my life for me but have to remember no one sees my thoughts or my past or all my hoard of bachelor organized junk
my head is on crooked and i can not seem to think straight i am broken i have changed i am not who i was yesterday i hate what i have become
you knew i have bpd i am a bit shy but i like to talk to people i have many interests and hobbies
i feel like i have no right to live there is millions of combinations and permutations involved in the creation of a human and i just had to be made
i do not want to get my hopes up but it is inevitable to hope we can go back to something more or at least that i can still kiss her
if you live with someone who is experiencing mental illness do not expect them to magically appear happy if they open your gift and do not seem too pleased that does not mean they are unhappy they are mentally drained tired and deflated inside they are incredibly grateful and may also share a tear inside of their own head if they do not look the part it does not mean they are not grateful
i am scared of me so what is the point of life if i am always scared i do not think there is one
virgin men are too weird and unsettling for moderates and at the same time promiscuous women are too undignifying for them
somehow every little thing turned into why do not you love me i suspect because of the abandonment but i never expected to be the guiding light in the relationship as the partner with bipolar but here we are
the constant pursuit of success has also made me overtly competitive a bit narcissistic and i just look down upon on people who did not work as hard as me
i should not have given my heart to you you had so many red flags but i did and i loved you with everything i had i am trying to erase all the ideas of plans we had together and create a new future without you
i do not know what to do i would like to have someone to go to i am alone and i have no one to seek refuge in i had been able to keep it away but it has caught up with me again this feeling of
i have only ever been heartbroken once in my life it is not to say i have not had partners before but this is the first time i genuinely loved someone and it was the worst fucking pain i have ever experienced you hurt so much because you realize that you lost more than just them but a friend and what felt like a soulmate
but what i needed to rant about what i needed to say was this i told him the truth not gory details but my plain simple truth and i told him that if that is not cool with him then he should end it i told him this multiple times because i did not want it to blow up in my face
she said it was hard for her to wait for me and that just texting is not enough for heri have an exroommatefriend who has suffered in the past from depressionanxiety
i always pictured my ex as a perfect being it continued to be like this for 5 months 5 months of pure depression and suicidal thoughts
she said yes i was happy for fucking once in my miserable existence i was happy then only 10 months later what felt like i was stabbed by a blunt one handed broad sword by some prick who decides fate my grand father dies he stayed around while i was in that god damn hospital i was in there for 12 fucking hours after i had the call he was there
i have had 5 deployments to some not so great places and i am not sure if that is a part of the reason
i have really starting detaching growing and maturing with the situation my anxiety over it all has pretty much gone or been overcome
fast forward one more time and i am in an art college a king amongst crackheads the neighborhood notquitemombutverysupportivevodkaaunt friend in my ideal environment but still very much in the dregs of loneliness i wondered how that could be and have come to realize things that nobody ever seems to acknowledge but have proven to be the most important in helping me understand the nature of loneliness for myself and others
even though there are not signs that i was physically harmed it makes me sick to my stomach that this could have happened
we had a wishy washy relationship for 7 months and he 27m just broke up with me last week for no reason except he just could not love me
it is deeply one of the biggest regrets i will ever hold onto i know what abandonment feels like and i swore i would never abandon my children
i felt violated by them continuing to touch me i felt like i could not leave and i just wanted everything to be over i was never attracted to any of them and i did not want to do anything with them
now why tf did i say that i do not even know what i meant by that i want to be so succesfull but i do not even want to get up from my bed
if anyone else does feel this way i really am sorry that you have to live through this the world really does suck
even if things get better it is all temporary in the end everyone leaves me and i am the only one feeling hurt
i got pregnant with my pedo stepdads kid i caught covid19today my depression is at his worse i am full of insecurities hate myself and sometimes just want to die
after 2 weeks of not talking to him he texts me 3 times 2 days ago to check up on me
it has been 11 years since i had a gf or even kissed someone i can not even remember how that feels or even a loving hug or having someone is attention
i have sent him a lovely text and said that i need this time and we can speak next monday but my mind is racing and i am so unsure about what happens next
i live for my parents and friends because i do not want to because them pain but that answer is not good enough to be really honest
all those years wasted in the common area everyone just trying to keep me calm but no i have now been diagnosed with depression and agoraphobia and panic disorder
i just want to be my best self and i want the same for my ex but right now they are hurting very badly and i just want to take that pain away by saying i made a mistake
the problem is that i love them so much that i think the best for them is to be far from me no one deserves to be next to a failure like me
it is addicting for some but if you can be responsible and not over do it i recommend taking some and just letting tears roll while eating comfort food nothing will heal it quickly but that is part of life
i will try to keep it short i had stress with everything a friend who i prevented from killing herself by sending a full squad of police people to pick her up from the train she was in 1000 deadlines at the education i am in at home fighting with my mother who did not care about anything but herself and to top it all of i could not get sleep because of my lovely screaming ape like sounding neighbours who decided when i was allowed to go sleep mostly around 13 am yay i needed to get up for schcool at 6 of the clock
yet i always end up pushing people away by showing them a very morbid picture of my life its not even the drugs that raises their red flags
i ended up in the hospital for a month today is his birthday too this realisation just made me so lost and defeated
i guess my main question is what can i do about this how do i stop being so sensitive and blowing things out of proportion in my head and feeling these ways about simple constructive criticism
i live in germany and do not know how to find a good psychiatrist so if anyone of you got a number or website or whatever that helps i would love to see it or also any advise whatsoever i really really need help
i have been crying myself to sleep almost every night and have absolutely no motivation to get up for work or do anything that i enjoy
i did not cry since i was 8 yo tough childhood whole different story but that day i could not stop i tried to hug her but she did not hug me back i asked if i could do anything for her but she said she just wanted to sleep
like about 2 years ago i started skipping school for no reason and lied to my mom about grades and bullying even faked tears
she will be able to grieve and then hopefully move on with her life she will not be ridden with anxiety everyday wondering if i am safe
every year we get even more broke now at this point any ablebodied nonmentally ill person would get up and get a job
my ex and i have for the most part been no contact but have spoken 3 times once initiated by him and twice by me what does that mean on our parts i know it is affecting our healing but he is crossed boundaries and the line even before than and now that i have i feel weird
this is the first time i ever experience something like this as in only 20 i am just feeling so damn lonely
day after he breaks up with me while sobbing saying he does not know if he is making the worst decision of his life by leaving his soulmate i meet him again hours later for dinner he is a completely different person
i mean i have good days sometimes but i always get put back down quicklyits been about 2 month now since the breakup
i know it is beating a dead horse and everyone is been through this it just sucks to go through this in the current moment
i do not eat any vegetables or fruit and i never eat infront of people because i am afraid they will judge my diet
i try to shake it off by making myself busy trying something new watching tv scrolling social media for pics of kittenspuppies etc
i am sorry to the girl i loved for not being a good enough person once i am able to get a gun i will most likely be gone
i am fed up of explaining to him whenever i do he abuses me telling i am so insensitive and my mom always supports him and tries to justify whatever he is doing
i even agreed to an open relationship but it turns out i can not deal with that option same as my 18th birthday same as all the fucking birthdays
it might be because of the fact that i know that there is sick some pieces of shits out there that are even worse than i was that they defend that braindead neanderthal rapist war machine and say that she got what she deserved
he said that he liked me and i liked him back a lot he said he had a crush on me and i felt so good we watched a movie and held hands it was not a grand date but i was just happy to spend time with him
6 society is going to shit anyways and at this rate i would rather die on my own terms than deal with a rushed vaccine and commit social suicide which i have probably already half committed at the rate i am going
and now i have picked at it to the point it hurts besides health obsessions like that issues like academics because me a great deal of stress
the porn had stalled our sex life and she felt i was uninterested or found her unattractive i told her about my porn addiction early on in the relationship
so after i broke up he immediately asked about arrangements to get my stuff back and acted kind of pissy with me
but sadly it did not work for long because the pure rush of being able to do any type of task without having this feeling paired to it was amazing for some reason i saw great results very quickly which made me start doing all the things that i usually mess up for hours
i am forced to be around people i do not want to be around my job my co employees customersi am forced to be happy around people or places i do not want to be around
she was in a relationship with someone whom she did not even know well i told the girl she should start sitting with my friends and me because we had more fun
well recently made a friend did not feel lonely and he brought out the best in me i would be lying if i said i did not love him
i dropped out of college i quit my job because i hate dealing with customers i have been staying at home for a year now only gone out to buy food and that is it
become so much better that they are going to miss your presenceno guys delete these things from your brain these are toxic intentions to have when trying to recover
my first week like hell my heart was broken i could not sleep could not ate anything i scared to go out i slept all day i quitted my job after 1 week i realized many thing and learnt my own lesson
i can not connect with anyone or anything the connections i used to feel with my family feel diminished i am no longer capable of being a good friend i am worthless and a burden
i am not useful i am not skilled in any way i am not special i am replaceable i am disposable i am just dirt i am trash i am just taking up space
i had finally found someone who was exactly my type and my past ventures in love were soon forgotten never dated anyone per say but had my fair share of mutual liking
i just want to be alone completely alone but my friends get upset at me for not wanting to interact or for deleting my social media saying that i should not have to isolate myself
secondly do not subscribe to the belief that you are totally awesome and deserving of every feelgood thing person or experience you wish for
i promise that i did i called i textedone of my friends facing some sort of difficulty with choosing the best memories in any category
i hate say it even after all the efforts one day you just become another chapter in the past a fading memory a person you do not think of every day
i am simultaneously so frustrated by how much fear i feel and so terrified 80 of the timeso what is the fucking point
when my dad finally left the military they had my sister and i became a background character in my own life

the truth of the matter is that i am fucking scared i love him so much i do not want to ever be with someone else
in the most general definition that i can think of a toxic person is anyone who causes drama in a relationships
my friend who i met online has parents who are a because of her depression and numerous suicide thoughts now i finally get things together finally i have a goal in my life and enthusiasm to self learn
i regretted that decision every day i was with my new gf it is deeply one of the biggest regrets i will ever hold onto
she also wants to move out as soon as possible as she does not feel comfortable she gets random criticisms and feels a bit stressed in the flatshare
this is hard like really hard just keep going and pushing yourself but remember the why and ask yourself if you feel down
nothing is wrong in the moment but often i forget to be happy and i just think about who died when and how and why and start knocking on wood that it does not happen to me or my family
she is a good therapist i was able to tell her why i did not go back to her after our apartment in october she was able to start working me through my trauma she listened to me she understood me and wow it feels amazing
i am going through a break up he or she left mei was completely immersed in that relationship that i lost myself in that relationship

i poured so much love into every single thing i drew for you from day one of our relationship i spent hours awake past midnight worrying about you or lusting over you
i have been more or less isolated for 13 years i am 24 now i have had a few friendships but after a while people can not stand me
i am just so so sad it is been more than a month now and i still feel absolutely heartbroken and cry a lot
this sounds so dramatic but it is really how i am feeling and i just needed to get it out ig i am struggling with the break up
so i keep making new accounts to continue the conversation the only thing she does is judging me telling me to stop contacting and so on
things changed when i went to college i started loosing my school friends with them now having newer friends i did not make any good friends in college and i never had a girlfriend
i do not understand jack shit in school but at least these greedy bastards have their money so all my progress is in vain this situation has fucking destroyed me
i am covered in blood i do not know why i do thisas a teenager i was a lot bullied especially on school
i do not expect her to be depressed 247 but this seems a little fishy to meafter we broke up he wanted to keep me in his life
they act like getting help is something that is out of this world i tell them my problems and they are that is normal
just get somewhere where you will not be disturbed and set your timer either a phone or a clock for about 10 to 20 minutes and follow these steps
recently i have lost the motivation to be here lost the motivation to carry on to keep living i think i need to see a physiatrist because i have lost hope in the doctors helping me at all
then i got the idea of making an account on sole social media because i am lonely and i might as well talk to someone online it worked for a bit it felt like everyone already had their own group of friends and no one really reached out to me so i became less active
i legit have no future i do not understand jack shit in school i still have some of her things at my house and she also has some of mine
on sunday afternoon i asked if we are still on for tonight and how i understand how hard it is for him that i do not really want to push him but that i think he needs to get out of the house
i would have sat near your death bed if you were dying alone but now i just hope we never cross paths
having a mental impairment was hard enough now i am trying to manage an every day persistent physical side effect from this medication
finally gathered the courage to get out of the relationship i held onto for 8 years last week i do not feel anything and it made me feel bad
my parents live in germany and i go to visit them every 6 months and spend 3 months there with them
i could tell he did not want to be in a relationship i think he just did not want to hurt me with a break up but honestly i think prolonging it made it a bit worse
it hurt my trust so much and i hated seeing him the way he was i told him he truly needed to get help
it is like once i tried to stop thinking about the past so much i became incapable of feeling anything from prior to just a few days
i have no passions nor things i want to do nothing interests me nowadays i do not want to explore anything about this world i honestly do not care about the things i do not know
we keep progressing slowly and in some ways it felt better than ever there was no more suspicions no more secrets we could be completely free and open with one another
but on yesterday for some reason i shook my head violently i was extremely mad at myself i had a concussion about 2 months ago and i have a bad headache and nausea today may not be far off to assume i have another concussion
so i end up ghosting them even tho i do care for them and like themwhy am i like this like what is wrong with me my loneliness is my fault
my mental health has deteriorated to the point where i am actively seeking suicide i am under so much stress that my body feels like it is collapsing daily due to the return of covid symptoms
i had internal bleeding and got emergency surgery which has now left me with a permanent scar both physically and mentally
i was in denial for a long time and it was not healthy and when i got out of denial it did not go well
appreciation like that only comes my way when i am part of a bigger group for example a team when she said that to me i got so happy i jumped and danced around my room
they do help you from time to time but only on their own terms if there is a time when i have needed their help they would not extend that helping hand or they would do so reluctantly counting the number of favors i would owe them
if you do feel lonely or just want to chat dm me i would love to talk to people who are on the same boat as me
you can not force feelings but it is just when i met my ex from that moment it was sparks and i knew i liked him
she is my everything i love her so fucking much she is been through a lot her whole life and things just keep piling up
but when it comes to that aspect of life i am terrifiedi am in college right now and i made a couple of friends who i thought would stick
i said and did things that i should not have small andor big things even if they seemed easily or less forgivable
maybe you valued loyalty and honesty and your ex did not maybe you wanted kids and they did not i just wish i can have people by me who are working or studying
my teachers at school keep laying the workload on i am failing most my courses and am looking set for a terrible future i can not turn to my parents as their views on mental health issues will only worsen the issue i do not want to dump this on my friends as i am too nervous i have developed insomnia over the course of this year i can not sleep most nights i mean it is 523 am here and i have not slept i have tried but i could not
once in a while he will go on a real date with someone around his age that he met from match but it never goes beyond a first date
it feels demoralizing to want to keep dating because i feel like i am already on a gradual decline i am okay with the notion of not being in a relationship but i have also got this idea that it is not a matter of waiting it is just a matter that it is never going to be a healthy relationship again
i dream about taking a knife and carving my stomach out until i can not feel anything anymore i can not wait to die
i just opened them and they are all expensive thoughtful gifts i have great parents and a great brother they give me everything i need want and more
i am doing a lot of reflecting thinking mindfulness selfwork i am going to the gym going for walks in the sun eating better
feeling alone at this time of the year is the normality for millions of people so we need to do everything we can to bring people together and to spend some time with even if it is just a quick chat on the internet
i would never do this before i broke we are long distance so we can only talk on the phone or internet
i fill the void with my writing and analyzing cartoons and my art and all that and those are the only times i feel notempty
it is not even that i want to die i want my old life back but that can not happen and i would rather just go to sleep and not wake up
fourth and this big by this point i honestly feel very heavy with it all and next week i felt totally fine surprised myself i thought i got over and now i am good
the best thing that can come out of this is personal growth move on look inside improve yourself and keep moving forward
i am not sure if it is the right subreddit where to publish it but here is my story i did not even answer the call but he asked why they were calling
but for my family who would have to go through the pain of my death if i did it i just do not know what alternative there is
i am torn here because on one hand its her life and she can do wants on the other hand i can not imagine thinking it would be ok for me to that
also struggling with self acceptance and understanding the world around me i felt so small and so afraid sad scared and i fought for salvation
i was diagnosed bipolar severe anxiety disorder and a touch of schitozeffective i am not looking to hurt myself just so we are clear
this thought leads me to what might have contributed to her negative behaviors in the relationshipthough i should join since life seems really empty
i feel like i can not reach out to anyone hence me posting on reddit he has problems depression anxiety a lot of stuff jus like me
for example at her most extreme she went from happy and in love with me one morning during breakfast to pissed and upset that i do not love her enough to feeling guilty and ashamed and apologetic later to angry and frustrated again
the guy knew me and her was in a relationship with her but he still went on and kept trying to get her i had every right to curse him out but she just simply saw me as the bad guy because he is her bf now
on the day of his flight he confessed to me that he started talking to his ex few days before and he is confused
i am just hoping they will not notice anything being off but it still makes me anxious af i saw this subreddit as a place to vent and i guess i am doing that right now
i have not got anything to leave you random strangers of reddit all i have is that i wish you a good day
sitting in it observing it not wallowing in it mind you gives me wisdom it is uncomfortable no goods moods only big sad i would look the same
okay i do not know how many of you are familiar with the old movie called it is a wonderful life i do not know how old it is but it is black and white so it is pretty old
on wednesday she decided to block my cell number and unfriend me on social media platforms which i understand i am not posting this for people to read just to get this off my chest
i just feel so numb and sick and tired of suffering every day one of my cousins would not even look at me when i tried to talk to her
they will not let me have my boyfriend over they have never met him even after over a year they hate that i am gay more than anything
5 years asked for space due to issues built up due to her lack of empathy towards my anxiety which i am currently talking to a counselor for and communication issues we have
all the people who have hurt me are happy i feel almost angry that i had to suffer the brunt of everything
it has happened several times again but tonight was the last straw i am simply pathetic i deserve lot worse than what i got
this girl was my whole world for two years but upon looking back on our relationship i cannot help but wonder how long she had truly been faking it
i was upset with things and i just wanted the pain to end for just a moment because it was not something that could be blamed it was all internal and jealousy and constant anxious thoughts constantly eating at me
i knew their inventory like the back of my hand and he took all my work from me she has been doing self harm for a few years now and shows a couple signs of pure of
we had issues with his strict parents and he brought up breakup a few days ago we are still figuring out but i feel he does not value me
why am i so fucking miserable how can i get back to my old self confident jovial extrovert self please help
my main problem i think i have worked out to be catastrophising and a negative self voice big arguments will usually happen when i have done something slightly wrong my partner points it out and says where i could have gone better not in a horrible or mean way
by the time i am eighteen and i get out of here my entire life will have been wasted college seems unlikely and i will never make friends
and now i am going to go read some of you folkss posts thanks for reading if you did and i hope you have a better day tomorrow and an even better day after that
but our government decided to try out a new software to correct our answer sheets and i was actually one among the few students who did not fail in the board exams
if anyone needs someone to talk to about anything hit me upsend me a message on reddit or on my instagram lukas_van_impe
basically being thrown in the deep end and forced to talk to people nonstop all day kind of does that but when i got home i felt like i was going in the same routine
what did i asked you to change only one thing be less rude with me and touch your heart every time you talk to me
targeted isolation where someone or a group of someone is actively turn others away from an individual for whatever reason making them feel as if their views are worthless to the rest of the world
i am specifically looking for girl friends because this is an i want people to hang out and be friends with not i am offering services for horny
because i can not leave this family now i think about all the fucked up relationships i had i think about how much i hate myself
like it is always one thing after another with no end and most of all i am tired of trying to handle all of my problems alone
i wanted to be the best lover the most purei really do not know why everyone lately making fun of me my thoughtsmy ideas and everything about me
now keep in mind that i was a student living off of my savings and did not have a job this was not a study abroad program either luckily though my lack of responsibilities gave me something even more valuable than money time
all my friends back home are either committed engaged or having kids yeah they are really young and they keep asking me if i have found someone yet every time they see me
so yeah my lifes pretty much in the shitter and has been for the past year now like it is really shitty
i wish i understood why i am lovenumb because i really want a connection it is tough being alone all the time it really is
i have googled around a bunch and have only seen a few instances of this described by people online i am wondering if it is just something random that i experience or if it is related to trauma
i had my suspicions but i wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that maybe i was wrong maybe he was feeling happier
no one loves me i am not strong enough to keep doing this on my ownagain do you see me talking about him too much
averaging 240 hours every two weeks i am married to my jobwell since technically it was just 2 weeks into the relationship
i hear every night how iam worthless and just a joke i let my emotions take over and blind me so much i can not communicate i can not feel happiness
whilst i am doing better and the suicidal thoughts are gone i do not want to do anything i am not sure how to get over this wall
i am 24 and i do not have much social life and i never had a girlfriend in my life because of this and also other feelings accumulated i am never happy since many years
like why can not i be viewed as one of you allor when guys tell me i do not make sense or i think like a girl because no shit
hi i have never posted on reddit before but i have heard this community is very nice so i thought i would try
i was not happy and i was having sight problems but did not knew so my grades started to go down and the beatings started to get me to make my grades better
i come to the realization that i can not really go on with life without her i am currently investigating my flaws and looking to change for the positive
basically my head hurts non stop and there is no cure or because i am tired of even thinking about it so will not go into too much detail spent whole year going to doctors i can not work or study in this condition i can barely play video games or do any of my old hobbies so when i am out of savings in a few months i am kind of out of options for what to do
i have made another friend m16 i have a similar problem with and he is really sweet which is the issue because i am even more obsessed i will just constantly check his social medias to see if he is unfollowed me and gotten bored of me
this is for the best here is a list i made about the things i did not like in him which made things even worse because i cut too deep and had to get a tt
i walked up the stairs softly and peeked around the corner to see my daughter playing her cello she must have been fifteensixteen her room filled with books and sheet music
i think it was at that point in time where i felt i had some type of energy that pushed people away
edit after realizing the consequences and other things i have stopped thinking about suicide it is not worth ithow do you tell someone who you love that you are going to kill yourself soon
now here is the danger when you are engaging in no contact you will probably ruminate on all kids of reasons to break your silence and reach out to your ex as a result your breakup wounds will once again open up
most of the perpetrators of these crimes are loners with no friends no girlfriend shy introverted and often times live at home with their mother
i have had some health issues in my familywe were a very big but close family when i was younger but we all slowly split apart and i question whether or not i would be sad if these people died or if i would react how i expect myself too and just not care
and then i see all the people who do not have to live with the attachment disorders and autisticy emotional scars and mental illness that i have they literally look at me and tell me that it is my fault i just do not think positively enough hahaha
over the period of time you were in my life i loved you with more heart than i own but love was and never has been easy and let us be realistic and not fail to remember the struggle we had
i had a life and a wife and very comfortable life wife decided she wanted more than i could offer so she cheated at 42 years old i have recently found myself single and alone and i do not know how to deal with it does anyone have any advice for me
i also struggle with disorded eating i constantly count calories even though i am underweight i am afraid of gaining weight i do not want to become skinnier i just want to keep my current weight so it is not that bad but still i used to self harm i used to smoke i do not have a drinking problem but honestly i feel so terrible that i would get drunk right now if i was home alone
i hope the cold hole in my chest leaves and the negative thoughts in my head disappears i pray day and night for even one of my old friends to say hi
how did all that happen and i am just here playing catchup on these inside jokes about group chats i am not a part of like i was so excited that everyone would be starting at the same blank slate and yet somehow other peoples are filled up before i have even unpacked my boxes
we are basically the same person and very loyal to each other we have the same interests and love doing the same things
now i am nervous because i am out of my comfort zone but i am free now he can not come to my room to call me piece of sit
cook for friends to save them from having to buy the groceries cooking them doing the dishes etc slip 10 bills into random mailboxes at neighboring houses
i believe she want me to leave because there simply are not any feelings for me but does not have to balls to break up
with a lot of things she opened the flood gates and made me feel safe and loved i am so fucking empty and at this point nothing will change that besides temporary coping methods
i also have 2 friend groups the one is full of people i know since schcool but they are all constantly busy so they do not have time the other one is actually a discord group where my best friend and her boyfriend are also in but those people are all just so mean to each other and disrespectfull and really talking about sensible things that just
the only problem is we were long distance i started getting clingy and attached and he started drifting away it was just like friends but with a little tension
the guilt and dread are in the back of my head literally every second but i can not even begin to work on things because i do not even know if i can even do it
last week she complaint again and it was the last time we had a good chati have been suicidal since i was 10 for various reasons i am now almost 21
it reminds me of the things i have not done yet and all the things i could have achieved i am not trying to be dramatic but i can not take this it is getting tougher and tougher
i can not remember how it feels to have someone taking care of me when i am not well i can not remember how it feels like to do cute little gestures for someone i love romantically vice versa
she was understanding and said i would be able to reference and that i could reach out any time wow is not that fucking amazing wow
i have no way of contacting any of her family or friends and i do not know where she exactly lives so i can not call help to her door and i think i am the only one that knows she wants to suicide
then i leave the hospital 17 days later i had not seen my mom that long and i really missed her dearly
i seriously saw a future with her i have had dreams about this woman and fantasized about going on all kinds of adventures with her
john moreland the new album is good but not my flavor but it got me listening to high on tulsa heat again which is a goddamn masterpiece
back when i lived with my whole family 09 basically everyone abused me both my siblings did not like me and would bully me my mother hit me and treat me like i was the worst thing to happen to her and my dad frequently hit me yelled at me and would throwslam my head into things
no school i guess that would happen at some point anyway i kind of drifted away from all my friends before the school shut down i can not make any friends online everybody is an adult that does not share any of my interests i just want close friends someone i feel comfortable talking to tried dming some old friends nothing feels worse than no reply hopefully i can survive until school comes back
the money you save on buying a cheaper machine is lost when you destroy it in an attempt to improve it using skills that you do not possess in a field where you have no training
then in the back of my mind all i can think is what if it does not help you and you end up all alone and suicidal
i even made the mistake of blaming them for every fight we got into and then trying to make it up to them by desperately buying gifts
i am getting very bitter because i feel like i missed out on so much before this happened i know that my life is not over yet but i feel so helpless at this point
but i keep getting old and the days are the same also it is impossible to begin with i do not why i am having hope and getting up every day and doing the same things fooling myself that there is someday
weed helps me distract myself from my thoughts do not get me wrong i still hang out with my friends we make an effort

the medications i am on has both helped and hindered further my libido has been largely dulled by the antidepressants but when it returns it is not a constant thing and very unpredictable the taking away of my libido has made the loneliness a bit more tolerablebut it does not stop the need for love or the need to spend my life with a significant other when my libido is back the loneliness is so much worse
i have had a bunch of friends who are close to me tell me the relationship was toxic and that i should have gotten out of it a long time ago but i still loved her and did not want to do it

hello everyone this is my first post ever on any platform and i guess i just had to finally write how i feel somewhere
constantly helping people feel better but never having someone to help me being the emotional support for my friend and then for family has gotten too much
i ignored this feeling for the entirety of middle school and just cut corners whenever it came to socializing with people but i definitely had my fair share of embarrassing moments
i am some number of shots of whiskey in and it does not seem to do anything for me maybe its time to switch to rum i do not drink every day nor is it for any reason its my first time in a month

so if you self diagnose too hasty let us say with depression you begin to look for symptoms of it snd see that it fits you and you begin to look for symptoms everywhere you only look for symptoms that look like those you read online about

he asked me out for coffee i said yes we just chatted about life the only things i can think about are her voice smell us going skiing or buying damn groceries
i would be lying if i said that i still do not think about her time to time and everything i would have done differently as i went through the breakup
i was happy and then i lost what was making me happy all because i was to afraid to commit to a serious relationship again
i know every situation is different but i am really struggling to find some understanding in this breakup everything was so good

and it did break me when he told me he loved her so after that i did not really ask him to get back with me i mean obviously i can not
not knowing whether i would wake up to my parents being in a good mood or screaming at me and blaming me for everything that has gone wrong in their lives
to give such a hope to give such a gift one must have it to help others cultivate happiness one must master the art of happiness for self
i can not stand always being put down for talking to my dad since my mom and dad had a nasty divorce many years ago and i really do not want to be here right now
but recently i brought up that he was distant and did not say i love you anymore and it hurt and felt bad that he was pulling away despite all the effort i am putting in
but the worse part is i do not think it is going to change i believe i am going to ens up alone completely alone
i know i am unhappy with myself and i do not think i ever will be happy with myself again there lies a lot of my issues
suicide and cheating basically i will not say who did whatthis makes it impossible for me to forge new friendships and all of them just gradually die off instead
we blocked his phone number on all of our phones and our land line as well as his email but every time i heard a noise outside at night or i got a phone notification i was terrified

faith trust of something greater this is all for our greatest and highest selves through the hardships through the pains through the ups and the downs through everything we must look within
i look at old pictures and videos and i can not help but think what happened where did we go wrong why did not we allow ourselves to be mad at each other why could not we communicate with each other

j went on a whole speech about how i need to learn how to open up and love myself before i try to get into another relationship
otherwise i thought about ingesting toxic products but this time i will read everything about it first because i do not want to survive and just have dysfunctional organs lmao otherwise i thought about hanging myself i am scared but i am willing to do it
it took me until the middle of this year to finally realise that i had subconsciously tried to make myself od and die and came incredibly close to doing so
this happened again last night but this time i was not dissociating in the first place it was triggered by what i think was the stress from trying not to relapse s3lf hrm
they are very religious and think being gay is a sin so you can guess how it went when i attempted to come out to my mom last year
i forget very very often that i have to write down things on my hand or pieces of paper to remember them
it was kind of a mutual break up but she wanted it to end more than i did then came 2019

and it is hard to find any solice in the way i have been treated i have tried to talk about this to people but my pain is often not validated
around the time i was 14 he had started to not talk to me as much and i remember him telling me at some point i think when i was 16 how he would not come visit or have sex with me if i was still a virgin

i 17f just broke up with my exboyfriend 18m of two weeks i know it is just a short period time but now i am kind of seeing someone else

thanks for reading my little rant but i just had to write this somewhere because i am getting tired cropping it all up
my head and stomach hurts all the time i am always in pain and feel sick he has been losing friendships over the years
early into our relationship we established the rule that neither of us would ever meet up with someone of other gender alone without telling each other beforehand i was cool with that and followed that rule religiously also i rarely met with any dudes alone but in the off chance a much older coworker invited me for lunch or something i would let my ex know ahead of time
last night she said she posted her running route and personal info she basically said she wants to be raped again because it will mean she is in control i have tried to get her to see reason
but he never really said anything i also at one point asked if we are ok and he said yes why would not we be
i miss her so much but i can not help but feel i am slowly losing any motivation i had to get her back sometimes i think this is the right thing to do and at other times i do not think this
should i step in on that obviously she hurt her too because she did consider me a friend too and obviously still does
also during the entirety of lockdown we only chatted on the phone once and it is always me bringing up meeting up or chatting i do not know what to do i do not want to drop them because they mean a lot to me despite what being their friend feels like but i feel like i am more invested than they are
it is like just because they have someone else in their life we are not friends anymore i have no way to contact them to even let them know i am not okay i feel helpless
if they do not want you in their life anymore than it is their loss a guy who does not want to be kept will not stay
it effected me to the point where i did not even go and see her again until last week so i have stopped watching them both since the start of lockdown and overall it is helped me a lot
this came as such a surprise because when we started talking i was so open about my past relationship and how traumatic it was for me this was the point i lost my composure and broke down after which he started to apologise to me but i could not get myself to accept that apology
new to reddit someone told me it helps them hopefully they do not see this after i graduated college i started doing everything that i am supposed to to treat mental illness
consequently my academics suffered and you only further belittled me for that i now also have serious trust issues and undervalue my own achievements
i thought antidepressants would help me at least get through the day but they are not enough i tried to distract myself with school and my hobbies but it is not enough
i was starting to freak out on her and the only way i know how to deal with that is to step away from the situation and try to calm down but she does not like it when i leave calls
one lasted 2 weeks before he cheated and left my ex who i thought was the love of my life my best friend treated me so well only 9 months before he left for another state to do drugs
then the stepfather was even worse he was drinking more and fighting more he was also a bandit and a junkie
after so long of hearing that i constantly go back and forth with the emotions 1 are those people right am i really crazy and being unrealistic or 2 fuck those people
for my entire life since i started realizing what is love i have always been craving for it never ever hav i got it even once
and if you were physically mentally emotionally and spiritually connected to that person then it takes the longest time i am definitely a giver i like to give to people but no one wants what i can give
i had bad grades in math i lied a lot had a pessimistic aspect of life and i hated my family deep down despite all the love they give me
to top it off i was super paranoid today my manger noticed and i asked if i could take my 15 minute break earlier
i had a little panic attack last night and my hands went numb and tingly and my sense of touch gets super changed and noticeable ig you could say like its the only thing my body is focused on whatever its touching rubbinh itching grabing i woke up today and it was still like that why
i have so much to deal with share with i am unable to it is right there i can not reach it can not reach them can not reach my feelings
in 19 years i have had maybe 10 friends with every person i form a friendship with i go through a cycle
slowly our talks became less frequent as we had less and less to talk about until one day we just did not write anything to each other anymore which was convenient for me because i was too much of a coward to break up
it is not even been taking that much to get me to go off just being purely jealous of someone and wanting to be like them has gotten this to happen
i do not spend my days stalking her social media or thinking about if she will ever text me again seeing my parents so hurt all of this going down within the span of five hours
i was in my college semester at this time i told her 4 weeks later i could not take it anymore i was becoming even more hopeless
he continued to call and eventually my dad answered and told him that he was going to call the police if he called again but that did not stop him
i was broken up with out of the blue but it is never out of the blue we do not talk about me or my needs
this shit makes my life shit i feel alone a sense of nilihism and depression and trapped as i can not prove to myself that it is not true
could it be all this pressure to be jolly i f 28 have quit lexapro which i was prescribed for depression and anxiety about half a year ago because of the weight gain and poor results after taking it for a year
tldr sensitive guy with past negative experiences with toxicity in his friendships wants to learn how to deal with it without overthinking it or getting hurt
the nursing home was in the process of taking moms house for medical expenses so to me i was losing my childhood
when my parents knew about it my mom told me it was the most sensitive part if the body so i need to take care of it
some of the things she said or does makes me think who is this where is the woman i fell in love with
it is better looking at short term gains distractions for the ennui but covid has removed the few joys i have used to blow off steam and forced me to observe the fruitlessness of my live filled with meaningless labor
he opened up to me about his ex and i opened up about my boyfriend i was basically trash talking about my boyfriend telling him everything wrong about him
but she left me she gave up on us and did not even give me an explanation i begged her to stay but she did not even give me the respect to do it on call
i wanted to die so bad and i hated myself because i know it was all my fault i found some help by going to therapy and working out
he will not respond to texts but views my story within minutes of me posting it i just do not know what to do anymore
long story short i decided to resign from my job to prepare for my next career choice which involves being in great shape fast forward three weeks and i feel like i am in worse state than what i was in with my miserable job
i just needed to vent this out before going crazy it seems messed up but she had insisted on us taking this place and if she did not we would have moved out and gotten our own place when we got the money years ago before covid wrecked our finances
we both cried a lot before going apart and right now it has been almost 3 weeks since we fell apart
one can not afford to stay drunk or high all of the time anyway we have even said i love you to each other
and man whenever that time hits i feel like i can not breathe i can not just call you when i wake up in the middle of the night anymore
it is natural to be stressed about university applications grades the future and whatnot but i am stressed to the point i feel like i am on the verge of a breakdown every 30 minutes
she nodded and agreed she said she wants to see me someday when we both moved on and we are okay again
a guy who does not want to be kept will not stay and you have to learn that things like this happen all the time
i met someone with whom i had no contact for 5 years and she is currently working and founded a new family but still she feels lonley so i was wondering who can relate to this situation who works or has founded a family but still feels lonely
she will not come back she decided to leave and i have to respect that i know my worth and i know someone else out there will know it someday too
all my life i have been helping others to stand to their feet and be positive thinkers now i am feeling like this myself without someone helping me like i did to others
i am not the type of person to leave someone when they are suffering nor the type of person who puts sex and sexual attraction first
all my life i have been lonely i was raised in a tiny town where there were barely any others my age
i understand not to compare but i went through so much of of my side of the breakup that i gained weight fell into depression for someone that had moved on while i was feeling sorry myself the whole time
we started arguing more and more and i have to say that i should have been more gentle in those moments
only at the end one woman from village approached me to take care of me while my mum was in hospital
we were talking and hanging lots and we really got to make a genuine connection i want to go to japan and hawaii and the uk
the feelings i had for her were definitely coming but it reminded me of a past girl her name was melanie
my coworkers get upset at me for answering this way when i return from a trip to a new place and i wonder why they are angry at me i mean i am not asking them to charge my trip to their plastic
but with every passing year i think i am getting better at it loneliness of course i still feel that slow sinking feeling
i have my family too of course one younger brother 8 year apart since i live abroad away from them i have learnt to build an emotional wall with them as well i do spend time with them but i never open up
for example i would say hey i need at least 3 days alone a week becasue i have a lot of school work to do and it would last a week or two
i do not have any grandparents my last one granny died 3 years ago she was a sweet woman my grandpa had parkinsons and my other grandma had alzheimers my granny always liked candy those cheap hard candy you see at the convenience store fruit punch was her favorite
but as years passed i realised what a big failure and piece of shit i am compared to them stop being so undeniably difficult that it mentally breaks you down tears you into tiny pieces shatters your heart
2 years passed and i was a very good girlfriend very loyal it did not matter to me he did not love me it did not matter to me that when things went south he started chatting with people online in front of me to punish me
before covid i went to the university or office where i can focus on what i am working on and relax at home
sometimes it is just me thinking of doing something creative like making a youtube video of me playing guitar and almost as though it was someone elses thought suddenly it is followed up by i should post that right before killing myself
however around this time last month she called me and said what we were doing was not healthy and she wanted to fully distance
i have never been a happy person i have been lonely most of my adult life but it did not bother me like it is doing right now
i have hung out with them a few times but i do not want do that a whole lot more because i am trying to distance myself from my ex as much as i can
i do not have family to be around either so i am just sitting at home lonely as hell i trusted him i never had any loyalty concerns
so i watched this video called 21 years old i have no friends on youtube it was randomly recommended to me and tbh i felt personally attacked
we are currently at the stage where he slowly realizes that telling me to try making an organized weekly plan is probably not a solution for my inability to get out of bed
i find it very hard to connect with people and make friendsit is ok to be separated it is ok it is all has ended
turning 19 today made me realize that my life is continuing without me if i can not fix this i will feel this way till i die and i do not want that
i am 18 that is a good age to die at i have no one everyone leaves i am killing myself goodbye it is hard to move on when i do not even feel like i want to
now i see his face everywhere and people talk about it at bars and stores and i can not escape this torment she was everything to me and he treated her terribly but she still opened up to him in a way she would not to me
my grades were awful this year i was only passing two grades they were both as though so that is good ig
this showed me some valuable lessons and i really feel stupid that i did not do it earlier i am really trying to change and see how much i screwed up this relationship
yet when i turn my phone off and lay there in the moment i feel uneasy and restless it is like merely existing is not even pleasurable so i get back on my phone but again it is not pleasurable
my parents are both christian and raised me as one australian christians tend to be very different from american ones in the mainstreams i find
i will be too old to build a life for myself get a job or even just be an emotionally strong person
i do not know that i will not attempt it again tomorrow i have lost all my friends the support of my family everyone
but i think i know why but i am not certain as of yet some of my mates have girlfriends and ever since i feel as if i need one
i feel as though i am drifting through life i am broken he has not shown any kindness towards me or any interest
our relationship has grown in some ways but there is a lot of anguish there as well and i do not know what to do
i basically have the perfect life as others say i have good grades i have a nice family i have supportive friends i have a girlfriend
i really force myself to talk about the stuff i do not want to because it is what you are supposed to do bottling it all up will never help
i can not say these things out loud but i want to thank so many people for bringing happiness into my life merry christmas what a beautiful day to leave it all behind this is my last bit of love i am putting into the world i hope when i am gone you all feel on some subatomic level that i love you goodbye
death on my mind everyday my deathnot by suicidei do not want to put my self out there to be struck downanymore
agin i have never attempted suicide and i do not think i would ever go through with it but damn its nice to day dream about
i am worried because she does not need this toxicity in her lifei am planning to kill myself pretty soon i truly believe that there should be a medical option to kill yourself through lethal injection if you want
we usually text each other from morning to night everyday so around 9pm i asked him what he had for dinner
it is the truth i am the problem here i am an asshole i am just a dick i have made everybody in my life hate me because i have a short temper really awful social skills and i say stuff that is condescending without meaning to or realizing
i had never replaced a keyboard key before did not know what i was doing yet thought i could handle this task myself
but i think that i learned a lot coming through the other side i grew as a person i found a better job and am planning on moving up in the world
if only i could find a therapist who would not see the masshealth bit and just helpshameless was one show me and lance understood on a regular mindset of what we perceived that show
and then i had to stop talking to herbut now she had a very bad time similar to mine when she was a child now she is very happy
i just want to feel like there are people around or even to find someone i can trust and spend time with but it feels like no one really wants a single mom
so in most of the endings v gets only 6 months to live and there is even a small bit of hope for a cure i think i am going to give myself 6 months too who knows maybe i will find some way to turn things around
i am not the one to hold grudges but even though i found out he created a tinder account a week earlier i did not want to pin that on him
despite feeling like i would spend every day of my life either being fiercely miserable or just getting by i am somehow here smiling so much my face hurts
i probably did i am scared now though everyone is counting on me to do the best i can to do really well in college
i was more than i thought i would be able to handle but i stood up again and again i am proud of myself that i got so far
trying to go back to her tell her how much i still love her and want to do anything to fix what was broken but that is the absolute opposite of what i should do
i can not man i keep on thinking i leaked something when i know i did not discord fucked me over hard mentally
i am physically incapable of bearing my own child i was born without a uterus this pains me more than one could know
it literally feels like i made a giant mistake and i made innumerable mistakes of course but i do not think i realized the implications of actually breaking up i just wanted to do the right thing and i could not be the partner he wanted or needed at the time i wish i could undo the past
feel like finding real relationshipsfriends are so hard nowadays and everything just comes and goes in my life hopefully i will look back at this and think how silly i was
whenever i am completely alone i always have this overwhelming feeling of missing someone but no one from my past that i can findthink of gives me the same feeling
i still saw symptoms over the next few months but it felt like he was aware and had himself in check
my doctor told me to take melatonin and my sleep returned to normal i was doing okay until about february of 2020
nowadays i can not really stand them i really hope it is just because of the age but that childhood shit might have been subconsciously affecting me they love me but i do not love them back i am pretty cold to them
i saw all the signs all the red flags your lack of effort and your unwillingness to open up to me
and then i realised howso my i am at my moms for the week for christmas and i left the house for one day
i can not start a conversation a call or anything without writing down my agenda kid you not i had to write down the agenda for catching up with a very good friend with whom i somehow lost contact after he moved to another country and due to the lockdown i was already feeling pretty worked up
i was a grandma child i really fucking do not i have tried to kill myself in the past at times i felt so alone
anyway the problem arises that i sometimes really need help and i do not know how to ask for it there is just so much too much
i checked this sub reddit out it is full with lonely people like me screaming at the void and this my scream at the void
i dk hope that is not too morbid or mean considering i feel that way about myselfreally mundane situation here but it still worries me
so do you have intrusive thoughts if so what are they plz sharewhy honestly why was i such a dick to my mother
many times when i would join a group to talk with i get overlooked with my words i do not know when i will not be lonely anymore
i am an outgoing person who likes to meet new people i am a bit shy but i like to talk to people
most of the women i know around me have kids i do not by choice and i am finding it hard to meet new people
christmas and new year makes it fucking worse recently i have had angry tearful breakdownsi am also an active blogger and am slowly but surely building up a decently sized following
they tell you that pain is temporary when you grow up and go through school at least i was to me it seems the only temporary thing in this world is happiness and actually feeling thing living is just constant pain
one day s and i decided to take 900 ug of lsd at a park now both of us are experienced with psycadelics and have tripped together before we made it back to my apartment where had a long conversation that over due while tripping in my bathtub and decided to become official
nothing has gotten better and everything has just gotten worsei am not sure why anymore there is very little left of me lmao
i realize my choice is incredibly selfish and not fair to my family and friends i think i am out
i believed her i was so in love and we often would talk about getting married and having a future together
i think it is time to leave this community i have make my way out of my depression thanks in part to you guys love for you guys you are awesome 3
sure i was physically alive but would you call somebody who did not have the mental strength to even sit up in bed as really being alive now every time i think about the fact that there is always a chance i may go through that again in the future i go numb
i just do not know what is wrong with me anymore i do not want to be here i just wish i could not wake up one day
he came and tried ti gave a heart to heart but it was difficult as his narcissistic younger brother was there shifting the conversation towards himself at every opportunity
he is very nice to me and its nothing about him necessarily i just am very insecure and make stupid scenarios of him leaving me and stuff like that
when i was not as lonely i did not care as much about being social but now i feel so desperate that i will chat up anyone who comes around
i do not lack anything at home on the contrary but still i feel like i am missing something an empty feeling that i can not fill and believe me i have tried a lot
i do not know why i am this way but it makes me feel so immature almost like i am failing at beeing an adult
i do not know how to move forward i do not know what to do with myself how do you go from taking to someone 247 to not at all
update sorry for not replying in the past few hours i spoke to my friend that lives miles away they called to wish me merry xmas happy new year
45pm i apologised thinking i ruined a pair of friends catching up and left she even digs into my mom for percieved slights that messed her up when she was a child
the moment the lie came out of my mouth i felt awful i do not lie and i can not make sense why i did that
cut to 2 years later and for the last 2 months of our relationship i started to suspect her and her coworker but all i had to keep me going was what she told me
i found my purpose in life this year which made me happy to study biology a switch flipped at some point around then and i stopped being suicidal and my depression basically vanished
i think it is the looks that give you freedom to do certain things and when you are ugly you just can not let yourself act foolish
i was elated and thought this was it this amazing guy who my ex wanted to be wanted me everything was going to workout
but i am too coward to kill my self i imagine how painful it is years or decades for the angel death to take me
i cried every night for a month about how much i love my best friend and how happy i am to be his best friend too
i feel like a joke and i do not have any hope lefti hope everyone finds their happiness and their peace take call all
it is been more than a year and i had seen this coming even before i actually broke up but it still hurts so much and i do not know how to move on his actions still bother me and i do not want to feel this way
however i did not tell anyone in summer of 2019 i hit my lowest and on two occasions i was ready to commit suicide
she said she feels pressured and give her time to think that we should just be alone for now i do not see what i could do about that
i drink daily and compulsively out of me having a narrow specific scopefield of interests and borderline obsessions and i take up after tvmovie characters when i find them interesting so much so to the point that i and my family can not believe how astounding my memory is of specific scenes
i am 22 years old man with zero handy man skills i can not do the following things properly1 it is hard for me to open wrapper of chocolate or chips properly
for the last few years 2829 i have been in and out of therapists only their dumba as fuck and did not get the whole story of what happened because it was too terrible
she said she does not believe that it was anything we could talk about or fix but i disagree since we had not even tried
i ended things with my significant other a while ago the one i love i still do i have felt so horrible and sick since it is the worst thing in the world hurting the one you love
feel your grief as well as your pain and be thankful that you can even feel those emotions in the first place
i told him 2 weeks prior breaking up with him that i am going to end our relationship i already gave you chance after chance for years and you messed it up every time
more i feel lonely more i am afraid that i will become just a bad person would you like to suggest some books or etc
i am 19 today and i have never even kissed a girl i do not feel like there is any life worth living when i have nobody and never have
suggestions channel we would love to hear your thoughts and ideas roles so we can learn a little about you
i knew someday she would die and i knew it would be a problem when i was younger and in middle school id get so depressed and just wanted my dog
it still widely affects me even though it ended i 2018 and i still do not feel ready for anything intimate even though i long for it
out of nowhere my mom called me on the phone telling me that one of their my parents tenants was coming to the house and that i had to receive the money and give him an acquittance
consequently i am going to stop as well i think it will not happen again and think it is better for our psychological wellbeing in the long term anyway
and generally just have a hard time motivating myself with anxiety being a double edged sword and basically being the only reason i get things done
i literally broke down and i feel so bad and i do not know if this is jealousy possessiveness or whatever it is because i mean it is over and i know i will not and can not get back with him ever
i saw how many of us have thought and questioned if we should be wishing them christmas hell i tried and made a complete fool of myself but i saw this post and i believe it should be here as well so thought of sharing it
he always reassured me when i need the reassurance he made me feel like i could open up at any time
all i ever wanted was a fucking hug when i was upset but no they instantly go to lecturing me and pretty much saying that i should stop crying and stop being dramatic
i do not get it i have not seen her in months but she can not spare a day and if she is not back for a week and a half why can not she do most of it until then
he said he still loves me and wants to be with me but he can not give me another chance he helped me pack my stuff he hugged me and cried with me
i just got out into the working world again after having my baby and now i am back home it is so frustrating and it is been such an awful week but overall i am just frustrated i am alone again
that is right virtual unreal convo i know you do it i can not look for help myself i can not afford it so it feels like the only solution
i live with my husband he grew up with his mother being depressed so when he sees me this way he gets triggered he calls me weak he even tells me he will not miss me if i were to die i know he does not mean it he is just triggered but it really hurts and it reinforces the idea in my head that i could just hide away and quitely check out without hurting anyone
the last time i did when i cut my wrist and had been bleeding out i would felt at peace i would felt ok with dying because living had been too fucking hard
i currently live at my moms house in a residence close to a beach government owned it was closed because it was christmas so the beach was totally empty of visitors
but i feel really guilty because what if she thinks i am still the same 8 year old i have been through some serious shit since she sent the first message
he knew how to manipulate me into feeling like i was the problem this is also my first serious relationship that i have been in
after one of our first big fights she locked herself in a room and cut herself it was a deep cut and she claimed it was a lapse in judgment
after a month she unexpectedly broke it off with me and what makes it worse is that it was a day after my birthday
i did and i will not say god knows how i survived it it was isvoice chat is even worse i get already stressed by thinking about joining a random voice chat
met her in april and we started dating for about a month there is nowhere i am doing actually good and i do not fit anywhere
so many things i would rather be doing and yet i am angry anyone else relate this happened three times then he started to distance himself
since then l was feeling so depressed and anxious l have been in therapy since then and l am still taking antidepressants
what does that say about me that i did not see it all that i trusted him so much i am working on all that through therapy i am just really feeling it all today
it continued to be like this for 5 months 5 months of pure depression and suicidal thoughts christmas used to be so magical i decorated have a great tree put christmas movies on bought hot chocolate
i forgot i was told that news 2 minutes later as i chose to continue with whatever had been keeping me entertained at that time usually video games or music
the only thing that consistently makes me happy are my cats but i can not bring them with me to college and it will be a long while before i will be able to afford an apartment which allows pets all in all life just sucks major ass which leads to my conclusion that it is not worth it
i am his first gf and he is my first serious bf too we had issues with his strict parents and he brought up breakup a few days ago
i left him once before when the drinking got so out of hand i caught him out drink driving my car that was absolutely not acceptable for me nor should it be acceptable to anyone but i also grew up with alcoholic parents who put me at risk many times by drink driving
so i explained about how i feel like i might be ready to at least discuss our issues again and maybe try to come to a compromise of some sort and asked him what he meant by something needing to change
i fundamentally find it difficult to believe that anyone could spare the time to actually forgo sexual and emotional experiences to the point where they would place this amount of investment into the early stages of a relationship
that i was living with him in the present not in the past that there was no need to be jealous there was nothing to be jealous of
i do not really know what i am asking for on here but did not really know where else to turn i guess what i am asking is if someone could just comment a suggestion to help me try and get through the next few days
thanks for everything but do you think i want to live like this do you think i wanted to quit just because my adhd has been killing me at my workplace and therefore i could not work for the past three years i have been contemplating suicide most nights before bed
i know adoption is an option and there are children out there who deserve to be loved but i can not help but also wish to see mini versions of my husbandme
i guess i should start by saying i have suffered from depression anxiety and panic attack disorder for 10 years now i am 21 years old
it is officially 3 months since we have broken up but it feels like an eternity everyday that passes i have less and less hope he will come back
every day i keep choosing to live but every day feels like just more of the bullshit i feel that i am swimming against the currents and i am drowning
i do not want to stop fighting for the people i love and cherish nothing is black and white in this and i deserve to explore all the options this world can give
i have tried to distract myself by reaching out to friends they were all busy i did not want to tell them what was going on playing video games playing with my dog and art i do not want to mention this to my parents because it is always a hard conversation to have
a very kind person on reddit just helped me with my cell phone i never had anyone do something so kind like that for me
some other person would definitely make my parents proud and live my life better unlike me they have these standards for me that i never even fucking asked for
i know this is selfish so i never complain simply just ask when they are next free and accept that as how it is
my mom is an emotionally cold woman who hardly hugged me and used to tell me not cry or she would give me something to cry about
the game made me realize it i ended up being so emotionally invested that i just helplessly watched as my body played it
nothing distracts me because i just want to share my life with him so i feel his absence in every second of my day
i just wish i had never existed it would be so much easier for everyone that went horribly wrong and here i am back at square one
23f been on meds for anxiety and depression for six months hospitalised for depression twice received therapy had ect in november
anyone have any suggestions or ideas or games like that then today at school she decided to text me right in the middle of class heyyy
i hear him talking with his friends but when there is just two of us seems like he got bored of me and goddamnit it sucks
your survival instincts kick in making you breathe involuntarily when this happens it is not painful at least not after the 1st or 2nd breath you are able to actually take a few breaths of water before you die this process is relatively peaceful you have a strong feeling of being tired you just want to sleep but this is the sleep you will not awake form
what i do to fight the negative emotions that permeate from my mind is i started practicing a daily meditations that i actively use during my daily life i always noticed that i would have many thoughts and emotions running through my mind during busy times and calm times but moreso on the calm times where its like my internal dialogue would over run my active mind and literally annoy me
because after all i never imagine romantic sexual things with these guys maybe i was going about this all in the wrong way but it does not matter i do not care anymore
and i wanted to share the message of a quote i found on reddit you are only able to truly love if you can be alone i will always have me and a nonselfish act of loving someone with expecting nothing back is only achievable if you are truly independent
loneliness is like a disease that keeps spreading throughout me i feel like i will never find a cure i feel like it is never ending
my mum and her husband are growing increasingly annoyed with this as as well as the money there is been 5 big boxes of her stuff in the garage for a year now
they were trying all these sorts of activities through her school making less time for us it was a mess for scheduling and it really strained the relationship basically pitting us against each other
me29m were in love with my gf 26f i speak to myself that will treat her like a princess she is my everything we have been together almost 2 years but since pandemic we have to live in different country
it is the end of the year and i am going through the worst period of my life mentally life feels to hard sometimes
all i wanted was to be a friend to her because i knew she would need it now but she just kept hurting me after break and into the breakup and idk
a month ago i broke up with the man i thought was my soulmate my heart ached thinking of him he was the first person to make me feel like love exists then it faded for him i was so used to doing everything that by the end i barely noticed that he did nothing when i realised it after months and months of emotional abuse and one time physical abuse i left
i tend to be really hard on my self and debating just sending my boss the money she may have lost out on
i did not finish the task the task you gave me takes at least 3 hours to complete and you gave me one
just really down to the means of being able to do is successfully i guessat least many people are experiencing some kind of isolation right now
i was cutting a lot more after me and my bf broke up i started seeking for counselling at home i feel incredibly lonely
i know many of us including me are dealing with this issue which sometimes feels like it will never get better
this has been ruining my life for as long as its been a problem and i just want to move on with my life and be happy i have a baby on the way and so much to live for i just want to feel that way
it was not long at all but it just felt so god damn right it was something i knew i could stick with
so much stuff has happened that we are both unhappy i have changed my ways and got help for the things i could not fix myself
i was having a burn out and thought i would go onto reddit adhd group there to talk to people who maybe have the same problem
i have got a feeling it will not work out i am alone in a bar after a particularily tough shift we both tried to make things work for so long i feel so intertwined in every way with him
a few days back i unblocked her on my insta as i was deleting my old accounti created a new account with a different name and she messaged me there too
however i still feel waves of anxiety which even causes me to have some weird twitches at times honestly i just overall feel exhausted
we returned back home together and i asked you about us i had never done anything like this in my life it was completely against my morals
as someone who had suffered from depression for a long time it felt like i was finally climbing out of it
but if he does not feel the same way what is the point i just feel trapped in this situation i wish you could love me
the next day she called me and said i was acting weird i told her that i felt uncomfortable because it felt weird
if there is anything my mom has taught me with this repeating hell named bipolar it is tenacity resilience and self reliance bordering on insanity so i truly hope that this traanslates to dealing with myself
i learned i will be getting another operation done next year which is making me feel pessimistic about my future 11 years of doctors appointments clinical trials surgeries and radiation and nothing has changed
just thinking about taking some klonopin and pain pills and washing it down with rum tonight the mental pain is almost becoming physical
what do i do to fix this antidepressants just make me more disaociated and bland any proffesional advice or mental health experts have a two cents
i was never able to tell my parents because they were always busy with my sister and they thought i was incredibly lazy and ungrateful
they used to be shorter but now they have grown and they look more beautifulsorry if i made some mistakes my english is not really good
so what happens is i can watch any film or be it a programme on tv and ill get so involved in the film and its characters that i start to feel a strong connection with them and then if one of them dies or the film ends i suddenly feel super empty and so drained
my mom does not want to come back home until she is 100 no one has covid to protect me since i have a very weak immune system and my dad who is 69 and vulnerable because of his age
the worst part is that i would never receive an explanation i would never receive anything i did not deserve the love the patience and the good treats that other girls received
my whole life i have never felt enough not smart enough not tall enough not funny enough not pretty enough not athletic enough not artistic enough talentless ordinary i know there is value to being normal because i can imagine it being equally stressful on the other end of the spectrum but i guess it my selfishness that wishes that i could be recognized as something because it can help solidify my sense of self
i just saw my ex friends today wich made me so anxious i can barely breathe my life feels devoid of meaning the fact my partner has left only gives evidence to by detrimental thoughts
i will try to keep it as brief as possible but i honestly do not remember having close true friendships since maybe primary school yep you read that right primary school
his brother and his parents have told me they have been worried about him for years but they just seem to be disappointed in him or something never really making an effort to help
when my parents were the because of my pain and i still live as this decaying fkn fetus internally i am rotting away and i have never seen the light of day
i have told people i am suicidal and it is brushed off my doctors told me they can not do anything if i will not get sectioned they will not sectioned me until i have got to the hospital for an attempt either but that would ruin my chances of ever becoming a teacher so i am stuck
you lost the best thing that has ever happened to you so many things i wish i could say to him so much pain
i like to travel but once i get to my destination and check into my hotel i find the thought of having to cross sights off my list to be frustrating and even depressing
she said she was following my life on twitter after 10 minutes i started sobbing i got engaged planned a wedding was assaulted and everything ended in just a few short months
when i spend time with people in that moment the thought that all this will be trivial in 10 years from now and maybe just a faint memory is just sad and that everything 10 years from now will be so trivial 20 years ahead is even worse
my best advice is to take everyone is advice on how to move on focus on yourself let time heal your wounds and take your mind off of himher
we are still figuring out but i feel he does not value me like when we have problems it is always me thinking of solutions but he just play games to avoid
so my ex told me today that if you can get down here you can come for a few and he said he will get me a flight just kind of shocked we broke up almost two months ago
now the problem although being an overall good looking guy and being very social i was never really into the club scene and spent most of my time heavily involved in semiprofessional athletics
instead i fantasize about you suffering about you dying the most painful and brutal death while i smile and laugh at your last moments
i just feel like i do not fit in and i just want to change school and start over i am also going to change job to where one of my friends work so that will be better i guess
i feel guilty and inadequate for feeling this way when i have been blessed with so much i am just existing i go to work come home sleep repeat
i have not been motivated to do anything especially very important things like applying for internships or taking important exams i have just been doing the bare minimum at the last minute
we talked and snap chatted pretty much everyday for a month and i even got to go on a date with her and we were planning on a second one
even though logically i am pretty certain we would never work again because i could not trust her i know deep in my heart what i really want is another chance together
i just kind of want to die lmao does anyone understand how i feeli am going to keep this brief cuz i know no one is going to read this anyway
i found out she was married the entire time it is been 9 years since she left and 5 years since i last saw her
i know i am not entitled to any of those things and i know some people are worse off than me but it is just so damn painful this overwhelming feeling of worthlessness insignificance and unimportance
for example if i want to rearrange the books like a normal person no ocd i will worry because in the past i may have made a promise to gods about never rearranging the books because that time the compulsion was about rearranging the books
i was in a relationship with this girl for four years i had given her my everything and loved her more than myself i truly believed that she was the one
and then if you politely mention that it is unnecessarily they try to accuse you of being weak and triggered when all you were really doing was trying to make things less unpleasant sigh some people just do not know how to be anything but rude
but what is it like to realize people view me as x and i had no idea was it an incident a destiny with drugs what happened and what was it like did you suddenly realize you needed help and and think back on your life and never thought anything was wrong until then
i want to die soon tomorrow would be fine for mepeople these days are modern day slave ownersor they wish they were
i recently got dumped by my now exgirlfriend i can not say it was really out of the blue or that i was not expecting it because in reality i felt it coming for a while i saw our relationship not working out the way we hoped but i still fought for it because i love her meanwhile she just sat there and kept herself occupied so she did not have to think about it
i was with my ex partner for 8 12 years i also lived with him for the majority of that period
it is christmas eve and we have presents galore for the kids thanks to our 21 year old emptying her bank account for her siblings
i am a 17 year old male i have been dating this girl for the past 4 months and my brain has been ruining everything
but i think i am the only single person out of my siblings i have no childrennot really sure how to start this i have never been much of a writer
hard roads may lead to beautiful destinations if you are a big meany pants just know i do not think it is unforgivable but i hope you get better and learn to live a more genuine meaningful life of real prosperity and communion it does not have to be this way
i have a fucking right to complain i feel horrible that the money we have been waiting on just had not come in time for christmas
i still love you so much you and i care for you on such a deep level i was blinded by my own fantasy my own idea of us in my head
she also told me it was because we were separated for so long and she is been dealing with some personal issues
is anybody else scared of their ex giving someone else what used to be yours whether that be love and affection smiles time or even their body
however i do feel like there is a lot of stigma towards healthcare professionals with mental health problems and the assumption that beacuse of this it they are incompetent and can not do there job proberly and as a result of this the suiside rate in healthcare professionals is greatly elevated in contrast to the genral population therefore i was interested to find out how people on here would feel about being cared for by someone with their own mental health problems
our 6 month old always has a smile on his face and loves to laugh it did not help my family did not like him either and he did not like my family
this study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088so all my life maybe after the age of 12 i have been alone
he does not understand or he just does not care though he is the only present parent in my life i have seen pics of them together and he seems genuinely happy
i feel i have hit a wall whilst i am doing better and the suicidal thoughts are gone i do not want to do anything
the moment he told me that it breaks my heart i tried to stay cool and not cry as i was packing up my stuff
i should be happy to be at my parents place but somehow this does not work for me the feeling remains
3 days ago i was in immense pain and wanted everything to endi recalled a podcast i heard with jordan peterson and wim hof the ice man
all i can do is sleep to avoid being conscious but that is starting to not be enough anymore could be a specific country or could be onlinecomplicated but easy at same time
how long am i supposed to stay like this my mother disowned me when i was 15 my dadbest friend died in 2018 my girlfriendfiance left me 9 months later i was with her for 5 years
i am concerned he is just not going to move and the longer he stays and acts like everything is fine the harder its going to be to get over him and move on with my life
it is not anxiety like i have been prescribed can someone help me because i genuinely feel crazy it is not something i can describe but i can try my best to elaborate in the comments
i am sorry i have disappointed everyone that i have known and metsomeone whgos not in my country i am really interested to told you
i am neurodivergent severely trauatized and i just can not get up on my own two feet alone and no one will help me i am constantly exhausted but unable to sleep in very intense pain dissociated and confused so maybe i am just better off dead
i am a pretty reserved personn i do not like sharing these kind of things plus with my depression i loose all confidence and tend to distance myself from others making me only more lonely and depressed
posting on here helps me think through things let us me get it all typed out on paper and the ability for you all to interact with it helps me see how it is perceived from people who are not me it is better than journaling in that aspect oh yeah and happy holidays everybody
2 days and she found them a shrink mean while 2 years i am still stuck in my head with worsening burnout fatigue and depression but i do not get help and it is clear that i am dying inside but i guess i have to suffer alone
it is been 10 months and you already moved on but i still cry like a baby i feel so pathetic and i certainly am
yes i have tried the little blue pills which have worked ok but you can not really keep that going in a relationship
while i lived with said hamster for about a year before moving out i was not that bothered about it nor particularly upset to hear it had died as it was not my pet so i did not have much to do with it
rather rebuild yourself from the ground up and work on attracting someone better someone mature and healthy and compatible someone worth your time
i would thought very carefully about what i wanted to say to her when she was here and was worried that she would not want to hear anything but to my surprise she actually listened to everything i had to say
i saw a post from a few days ago about searching for friends that got attention giving it my own shot i am 23f from europe feeling down recently but still have strength to make jokes dm me whenever you want
i woke up to him early in the morning throwing up over the side of the air mattress i was so upset
i have never been more low and suicide is growing as a solution each passing day they knew this as well and offered their heart to see me get myself on my feet
every talk about feelings impossible i am not alone but lonelyi am 18 that is a good age to die at i have no one everyone leaves i am killing myself goodbye
i hate that she can just throw three whole months out the window like it is nothing her last words being well i told you you fell in love with the wrong person
but still i thought i was getting over this girl but just seeing her face fucking killed me the only thing i deserve is to suffer and die i do not deserve presents
for as long as i can remember i never imagined that i would be here i never thought i would be able to fight for this long
but because of miscommunication and mostly my stupidity i have hurt her greatlyso i make a new account and tell her but i did change
i was devastated because i did not saw that coming we had communication issues because of the distance but was not expecting this
i feel like people get the impression that i already have a lot of friends and probably a lot going on in my life so they do not bother talking to me
i wish i could say this stuff my so they are just also struggling and i do not want them to be brought down by things i am worried about plus their own medicine
but you choose to not be there and i guess i will forever have to live with that fact and reality
i do not know what to do i can not tell my family because they will think i am crazy and saying it for attention
basically just hopeful songs or songs talking about mental health i thought people on here would know specifically because i am sure most people here have songs they listen to when their mental health gets hard any recommendations also here is the playlist link in case anybody wants to listen to it as i add more it just helps me get through
so yeah a part of me wants to break up and distance myself from him before it is too late another part of me wants to stay and be with him as long as i can until we break up get my hopes up and then get them crushed by harsh reality
i know some people will feel sad but i am not responsible for managing everyone is feelings i have taken a bunch of depression tests online and they all say i am not depressed either
they worked two shifts so i really never saw them often i did not had other close relatives either neither near where we lived nor my age or close
i want to replace his mother essentially to show what the perspective of loneliness is we are not alone and it should be understand by others
i just i just want to be gone it would not affect anything if i just disappeared the world still goes on and on one life less does not matter at all so why can not i just disappear
but it does not matter i do not care anymore and i am not doing so well specifically on the weeks when my daughter is not here
let us say it is emotional hurt you are saying i feel emotionally hurt i can not really move back home because i have a difficult relationship with my mum
i have been staying at home for a year now only gone out to buy food and that is it i can not even socialize it is like i forgot how to talk now
i do not want to live but i am afraid to diewhy did i have to play it and for that regard they did not do much
even at my lowest i used to have reasons why i would not now the reasons why i should vastly out weigh the reasons why i should not
now just check if you like the new person or not and if not just continue with the friends of the second person this time
i hate myself for many reasons and i am always desperately wanting someone at my side someone who can make me happy someone that can make me love myself and fix me just because i am not able to do it by myself
i know one day i will just wake up and be able to smile at the memories but be happy they are just that memories
the noise in stores and crowded isles overwhelm me and i feel claustrophobic it is the most hated thing i have to do i am at least thankful for self checkout and home delivery is not an option due to cost
then this morning i wake up and his response was i dunno what to say which kind of irritated me because it felt like he was not taking me seriously so i left him on seen
i have been hearing that he had been making out with girls and that he is fine you do not understand how much psychological pain and torment you have made me and brother go through
i want to take back control of my life i was not always like this i want to be free i had lost my phone that night so i checked my instagram and saw tons of messages
so this was born out of my ask the good death doula event last night it seemed one of the most poignant moments was the moment of silence when i held space for myself and the participants to feel grief for whatever and whomever they may be grieving in that moment
regardless if having him in my life i am still very unhappy with life it breaks my heart to leave him like this
i only had a crush for a girl who was also a dear friend of mine once and after 5 years of feeling that way i finally confessed and got rejected though it hurt me for some time i got over it and i see it as an important step i had to take in my life thanks to which i became open to other possibilities and ended up being in my first relationship shortly after
but i still struggle with my selfimage i do not hate myself anymore i worked really hard to overcome that but i still do not like myself
when i see happy couples it turns a big sharp blade inside of mei do not know if i could suceed i keep failing
i started planning to propose to her and then she broke up with me she blocked me on all social media but still will text me some times
2020 has easily been one of if not the hardest year of my life january i started dating a guy that i thought was good for me we dated for 7 months through the pandemic and in that time
like i want someone to notice me like a attention seeker a twofaced person i just wanted to make people happy and by being sad i have hurt everything around me
later in life i have come to realise that most people do not truly care about you and would just fuck you over
now it is been three days since and i have let her know if there is genuine change after a lot of space i would like a retry because the first part of the relationship was amazing
but recently they started talking to me less and less and in last three days i have got only one message a day
that all gradually got better over the past few months i started uni and met new friends for those who live by themselves what are you doing in this crappy situation
obviously there was so much more i could write but here you go thank you for taking your time to even read this
we went together in the same school it was close school for people after 7th grade and we started from 10th grade till 12th everytime we quarreled and make peace and it was over and over he used to jealous me to everyone so my social life was suck
i am always on a quest to prove to myself that he loves me more i got back and he was super dry with me over text oneword texts and things just felt
i hate that everyone assumes that if someone wants to die its because they hate how theyy look or they are getting bullied although those are the big causes it does not help when i am sitting with a friend and they say we love you for who your are and you are beautiful thanks for the support ik you mean well but you do not understand what i am going through and you are not helping
if she took a while to reply to my texts i would never get angry with her or mention it but i would check her other social medias religiously to see if she had been active there not to get angry or upset with her but because it made me feel like she was mad at me about somethingrejecting me even though that notion is entirely irrational
mostly for her she is in a home after a stroke and heart attack after liverkidney failureapp is coming soon so do not forget to sign up for updates
its so boring and repetitive money is the only thing that matters to everyone on this earthanyways to get to my point i hate the way i view things now
i know you should always get up when life knocks you down but surely there is a limt to how many times i can get back up cuz honestly i do not even want to get back up anymore
this is an old throwaways account i have because i ppl i know follow my real one also sorry for the bad english it is not my native language
it could be a significant other or just a friendi just want someone who thinks about me the invisible one the one that gets ignored
also started breathing heavily felt a little light headed and just felt very nervousanxious it probably lasted a minute or two
i realized i was not his first choice i will never be anyones first choice i am nothing but a backup and a doormat it would just feel nice to be on the front of someone is mind for once it feels lonely it is almost suffocating i do not want to live my life as a sidekick
replay the song from the beginning and continue to do so every time this happens until the negative emotions and thoughts stop the assault
i am absolutely petrified at the thought of running into her on a dating app in the near future and am afraid that this fear will keep me away from meeting new people she assured me that she has no plans to pursue a relationship in the near future but i have trouble believing this
when i finally did instead of enjoyment happiness satisfaction fulfillment joy i wanted to fucking kill myself my thoughts were awesome let me walk out of the window to celebrate that yaaaaaaaaay
i know it may sound bad or weird but i am more alone now being married then when i was single i am missing something i had
this led some people to think what so happened in their life so far and in additionally this led a mad person like me to think more about time
for the first few weeks of taking the medication i actually felt like i was recovering i was not having multiple panic attacks per day my dpdr was just slight occasional i had energy to do stuff the energy that i have not had for the past few months
because i am codependent she is the best nicest kindest girl i have ever met in my life who would do anything for me i was her world i loved her and she loved me
this was going on well before the pandemic i have never been much of a joinersorry for everyone i have ever made feel badangryupset i did not mean too
that is why i am going to never talk to anyone anymore unless i am required to speak ever again i just need to be punished and left alone so i will not ever hurt anyone again
and now i was in contact with someone who tested positive my boss said no i was not because i was not there the day of that she got her positive test back but i was with them at work the day before they got their positive test result and i have been having a slight temp for three daysbrain fog and on and off cold symptoms but i am still expected to come to work even though i might have it
he just did it to let me know that he appreciates my time and he just wants a fresh start bc he is guilty
another sign i should just forget him move on but i can notbut you manage to wake up today and function i applaud you applaud the little things
it overscores an overt message of a delusional outlook on what is considered to be good i guess i kind of take that as further proof that i am not meant to be here
i have been self harming since i was 12 my legs are covered my arms in tatters i have the ones on my left arm covered with a tattoo but i just self harm on the front of my arm instead i have had anxiety for as long as i can remember
if someone would be kind enough to give me any advice or maybe explain why i am doing this i would be very appreciative
i do not understand what is wrong with me why people do not even spend a couple of words to explain why they want to cut me off i have read multiple times the conversations with those people and i do not see anything that annoying about my behaviour and in case there is i still deserve an explanation
i do not want to get older i am scared of being alone getting older might mean i am closer to moving away from my father but part of me wants to stay
i spent all of high school in absolute isolation because of my fear and bitterness of people ugh i do not know and i hate how much i am over thinking this
i was not expecting a reply and when i got a reply i cried i allowed myself to feel through my emotions initially whilst figuring out what had made me cry i thought it was sadness made me wonder if the sadness be from his short unfazed and neutral response with no apology on his end
i have not spoken to him since and i am not sure what to make of it does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this
my gf 16 just broke up with me 16m because she needs to work on her anxiety is it possible to get back together
i feel so bad about this situation because it made me go from a relatively good person to a bad person
i am not suicidal but definitely fancy suicide as an option if shit hits the fan but every suicide method i have been reading about does not seem to have a decent success rate and i see people saying that you can potentially end up fucking up your body and being in a worse position than before your attempt
it felt good to finally she would tears when i could not for so long but i miss how things were between us
life simply just is not for everyone i am glad i understand this nowi am just waiting for my grandmother to pass then i can set myself free
it really felt like we were made for each other like in the moviesi do not know what to do or who to talk to or how to feel anymore
but then is not that just what a friendship is i start to freak out sometimes i will blow her phone up i will tell her i know she is cheating
she went off to college in september and things were going good i should have called more but i can not go back now
i have been broken up with my girlfriend for about 2 12 months now it was kind of a mutual break up but she wanted it to end more than i did
now remind you i walked in wearing vans knee socks shorts a black shirt my other attire included skinny jeans and jordans and just stuff i did not see anyone wearing
she was okay with it when i told her but as soon as i went on the trials like she always does she expressed her disagreement with my decision
she said it was all the work she has to do she feels like she is not got time for it she does not want to make things bad between us cos she still cares about us and does not want to add unwanted stress
graduated with flying colors still no friends no relationships made hated every second of my school life i am not going to grow up happy my life is a failure
although it was not a relationship it still hurts and feels like it was and i do not know where to go from here feels like i have lost a friend on top of a potential life partner
now she and i have already promised to first meet on october of 2020 but since it was a special occasion and we could forward our first encounter i jumped into the idea and told her i would go stay with her i choose to abandon festivities with my family to go see her that is just how important she was for me
fuck these people fuck my family fuck school i just want the tender love of my fictional husbands near me i want to be coddled nonstop and treated how i wanted _ life fucking sucks and i hope they become real everyone seems more positive and happyer then me
i tried everything going out finding hobbies meeting people even therapy but the feeling of void hopelessness loneliness will not go away i keep trying to think of a purpose a way to find some meaning in myself try not to feel like an outsider like there is someone out there that might be like me just to talk to and then i can feel that i am not completely alone in this world
i know i was a girl i would not be accused of having a demon in me because i would just be a regular teenage girl in a relationship
we shared a deep emotional intimacy together and it felt really special she told me how much she appreciated me as a person and that she was not going anywhere
happiness is so fleeting and out of touch for me it is been this way since i was around 9 years old
that also makes me a horrible hypocrite because i am angry at her for saying mean shit but i do the same thing in response
235httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat155s is it not too deep a topic for christmas 428httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat268s what about the leftover days when people are no longer around
i really want it to be over i do not want help anymore this is it i am going to remind myself of this everytime i feel like i want him back
anyway i started feeling nauseous and i felt this huge anxiety come over me it is brought back a lot of bad memories and before all this i was doing ok but now i can not even sleep without having bad dreams
one of that is i expect my friends would choose me over convenience as i would very much do it for them
my question is would it be inappropriate to reach out to their dad who they have in the past been open about their mental health with and who i have met several times in person just to say something like hiya i have been receiving some messages from julia lately and am just a bit concerned about the content
seeing my parents so hurt all of this going down within the span of five hours does anyone know any ways to help get over a relationship that is over
i am looking to discuss some topics with people who suffer from a variety of mental health as i feel discussing and talking to each other is really the key forward
my ex has a habit of coming into and out of my life yesterday he accused me of trying to hack him i did not and he had no proof
over a year ago i broke up with my boyfriend after he cheated on me things had been bad since the year started but i did not leave right away a fault on my part i had read somewhere that good relationships require a lot of forgiveness and that is what i was applying when things became unbearable i had no other choice but to walk away from the relationship
my sister was supposed to visit in january and i had long since had plans to go to the jewelry store where she used to work and pick out a ring of course she does not know that
idk what to do i know i am not the only one feeling this way but i am sick of not having friends
i did not mean to make you feel sad or helpless i just do not know what to do anymore everything is just so hard and i can not really talk to anyone about this
its at this juncture i begin to despise pretty much everyone and everything i could not in my wildest dreams imagine life being this goddamned cruel i thought i would get another year with him instead i got a middle finger
this is coming from someone who was point blank shocked to be dumped so take this to the bank do some work on yourself trust a close friend to be the friendly ear for ya work on yourself some more and hit repeat socially distant air hug
it befuddles me how this usually kind hearted grown man cannot take the initiative and tidy up or cook a meal
i have spent the last year wishing that my ex would want me back and i have no hopes goals or motivations in life i do not ever want to work i dislike people i dislike everything
its like it turned a switch in my brain you do not fucking joke around about that shit i talk to people on omegle to take up my time i write letters to my ex fiancee
that never happened we had sex many times during our time together first off i do not even know what i am talking anymore i just feel awful
i get that i have to be heartbroken sad i get that i deserve to feel betrayed and used and disposable
idk how to live for myself idk what my own story is it is just a messi will try and tell my story to the best of my ability
he tells me it is fine but i do not believe him i can not believe him and other scientific things to help with my situation
i have heard it many times that children have imarinary friends and it is totally normal but i have never heard about adults having imaginary friends
my mother on the other hand i am very comfortable around and we talk about a lot of things and is really the person that i spend the most time with
personally my favourite breathwork techniques are box breathing and wim hof breathing i do wim hof every morning while taking a cold shower which wakes me up in the morning and makes me feel like i am ready to crush the day i use box breathing at night or whenever i just want to chill out calm my mind or ground myself
thing is the jeans are not skin tight and are considered normal for majority of people clothes represent who i am and i can not be who i am with parents who think like this
since then i have been trying to remade my life but it is been to hard she hurted me so much i can not even breakdown at home because it sets him off which is causing me so many health issues
i am also worried society will not accept me for who i am and if i choose a gender i may want to switch again
i want nothing more than for her to stay but i know if she stayed we would be right back here in another week
just then getting this strong shivery shot of cold blood from your heart into your left arm and all the way to your hand while also feeling an almost completely empty and energyless void in the middle of your chest which makes you feel terrible about your situation but at the same time phisicaly and psichologically feeling so good while letting a tear go through your quiet and dry face peacefully drip into the sheets on your bed lol
i just keep crying but i do not think it has hit me yet my partner of 5 years decided to do a soft break up they were both my best friend and my beloved and i can not imagine my life without them
to anyone who reads this thank you i hope that by passing on your knowledge it makes you feel good i appreciate you
i have struggled with depressive tendencies and issues with relationships for a lot of years i have finally nailed down the source of these issues but i do not know what to do with this information
i have social anxiety and depression and would love to see a therapist but fear my family would make fun of me and reject it
and all these bad thoughts bombarding my head is just too much and i do not know what to do other than ask for help which i do not think i can do yet mainly because first i will have to admit it to someone
i was home alone all day today but each time i went to get up and get it i just ended up sitting back down
i am autistic but at least in theory i have a big iq i do not have problems finding jobs or doing things that many people can not
it happened so gradually i did not realize it all felt like she was the longsuffering one staying with me even though i did not deserve it
why did not you tell me this sooner instead of leading me on for weeks or months she still wants to be friends and called me a great guy but all i could think and say then is if i am such a great guy why are you breaking my heart
i was there people just disagreed with her that is it she thinks that everything is abuse and assault and it is clearly not
is this the stigma that people talk about that people with mental health issues or psychological issues get because i think it is
no matter what i did the abuse was front and center pretty much every single day of my life it got to the point where i had lost 40lbs and was literally wasting away
we have been long distance for a bit but it was never that that got in the way if it was we would have ended it sooner
i am not naive or too gullible to agree on everything that they say since a lot of them do care highly of their status
yeah i guess i kind of want to know how others do it like i am aware that it is probably very different for every person but maybe you still have some advice
i know it hurts i know but i promise there is a light at the end of the tunnel i looked up and she was getting ready to leave
like i either feel sad or i feel nothing life seems so different everything has changed for me this post became much longer than i intended since it is very hard to explain this problem without rambling sorry
when i see people with my same type of opinions i start feeling terrible like the line between me and them starts to get blurry like i am not original
help always tells me it is my perspective it is my perception maybe i should just smile and take it like they want me too
is it cheating if he talked to girls you said not to talk to and called them bb even tho you made it clear it made you uncomfortable and then right when you broke up asked her out feels sus to me
tldr i think i may be going down the road to a very serious mental illness but i do not know what it is
i tried but could never find the reasons i dealt with rumours and jokes about her at school which pulled me down again
we were on our 8 year anniversary riding a ferris wheel into the night sky surrounded by stars and beautiful lights
my region is going into lockdown for 2 weeks and i know that it is not just going to be two weeks
in the box was the stuff i sent her including the compass and a few things of mine she had found that i had forgotten to take
we hope to be friends afterwards but i have been having second thoughts about whether i even want to be friends with him anymore
i just want to end this spiral and also maybe get proper help besides just finding the closest psychiatristso my cousin lives with mania and bipolar disorder
but i can not kill myself because i can not put my family through the same pain i went though with my best friend i would literally kill them ruin their lives and destroy my whole family
he said there were underlying problems that he was ignoring that i honestly had no idea about so this came out of nowhere we essentially went from perfect to broken up in under a week
sad because i miss them and wish they could have continued i teach esl in a private cram school so sick pay does not exist
sometimes i want to hurt myself and break everything around me when i feel this way others i need to be high
but i still feel and am constantly shown that i am undesirable as fuck like the only thing i am worth is fucking
and i know who to trust with theese things but even do i can talk about my feelings to many of my friends i just do not feel that they truly understand me
i was unfaithful after a night out at the bar very early in our relationship after that situation happened we have lots of trust issues with each other
fuck this world see you on the other sidei have so many things to do nice things actually last month i cut ties with all my family i have finally gotten a new doctor after over 15 years
but i picked up the pieces with the help of an amazing person that showed me not everyone was the way my ex was
like i was not completely ignored but my parents stopped having the time for actually spending time with me and learning about the kind of person i was becoming as i was growing up
most of my friends think i am just a serial crash dieter but my housemates who i cook have definitely noticed since for the last year we have all worked from the home and they see how much i vary my portion sizes
i sometimes think it is me but then again why would not it be right the young me for sure would not have given it a thought
it was something she wanted so badly from me before we lost contact but i was not in a place to relate
it is been years since my brother was moved to a mental facility and it is been years since i first started breaking down
it sounds so silly even saying it but i had the feeling that we were meant to be that he is the one i have waited all my life for
one thing i wonder is if i should send my ex a message i still do not understand anything about the kids and ex wife
it is too late though i can not understand why he was so ugly to me today and so angry he decided this
but when i really think about it she was not much of a friend and a shitty partnerrecently i ran into an old friend from school at a supermarket
you must have a new guest over because last week you let me come upstairs and you kissed me back
thanks for reading everyone best wishes to you all what are the best ways to keep evolving your mind and brain even after finishing highschool or faculty
this was about 2 weeks ago i have been on an emotional roller coaster ever since the first 3 days i literally cried non stop i could hardly go to work without bursting into tears
now i am inclined to make her pay i just see no other wayi am not sure how reddit works so i hope i am doing this right but anyways
i truly feel like i am an unlovable person who will never have anyone to be happy withas the title says i feel like i come across people who usually tend to bore me
i feel like i do not want to do anything i literally do not have any will to do even my hobbies i kind of feel lost and can not focus on something for a long time
they serve no purpose than to remind me of how alone i ami know i will probably die alone do not need a week set aside to be reminded of that
i do not want to be here if fate do not want me to be happy i want to feel like i have a reason to live again
been feeling quite lonely lately the loneliness is heavy and i have been finding it hard to get on with work
staying at home crying about someone who clearly does not care about your existence is such a bad idea i hope someday i would forgive what he is done
the answer seems obvious but i still think that i am faking it to make excuses just to be lazy and on the outside i look like i am doing completely fine but in the inside i am a mess
here is the thing today i woke up and i felt a little bit of panic what if he gets in a relationship with this girl and it is too late for us did i mess up not meeting with him sooner when he reached out at first one thing is for sure a lot of feelings came back after seeing him
i think it is a question of selfishness and becoming an individual and letting go of the notions of shouldrightwrong but idk how to do that
everything just got proven to be so again by 16 i was taking care of my mom and the whole house
he was the first time i have ever felt complete even in sorrow and every day i pick up the pieces of myself and cling to my sides trying to hold it together alone
i am so so so tired i have learned to not expect anything from others my partner loves me very much they keep me going but i wish i had the capacity to love them back i feel guilty for relying on them i can not expect anything because i have to force myself to expectations are so draining
all i know is if she moves in i am done times are hard enough with what is happening in the usa and world
no one deserves to feel the hurt of a broken heartwhy do people always say exes always come backi sincerely hope you the best and want you to be happy you deserve it
i am planning to go out to dinner with my family tonight outdoors same as every year just doing something with my family
i just want to lie down and die and have everything about me wiped from the earth so no one has to be burdened by cleaning up after i kill myself
i did not have any friends for so many years 5 years now because i had to focus on my career medicine and that got away with my time and energy
i honestly have no idea where i am going with this but i wish someone had told me this when i was heartbroken
who to share they say you have your friends right butthey are not that best friend that love that soulmate who i lost
since i just learned about the boy scout thing i am curious since he does not really have any vices like drugs or booze or cigs or coffee tho he does gamble and take risks and buys so much crap he does not need it ends up in storage rotting away since he never maintains anything he buys he chases pussy non stop i can see now and why
i have been thinking about taking my own life more and more frequently especially this year and to be honest the only reason i have not is because of my friends
and it is not even the fake friends these are really good people genuine friends who care yet i can not feel anything
i get sick and loose around a month in bed every time because i can not do anything else but rest and try to recover all full of medicine and injections
he is come to terms with accepting now that he needs help and has been seeing a counselor for about 6 months now
this is a long story i do hope someone does care enough to take the full time to read it and sympathize with either of us so i can understand myself and her better
i cannot stop thinking about her we broke up four months ago and it is really not getting any better i still miss her so much i shiver when i hear her name and i am currently swimming in a sea of thoughts and wishes of being with her i miss her kisses hugs and every moment we spent together
i was never in an officially relationship with my best friend we slept together for two years secretly and we were essentially a couple but whenever i wanted to move things forward he did not want to and whenever he wanted to move things forward i was not ready
she said yes and that she was just way out later than she said she was going to be for some reason my
i have been alone most of my life i have family but i do not really interact with them ya know they do not really care i have no friends and i do not exactly know how to find any actually i think i have a friend but it is more of a work relationship i like her but i do not think the feeling is mutual in that regard
no one cared about me everyone was like having inside references i felt so ignored no one would listen to me i felt so boring alienated and unwanted
i wish i could see her outside of work i wish she was comfortable with that but she is noteach day i wish this fing cycle ends
can not keep getting up everyday just to realize how lonely i am done with constant rejections denials ignorance but i hate doing it
why do i feel regret and scared everytime i talk to other guys even tho we broke up 5 months ago after 3 years rsand he moved on with someone new immediately
my brain is a trash fire that will never get betteri am on so many medications i have done so much therapy nothing is working
when your lover left you she 99 of the time already fell out of love way before she cut the cord or before you called it quits
which i tried to re assure her we would not be living in the city she also said she wants someone who would make sure she goes to church every weekend
this is hilarious i have been practically fantasizing about killing myself for the past year i do not even know what to do now i feel like i am walking down on the price is right or something just caught off guard but not unhappy
side note i know that that is genuinely not okay i have no good excuse for why i still had them i was being a bit of a pig and i reconciled by using bit defender to shred any remaining photos i would have as well as purging my facebook dms with every contact to make sure the change was irreversible
i have trouble remembering my memories from just a few months ago like biking with friends i do not have the money to meet with a private psychologist because they cost around 200 an hour
my grandpa was so understanding and when i went upstairs he tried to make me laugh and he actually sided with me over his own son saying that had my grandma not been so happy with her son being there he would have let my dad kick my uncle out in order for me to enjoy christmas
1 we made some explicit tapes together and he said he is never done it with anyone else a lie he is done it with multiple people
i would just be her back up she did not care about me in a relationship so why would she in a friendship and i would just be an emotional tool for her to use whenever she needed someone to talk to
and apparently he wanted to study architecture too but took civil in the same university as me because he could not get a seat
both my family and my ex have told me to go die and i feel so fucking betrayed but oh well
selflove is probably the most important thing we should be keeping in mind whether we are in or out of a relationship
i can see that all you need is everything i will never bemerry christmas to anyone that can manage to somehow enjoy it
we end up breaking up before our anniversary because things was not going well between us took it as maybe we just need a break from each other
he just blamed me for everything that i ever said made him feel bad that way we can depend on each other
i am 17 always grew up with close friendship groups and had 2 best friends until i moved cities i still would have to own up to it myself
i would give anything to be able to unmeet people so i can just remove myself to stop continuing to not only bring pain to myself but to others
it still made me wonder what if she is talking to other guys because if she moves so fast with me who is to say she is not doing it with other guys behind my back too
he is bipolar and now with covid extremely compulsive over the pandemic this last year has grown more violent he just recently had a violent outburst and threw furniture my brother wanted to come down on christmas eve and he grew angry that my parents would want to see their child
i do not really know how to get over this i want to work on myself but it is hard during these times because i can not go to the gym because of covid and i can not throw myself into work because i can not land a job anywhere
i started tracking negative thoughts in my journal so maybe my new therapist can help me figure out the triggers right now
i am in a such worry to get everything clean and in the right place because the ideia of not be alive by the 25th is growing on me
i still feel incredibly guilty about calling the police though which i should i also just kind of want my dog home i had to rehome him and it is been killing me
one note about this girl she is much younger than me i am the oldest in the group and she is the youngest of the group of her friends and while i adore every one of them i often complained with my ex about the immaturity of this young girl
i now see all my problems like low self esteem lack of self discipline anxiety depression and anything else comes from how i grew up
anyway i am lonely i can not seem to bring myself to talk to anyone or get close to them when it comes to potential love interests a certain thought runs through my head
i have recently wanted to try things like dating apps or something i think if i had a partner lined up i would be ok with leaving
we had been dating for about 4 years she cheated on me at some point and i never forgave her i never really hid my emotions about it either from that point i never really cared about her she was really insecure and jealous about everything
i really just want to be dead because i failed everything i started tho i am really intelligent and interested in many topics like physics philosophy etc on a pretty high level
i did not talk to her for almost 2 ½ years and then there she was telling me that she may have caught feelings for me as she was my first love now it is been almost 34 weeks she is mostly offline we hardly talk on call even when we do it is for a short period she says that her mom is making her do house chores
it was the first time that someone told me that even despite all my flaws that person would be willing to stand by me and offer a helping hand in times of need
edit and sometimes i just make really weird connections for example once a friend of mine sent me a pic of cookie dough with chocolate chips and my first instinct was to say they were olives i do not even know why that is just what my mind went to automatically
for any of you who are struggling do not worry this is not one of those it will get better posts because i do not know if it gets better but what i do know is that the fight gets a little easier the more you do it so just fucking fight with all you have
you can not win your ex back and you can not trick her into coming back and every time you try to it only pushes her farther away from you that is the bottom line
at seeing my try my hardest for human connection where am i anymore idk just kill me already i can not believe i am never going to see him again never going to speak to him ever again
those words stuck with me but i could not control myself to make things worse one of my cousins encouraged me to do it
this year i happened to become closer to a girl and her girlfriend we have been in touch nearly every day during the quarantine and after i came back to my hometown she and her girlfriend organised a surprise party for my birthday i was so happy with them

i am looking to start a youtube channel that would be discussing not only my own experiences and advice that is helped me throughout the years but also show the bad days and how to overcome or get through them as best as we possibly can
she has lupus and my mother has multiple sclerosis so i have at least two in my family that are immunocompromised
i think the part with the extra groups bothers me but i can not change that if they decided to do so
i feel grossed out by the idea of being touched and i do not want to date anymore maybe this one is actually justified this happened on december from last year
i self harm for no reason other then to release the emotional pain that i feel my life has become nothing and i have no future ahead of me
it really hurt me that he acted so reserved and unemotional during the entire conversation was it just because he felt awkward or was he really not feeling anything he said sorry a lot
people do not usually choose their partners to make children rationally nobody can choose what to love how id drop everything for you
gone forever3 days grace probably my favorite i played this song over and over until i really started to believe i feel so much better now that you are he is gone forever seriously helps the mood
that is it that what i learned from my past relationship i know it sounds stupid to generalize but it feels this way and what better than make strangers read
towards me and every time really he acts like the victim i like to workout do boxing and cardio and i would rather save my energy for that lol
so i was wondering is friendship that important or is it overrated i am craving her i am craving her love her attention her texts her voice her touch
and when i am alone and do something i always compare unwantedly and thoughts like i am so good at this no one can do this like me keep repeating and it is just so hard to get through a day
i try not to check up on you but your name is always in my search bar with something new always happening that i would have never known elsewhere
today i had enough she was angry because his boyfriend was playing videogames with friends she went to the sofa where i was sitting and told me to get off or she would hit me i sit up and went in my room i took a 5kg dumbbell with the intent of hitting her as hard as i could in the head with it
i cannot forgive someone who has taken from me hurt me is gloating and taunting mei made another post regarding my breakup story already so i will not go over that again
the problem is i literally cannot do this i cannot form an isolation cell with my friends if i do not have any of those in the first place breaking the group is the only way such a thing would ever be open to me it literally is the only way and now it is not possible anymore until it is over which is how long things are being canceled well into the summer
if you have a set of core values that you serve and defend then you have what is called a foundation this is your anchor this will guide you forward
it never gets better as some people say suicide for me would not be slitting my throat i do not like pain and i do not want to die
for example if you are physically connected to someone it may be easier to move on from them but if you were physically and mentally connected to someone then it maybe a little harder to disconnect
in any case our relationship was fine though we were planning to move and study together in england any thoughts please
having the same meaningless days on repeat there is no point anymore i have a knife at my neck ready to go
at school i never felt joy and i am the top 5 student of my class but i never felt any improvement i am always doing the same thing wrong and tutor never helped me
i am just tired i am sick of not being allowed to sleep my anxiety and shyness have gotten the best of me i cry myself to sleep many nights
i have an ex i miss dearly and i would only have a chance again in years i want to move on now so i can find something better or be in a better state if i take that chance what are some good tips to heal and get over a break up with someone that you had a very deep bond with
i feel stupid for thinking this was a genuine person who actually cared about how i am feeling i feel dumb for replying and thinking a conversation would start
i came to find out through her directly that she went out with him on 3 dates and made out with him
i honest to god loved her deeply enough to wsnt to stay friends and now i am filled with so much anger and resentment that i hope she gets used as a human cum dumpster until she breaks her own heart looking for love from men who want nothing but a place to stick their dicks
however i have random pains through my fingers and my back just did two cbcs one in ae and one in my gp surgery and both came back perfectly fine
like i will just be trying to go to get and some horrific out of no where thought will show up in my head and just play on repeat
about a year ago it happened again with a korean girl who wanted money and sex from me i had refused sex saying maybe later but i bought her things for the time being

i know math is a good thing to practice learning a new skill reading and physical exercising as well what are other things one should do to keep their mind sharp and even develop it further
i am so used to being by myself that it actually feels strange if i actually talk to a person now i feel like i am slow and i have to remember how to socialize again for me it actually feels good and i realize damn i really need to be connected to people it really does affect your well being
so dying is always on my mind i am just painfully devoid of the ability to feel genuinely happy it all feels so hollow and flat i do not even really feel like a real person anymore nothing is worth it but i do not know why it is all just so heavy and there are not any clear answers to make it make sense
i feel better writing this maybe it is just my body clock and seeing all my friends having their own families my girlfriend does not know how she feels about having children but she has been wonderful helping me through this

this years catholican christmas marks our 10th anniversary without a single smallest particle of a planck time of even slightly not loving her back then i foolishly thought that life is a gift and back then i also did not really believe in that blanc might actually become real one day only now this belief not being able to be anything more than a mere belief increases my infinite purest suffering

i am not going to be a lawyer like my brother or a real estate broker like my older brother in fact i feel like i am going to fade away and be nothing
people do not understand that it is not a choice and that i am in great pain i had depression when i was younger sometimes i was in a mental hospital and other stuffs
we had communication problems and some other stupid issues but the relationship was beautiful atleast for me we broke up 2 months ago he moved on but i am still there

my family have to keep a close eye on me my brother wants me to go work for him but i am not well enough to do it
was a good relationship for a time 3 years dating then on the 13th of may 2013 while we was on holiday vacation for everyone else i popped the question on a stage of a show we was seeing while they was on a break luckily the person running the show was a friend of mine
he would tell me that my depression is not a problem to me but i am always overthinking that he will get tired of me because of my depression
i feel like i am going insane and losing my mind like i am convinced we are soulmates but he just does not see it
look for ways to improve your life quality do the thing you were so afraid to do before do not try finding a rebound just to numb the pain it does not work
i am married but my husband is just doing his own thing he grieves different and is not present or available to me at all
as funny as that might sound it shows the irony of pursuing someone i knew i was a kind person and i did not intend for people to think of me that way
so i arrived at his parents house hoping he would be there however i did not wake the house because i literally just met them the other day so i do not know what type of people they are and i am worried about doing something because i have a record not to mention i am brown and he is white
if you are willing to you could even turn the anxious feeling into a feeling of excitement to try out what you plan on doing
apparently i made quite a few of the women uncomfortable but i hate the feeling of losing a boyfriend and a best friend i need to stop texting him
i had depression when i was younger sometimes i was in a mental hospital and other stuffs but even the doctors are not understanding and makes me suffer even more

my parents encourage me to rejoin school so that i will have funding but the imposter syndrome is really bad and whenever i think about writing my extant papers from last year i start to cry and shake
this world will be much better if i was not here everyday is a constant struggle not to end it but i keep going because my sister is my last thread that i am hanging on i am so sick of this shit
i am trying to hold into my sanity while doing any kind of activity to fill my schedule and i thought to myself why not spend this time for a good because a group activity that not just help me and whoever might join me but also be useful for people in general
about a month ago i realized i was not nearly as sad i did not think of him so often i did not get sad at the thought of him
i think the world would not notice if i died so it is okay for me to goi know she does not want to be with me and never will
i did not want to cry in front of him i know you are happy without me so i will try to be happy for you
sometimes i wonder am i even alive if this is valhalla as i fight the lessor war as life a battle for the glory of surviving day after day
but i can not handle it in myself it sometimes makes me go full blown panic mode i tried smoking my mind away but the dreams still happen
i think i was happy to feel useful again i was able to be a bit more honest with some people
hi i am fairly new here but i want to ask if anyone knows any solution to my problem i have been feeling empty for few weeks and it is really a struggle for me
my situation is a little bit complicated i broke up with her around february but the ultimate breakup of our relationship happened almost 3 months ago me and this girl started talking again by the beginning of august
am i wrong for not wanting to be seen as only a toolhelp always tells me it is my perspective it is my perception
is this something i should talk to my psychiatrist about is it not a mental thing and more of a different health thing
in certain situations i can get overloaded and will sometimes lie on the floor if i am at home or just zone out and stare off into space partially listening to my surroundings but not responding to them because i neither want to nor feel able to
at some point i have to drop off his christmas presents i am poor and i start my holiday shopping in july
i just really need advice as to what to do do i stop being friends with him do i distance myself i just really want to stop being so anxious all the time and so dependent on these two guys
is it the need of full acceptance as who they really are is it to avoid such dire pain to endure in life
she said that she was going to take in slow and easy just chill and think for a while we then cuddled and had fun giving me hope she knew what she was doing
i read somewhere that having pcos does not just mean infertility problems it makes us depressed gives us intrusive thoughts and increases anxiety
when people tell me to get my life together as a solution to anxiety it feels like they are laughing at me from their stable lilo judging me for not trying harder to float
of 2020 around may i reconnect with him and tried to confess what was going on at that moment and what i was going thru in 1819 and it seems like it was working and it was getting better
but it did not do anything for my mental health one good week i got 5lbs lower than my average low fluctuation i was eating super healthy and getting plenty of exercise and i felt good about myself but the high from it died quickly
but now i do not regret having those thoughts i was right about that guy and the danger i was thinking he represented for the relationship
since the lockdown started i live in switzerland my mental health has been terrible and i do not know what to do about
but when i broke up with my partner he got mad and sent me death threats during that time i was terrified i cried i was shaking i could not sleep straight etc
she said she feels like she has to be carefull what she says to me because she does not want to give me hope she does not want to be in a possition to break my heart even further
i slept ok for a while but woke up in the middle of the night i felt the trembles coming so i asked my mom if i could sleep in bed with her

merry christmas to everyone who celebrates and i hope that everyone is hanging in there with whatever they are going through i am sure that everyone of us is struggling in one way or another so i hope that the days are easy on everyone is hearts and minds
everyone would say hi to me everyone knew who i was i had a group of friends but i felt so fucking lonely
i will give you a few short examples of what i mean maybe that could help you a little to understand what i am trying to explain
i am letting down every one who actually believes in me i cry uncontrollably do not think of me erase me from your mind you heartless bitch
you sent me multiple messages over the last couple of days such as yesterday she realized that i deleted my snapchat and she thought that i deleted her but why would she care if that was the case it has been about a month since we actually talked or anything and from what i can see she is extremely happy with her new boyfriend
to be honest i still find more and more things to hate my ex about each day but hating him is only harming me so as of today i will no longer be angry i choose to forgive him for my sanity and my peace
i really want to believe that he is not still trying to preserve that relationship but i can not keep the bad thoughts away that he would actually rather be with her
she said she was 100 sure she still wanted to be friends with me but i can not say i am sure of that right now just because of the heartbreak and emotions she has caused me over the last couple of months
i want to get some info on this mental disorder because i am experiencing the same symptoms and want to know if i can do something for myself
what kind of absolute loser is that pathetic and unaware do you know how unappealing of a person you have to be for someone that just months prior was so excited for our future together and called you the love of his life to just lose interest in the blink of an eye what a complete fucking loser i am so tired of living to just feel this pathetic and worthless
from counselling in a high school to talking with people on twitch playing video games and just generally being myself and making peoples days all well applying for a new job
i tried so hard to finish school and i failed i could not keep a job because i call in too much from pain
suicide for me would not be slitting my throat as i always say the one thing i am looking for in a person
i feel like i am close to my breaking point every day is just the same and everythings blending together and i can not be asked to do anything
my 18m gf 17f have been dating since high school but once i graduated things started feeling off now she has not spoken to me for 2 weeks other than now just to say bye high school was my only opportunity to see other people and i am afraid i will never move on can i get some advice
she had a daughter about 1 years old who i looked after and took care of and she called me daddy
sorry did not mean to vent but i find myself slipping back into depression every day and its fucking terrifying i know he would love being one too and i have taken that away from him
i did not have much of a choice because it was this or be homeless i do not do well confined to small spaces personally
for nights i could not sleep i was doing poorly in school when it started and some fun activities i was supposed to do like go to my first concert or the first day of sophomore year
doing my best to deal with the emotion as best as possible i have talked to friends and i feel ok for a moment
it is time to listen to your advice and listen to others stop being so undeniably difficult that it mentally breaks you down
we have a dog together so that is one of the reasons i do not want to let go i do not know how to feel anymore
the general relationship n and i had was that we offered each other companionship i made dumb jokes and she showed me stuff she liked on the internet between bouts of belittling my own interests and using me as a punching bag
the police turned up at my door last night and my ex tried to get me into trouble only it is backfired as they have found out he is breached his bail
i have been suffering for too long and i do not want to suffer any longerhe is on bail for harassment and has recently messaged me
i am not sure if my mood is affected by the weather and this is causing this but there are times when i feel ok that everything looks brighter like i am literally looking at the bright side
the ones i really loved are gone or left me i hate being depressing and mopy but this loneliness has been here since i was a kid
however i have never seen her ask how things are going or how is his ocd i feel as though i have made great progress but am obviously not healed entirely
but i would like to know if the fear of having somebody else take your place in life and not being able to do anything about it as everyone else thinks your crazy as you try
i should have gone to america where i could have bought a gun and i wish i shot myself so that they do not ever have to bear the pain of me being their son
she was endlessly encouraging she was inspirational she was the yin to my yang however from about the start of this year it is just taken over me
5 am too intelligent hence its difficult to connect and am picky about my friend or prospective girlfriend choices 6 girls think am too innocent used to be a nerd
when the day finally came she opened it after work but was too tired to talk about it the next day she phoned me and we had a brief 8minute call about the letter
this was my first relationship since my exfiancee cheated on me circa 2018 atleast when that one ended i understood what was happening
i just want to give her peace of mind i know she will be devastated to lose me but at least she will know that it is over
i am posting this since there is no were else i can ask anonymously and get answers with many people viewing it i will go to a therapist but imagine being a therapist and listening to me say these things you would think i am crazy i much rather have a name of an illness going into this
embarrassed and ashamed i quietly replaced the workcovered laptop with an identical model with my own money and have now spent 400 on a 200 machine
anyway they somehow got my mums number and whatsapped her i read the message this morning they made me sound like an annoying 8 year old
i lost 2 years in my university engendering not being able to do any exams i could not go to lessons for a form of moderate social anxiety and that was the beginning of the end
near our end she had gotten into an emotional relationship with another guy and i finally got some closure to that as she told me recently that she did that because she needed care from someone who does not really know her and she could just feel less pressure explainingexpressing what she was going through
first of i want to thank you when me 28f and my ex 34m broke up this march after a 3 year relationship this sub helped me enormously at first i made all the rookie mistakes covid19 just hit us and we where both lonely and still talked a lot after that i set really clear boundaries and went nc and surprise surprise he missed me and wanted to meet up
it is really barbaric and backwards that we congratulate and even thank people for their service for them murdering people but at the same time judge ridicule and dehumanize sexworkers like their pieces of garbage and subhuman
i currently visit a chatroom everynight to cope and it takes a lot of pain away from me its nice to talk to others in the chatroom but we never get to continue our friendship
throughout the call i was crying and he did too sometimes but when it ended we were both really crying and it just hurts and confuses me so much
i know people love me and care about me but it honestly might be easier for me to not be around
you guessed wrongi live in a metropolis and i am not elderly at allnot much to say i just wanted to say hello
even back then i would wonder how people with so much potential could turn out so regular or worse and i am an example of it
in the end it just was not right i had to make the decision and call it to give us both a shot at real happiness down the road i am 100 sure i am doing the right thing but goddammit i can not stop crying i just want to fast forward to the part where i wake up one morning and realize it does not hurt quite so much anymore
i know i was not crying because i was upset or sad that i fought with my mother i think it was because i was stressed as i cry when i am feeling that way
if you need a distraction or a little empowerment as you heal you can download the ebook below i hope it helps 3 here is to your healing cheers
i feel mortified to show them to her because i do not know what her reaction would be i cannot sleep eat or anything
but part of my wants it to blow up in her face because i feel so awful and how badly she treated me at the end
i ended up moving to chicago and getting away to have a fresh start it took me about 34 months up there to truly get over her
i have given up my hopes and dreams that were so strong and dedicated my life to working impossibly hard for something i do not want but have no choice in any more
anyone know what this is the other day i suddenly could not speak some mental thing not a stroke i could not form words
i do not really see much reason to continue past caring for my puppy she will be 3 in 2 months after my dog dies i will more than likely kill myself with a 12ga to the face
this might sound silly but she was like a mother to me and it really hurt me that she did not love me enough to not leave me that day
other people are not the problem it is your hatred and cynicism that drives others away from you you have to change that first
i think it could be sustained by a user base because lonely people might find it actually helps them when they are in a bad situation and i think there might be compassionate sympathetic nonlonely people who find it worth using just to help people who need and are perfectly capable of being helped
2 how have the feelings been showing up for you physically or mentally 3 what steps are you taking to cope with or to move through those feelings

past few months i have felt so rejected unloved trying to be cautious on what to do vs not felt like a burden to someone that i am in love with
i do not understand why she thinks only herself puts forth an effort between us i stayed up all night one night just to spend time with her
you will cross the line of being completely broken you will feel better one day and you will do better for yourself one day
ok so i was excited for university because literally everyone was like omg you will make so many lifelong friends it is not like highschool
i feel like i have not earned the right to pin the blame on most of the problems i have had in my life on my diagnosis a diagnosis i was just given not even two weeks ago
the experience was very foreign but welcoming i did not think i was going to remember as much as i did
i can not put another foot forward but at the same time i can also not do anything about my life
now i am worried if these convos are mild schizophrenia i do not know lately however it is been harder to not think about him it is been harder to resist texting him

i 21 m had a bad past with toxic friendships during my elementary and highschool years and i think its been affecting me even to this day during those years i was subjected to a lot of manipulation backstabbing gaslighting and other bad things
how i do not know what to do without him how i want to talk about our days like we used to
i noticed he followed a girl on instagram a week later he starts hanging out with her hanging out evolves into coming over to his brand new home bc he just moved out that evolves into staying the night a month after us breaking up might i add then one day shy of us being broken up for 2 months he makes it fb official that they are dating
she is in control she gave me food clothing and a house so i have to endure the verbal stuff for a while longer
i want to find another job but i am in a small college town and there are not any entrylevel jobs that interest me i am still here because i really want to save up some money but idk if it is even worth it anymore
for almost 6 months straight i had become addicted to porn because of the rape i gained weight felt horrible physically
if my mother would not be alive it would be much easier to end it all but i can not do it to her not after all the shit she is been through it would also break my wifes heart but she is young and i believe that she could get through it we were together just for a few years after all i know that is selfish but please let me finally be selfish just for this time
i feel like the more i try to find myself the more lost i become i truly feel like i am an unlovable person who will never have anyone to be happy with
snapchat i have to keep as i have groupchats for university group assignments but do not use it for anything else
i know it does not make sense but i had to do that and we are still kind of in the same clubs and stuff

i did hurt at first but in the end it made me stronger hardened me somewhat but i know deep down in my heart now that i do love myself
i want to talk to someone so bad but what would they help me with i still would have to own up to it myself
i knew i was lonely but at least she was there now it feels like she does not want to be anymore
do you think this is going to fit me for the next few months is it going to fit me for the next year is this thought going to fit you for the next three months do you want to wear that thought that the question you have to ask yourself
until i met my ex boyfriend in 2015 we moved in together pretty quick we had a great group of close friends
i would be lying if i said i did not want love a trusting loving kind yet passionate partner who supports me and let us me love him
i also at one point asked if we are ok and he said yes why would not we be i told him we do not feel the same anymore
on the 6th of december this year i was woken up early in the morning hearing glass shatter in my living room
because of his parents there are a lot of hard times for us but i always value what we have or what we will have but he told his friends when i am free from chains i will get a ps5 which broke my heart
after about 2 weeks of no contact he messaged asking if we could call he is still unsure of his feelings and said he would like to stay in contact when i questioned his intentions behind staying in contact he said he would like to see us start a relationship again soon after some time i want the same thing and i did not want to break up in the first place
so yea talk to me about some jazz man or some folk let us chatjason isbell excited for reunion to come out in a few months
i feel terribly terribly lonely dealing with this all by myself i think about how i quit smoking look very differently at life started working out
i am fucking alone and done with this shit i need an actual voice to talk to i do not want to continue living a life where i have no value to anyone where even my friends tell me to be better where i get the urge to burn myself every week
everything feels like a waste of time i feel sad all the time and i have had to hold back tears when the fam got together to watch recordings of our childhood at christmas i do not want to sleep but i am tired and can not fall asleep
realize that your life is limited ponder on death and what you will do before she gets to you any advicemy ex and i are coming up on 2 months no contact and things are getting really hard
she said that was dumb and she wanted a life with me midapril she said it was over and i needed to leave her alone
over the past 2 months i have just felt like i am progressively losing the ability to think and do things sorry if that does not make sense i do not know how to say it properly
i am really scared to talk about this stuff with my parents and friends because my parents do not think this stuff is that important and my friends have their own problems in their lives many of which are much bigger than mine
it is going to be anew yearnew me in 2021 and it is time to leave my past behind wish me luck everyone
i did not have any expectations but we kissed on the first and second date he is fun to hang out with he started acting weird after the 3rd date started replying less often started avoiding convos giving bland answers and generally being very rude i noticed he was losing interest he was basically playing the chasing game
doctors and psychologists i have seen do not really care to talk to me about bpd or autism since i am an adult male and those are apparently things they diagnose in women and children eyeroll plus it would not change anything anyway since i am already working on the assumption i have both
how about when they never asked you about your day or never actually cared to help you solve your problems what if all they wanted was kisses and cuddles rather than deep honest convos where you get to grow together and evolve together
i would like time to stop i just want to sit in this vacuum and not have to live with so much pain and unease
i left and tried to call an hour later but he blocked my number and then called 6 or 7 times at 3 am asking what happened because he did not remember
i saved stuff like my gmail and steam account but i lost my discord and reddit account i can not trust my friends anymore
hate myself more than ever atm hard to think that someone could care ab me deeply wish i could just fade into the void next time i went to bed
have you been struggling with feelings of loneliness as a result of covid19 off topic but i hope you all enjoy your christmas i just do not belong here
she did not explain further she said maybe i am a bit arrogant or something i realize she is nitpicking me and finding reasons to sabotage our relationship
and i felt how every day was just repeating the day before i also lost interest in school which i liked before
i have no motivation and i hate every day and i think it is about time to gowe had been dating for 15 years and i never had any doubts
i am aware that pushing your feelings away is not really the most healthy of things to do but i really just want these feelings to go away i do not know why seemingly normal human interactions unnerve me so deeply i hope it is not due to some lost childhood memory i do not remember much from my childhood
i do not hate women i do not blame women for my failings or life i think women are pretty awesome and can be good or bad people just like men
tldr broke up with a girl who i completely lost feelings for heard she was seeing someone else and now i feel like i have made a mistake and i am really struggling with it
another ask is to look through their text convo to see if he is telling the truth and that there is nothing more than just a drunk hookup to fully trust him again
september and october in an internship for university interesting but quite tough i am not wishing them bad things and i do not even really want to know how it is going to be between them
he still tries to talk to me in minute ways he replies to stories on instagram and asks me how i am doing and what is going on with me
i feel that numbness everyone talks about when you grieve except i have no issue feeling all the happy smiley stuff that happens now like joking around with a friend or watching a funny movie
i took her to homecoming my freshman year but she was not ready for a relationship in case you are dreaming about me i am too but i am doing ok
i want to your mother in the cunt you ing suck kill yourself fagsometimes i either feel too much or nothing at all
after that incident i started wearing headphones to school smoking a blunt at 820 in the school parking lot instead of 420 eyes low no talking to anyone
actually i feel like this is long overdue i do not think i was ever meant to make it this far anyway
he has never known how to be a father it is actually impressive and even less how to be a husband for my mom
until i get one i am just going to keep beating myself up and hating myself even more and i do not want to do that
i feel bad for including my husband in my complaint because he really is a kind hearted person but this is the situation i work full time as well and he has been brought up like most of the males have in our society here so all of the house chores are left to me like it literally does not cross his mind to do it
it is your deep personal relationships persona that i cannot understand or be with i think the time has come where i end it all
the holidays are coming up and i am getting pretty anxious i was wondering if anyone could offer some advice or support
technically my brain is still growing but society now considers me an adult and i no longer have the support i was afforded when i was younger and that i did not use because i felt like i needed to be independent
recently i have been on 2 dates with 2 separate people and they end up ghosting me i have no idea why i think it may be because i am not impressive enough i am 18f and have no idea what i am doing wrong but it just kind of hurts because i think it could go somewhere and it does not can i get some insight or advice
i feel terrible for being this person to them it is impossible to go back i can not handle it i turned 18 this year i got pregnant with my pedo stepdads kid
one way i have dealt with this in addition to reading and exercise and everything else has been to watch youtubes of people just being silly with each other for examle watching markiplier and ethan or jacksepticeye having fairly ordinary but deeply enthusiastic fun in their unum annus and other videos
i think it would be helpful if someone gave me an idea of how much people usually would eat per meal if it is not too much trouble
he tells me i can wait for him if i wish to but there is no telling if he will be back so he would advise me to move on
does he really just want to be alone because it is easier if he means that then i just feel so worried and sad for him
i feel like i need somebody to take care of me which i know is stupid but i do not know what to do about it
i need mental help and fast hopefully i get it one day i have be in a suicide watch list self harm a lot when i was 17 took anti depressant did not help
i am immensely lucky to have had that opportunity but what did it get me years with no job silence from recruiters broken promises and not even retail gives me a call back for an interview when they are urgently hiring
that we would learn to appreciate or at least respect our individual differences learn to live with each other get married have kids ect
when i was 18 i finally realized i could actually hurt myself and release some of the feelings behind the thoughts so i did and cut myself
if i had telepathy i think it would be awesome and i would not blame anybody for having even really weird thoughts
the only ones i have now that are remotely harmful even if it is not like 100 pills but maybe 40 or so are zopiclone 7
i am a genuine girl who does not just fuck around with anybody i want to be in a committed relationship but guys these days do not want that
i can not fucking comprehend what in the fucking fuck is fucking wrong with the pathetic piece of fucking worthless shit that is me that for so long can not fucking make friends can not find at least somewhat acceptable forms of loving relations have some cool social circle and life going on
so i told him that i would do it for him my 2020 started like shit and i have never felt lower in my life
i am nothing but filth i am worth nothing i wish i could just rest and go to sleep i am so tired i can never rest i do not know what i am anymore
i miss my mom so much i just want to hug her i do not know why i do this i hate myself so much
does he really want me or does he not want anyone else to have me i feel he is playing games with my mind and i am losing it
i do not feel i belong with people there is a connection missing a tiny something that makes every interaction feel just a little bit off
i have been taking some time to treat myself more since most of the guys who liked to flirt with me and all of my friends too never had still do not the guts to do it themselves
i do not really know how to begin to explain this but felt i could not go to bed without putting some kind of trigger warning into the world
how do i know which to trust i know that the diagnoses themselves should not matter that much but it is nice to have a name for all of my symptoms instead of explaining them one by one i would also like to be able to trust my psychiatriststherapists and what they have diagnosed me with
idk i always thought i was an intorvert but now i just kind of want to have something to do and people around
i could not find n anywhere even though we had stuck together like glue for the past four years and i had no idea what the fresh fuck was going on
a couple of questions and a general desire for advice do monkey branched relationshipsrelationships starting from cheating last imagine you unexpectedly get a 10000year raise
i have left religion which has removed a considerable amount of the guilt to stay i just feel like it is a matter of time before it happens
they say id rather feel pain than nothing but id rather feel nothing the pain also i do not want to sound too dramatic but you caught me writing this in un unhappy lonely moment
well my ex is my best friends fiances sister i was at his apartment tonight and noticed on the christmas tree were the ornaments i had given my ex
i will start preparing everything for after my death i know how i will end it i am making a list of things to do before i say goodbye and when i am done i will go
heads up i am on mobile so sorry for formatting and grammar i am still very upset over all of this i broke contact again and after 1 month he wanted to have contact again and this time forreal
actual friends do not make you feel worthless without themhello all i am wondering about some background of people here as far as reason origin of loneliness
he wants the ring back i am really scared for that moment that is when it will all set in for me that this is real
it was so hard because i have always eaten food orally before i was receiving food by the g tube
and you are okay started smoking went to weed and now to cigarettes work at a job that does not pay me enough
every year goes by and it just reminds me more and more that i am in the same damn spot i was in last year
they are usually short but sometimes they last for a few hours and are kind of more severewe had an amazing summer together we returned back home together and i asked you about us
they do not give a fuck nobody does i hate people who say that they have no friends and that nobody likes them but then go talk to their friends and go out with them if you are like that fuck you i hate you
i do not think family life really deserves all the hype i think a lot of social circles in life tend to be a complete waste of time
i am planning on finally ending it next week they claim they are too busy or just not in the mood i do not know what to do
this is bad is not it all of this one day before christmas i have never felt so alone and estranged from myself all of this just because i was exhausted and depressed all i can do now is learn from these mistakes take care of my body sleep drink water and then look a new job i am so disappointed that i let myself down like that btw i am 24
after all i quit in part to increase my life expectancy but i am so terribly lonely now and apparently am still going to die early
anyone else suffer from this and if you were able to overcome it what advice can you giveshe is now telling me that everyday she is in constant pain and that it gets worse and worse
i was able to text them back where i was and that i was hyperventilatinghaving a panic attackcryinghiding in the bathroom
1 month after he left me his father passed away i constantly feel like i have reached my limit god i am so exhausted
i just need a job for money and i will be free to get the things i need to die hopefully everything goes smoothly
i also noticed that when i have seen a long tv show i stucked with it because i would share my opinions with friends as i watched it
alsoi am addicted to porn there is more stuff but it is getting confusing and out of order so i am leaving it at this
how can i be the bad guy for not waiting for you to screw around and come back to me how can i be the bad guy for not putting up with how you wanted to treat me this is messing with my mind
i have thought about suicide for a long time possibly everyday i have good days and i have bad ones but each of them with the same thought
she could not go back home so she came to my apartment and we had sex twice one during the night and in the morning
we dated for less than a year and out of the blue they broke up with me citing that they just were not into the relationship anymore as much as they wanted to be and as perfect of a partner i was for them quite honestly their attachment style is fearful avoidant and i think they were simply triggered freaked out and deactivated themselves from the relationship all without communicating any sort of problem to me
if you are like me you do not want anyone to know so you hide it but a lot of the times it could build up so much you explode with tears it does not even matter where you are at i know because it happened to me in school a few times
when i 21f got with my now ex boyfriend 22m he asked me if i would had sex before i said yes and was absolutely truthful he said he would had sex before too a week later he told me he would lied and he was a virgin okay i thought he is insecure i have to be careful here
i am trying to make sense of all of this mess i need helphow can i start making progress or feeling better again when i am in this state
i just needed a place to type this i do not know what to do and i am scared everythings piling up i do not know if i even can do it
specially now that i came from a long term break up i can not help but to overthink that no one really cares about me even though i know i deserve love
everyone in my family goes there but i have not seen them in a while there is also a pack of ibuprofen in my room incase i want something extra
trying to make friends and failing it hurts it feels bad sometimes i cry all night because of what i go through
i wake up every day for the same shit to fucking get hit i want to diei can not do this anymore
and they all have reasons for declining they are not bad people or bad friendsit is just the way it is when you get older and everyone has other stuff going on good and bad
now i am just one person and i am one person among countless other organisms around the planet i am small but i am also big i have no meaning and yet i have so much i think that this is the same for you we are both here together you are not any less than i am i am not any less than you are
as the title says i go from being able to talk and laugh along with groups of people i am around to super quiet and unable to contribute to conversation
why i am wasting my time with such thoughts when i should be happy and i know it but it is getting extremely difficult because now i realized she has one on me
i do well for myself it is nice i make just shy of 7 figures i am in my mid 30s and it hurts the most knowing my parents think i am a failure at everything i do
she even digs into my mom for percieved slights that messed her up when she was a child no more chalking it up to chance i have tried
no matter if your relationship was toxic and dysfunctional or healthy it was still yours and therefore you still feel the disturbing and burning sensation of the split in your identity
i stood there with my mouth open and let her walk away unsure of what just happened he was so calm and determined to do it i just knew that he finally made up his mind
i am divorced twice and i have had a few failed relationships since i guess the issue with me is that i have had friends people i would talk or text with
and to be honest the only reason i have not is because of my friends please say whatever down below just trying to interact with likeminded people
it breaks my heart just thinking about taking some klonopin and pain pills and washing it down with rum tonight
i just gave up and told her that i did not want to put up with this anymore tried to word it as civil as possible but i was really pissed that she did not respect me enough to give me proper closure a week after we broke up i found out she hooked up with someone around the same time she started acting distant
i was so scared i did not know what was happening i had nothing to be so upset about after crying for a couple minutes i felt fine still shivering but no longer feeling that anxiousness
well dec 13th she brought everything back and dropped it off without ringing my doorthen summer followed what a relief everybody said not me tho but me too how lemme explain
then they talk about how their days are going and how they do all this cool shit while all i did that day was sit in my room with the lights off sad and pathetic as shit wishing that i would just get a message or someone to talk to
i am growing to hate my body more and more each day and its now to the point where i cry if i see myself in a mirror or a photo of how i used to lookeverything about me bothers me and yk i have tried all the challenging thoughts sort of thing but nothing works or feels right
i have got parents who are wellintended people and a very small friend circle whom i am still close with but my issue is romantic loneliness i grew up with two parents that did not love each other but would not separate growing up with no real rolemodels for how relationships should work i kind of felt like a fresh mold for whomever i happened to end up with first in regards to what was normal
just came back from work after two weeks leave from covid yesterday and today i started feeling really panicky and i do not know why
unfamiliar pain is we just broke up i am in new territory i am single again i do not know what is going on i do not know how they feel i do not know how i feel
for mei am sure there is nothing after deathi do not wish what i felt on anybodyi know lots of people have it worse and are still in the middle of not being able to decide if they can go on livingi do not want anybody to die because they are sad and destroyed by lifei hope you get through iti hope that everyone can find some peace in livinginstead of dying
my boyfriend and i were having petty arguments the month of october and i decided that maybe a small break from each other could help us to work on ourselves
i do not even know how to start this but recently i have been finding myself crying or feeling like crying over the smallest and dumbest things i am not or a used to be someone who cries easily like i would cry one or two times a year and during those few times i would cry it all out until i had no more tears left so that is why i am surprised of this problem now
i have also seen therapist and it did not help at all i met this person who had an anxiety disorder and we became close friends
i have been thinking today that is curious that the people who worry about me my boyfriend and a friend or two are the main reason why i am still here and they do not have idea about it
i have dealt with it for years it is cost me any chance i had at going to college my supporters at junior high did not know what to do with me
i always feel like i am doing things wrong even if it is something as simple as drinking water or clocking out for work
its looking like i am going to be one of them i have nothing to be proud of in these 25 years of life
i have never actually celebrated christmas and this year it is just another boring cloudy day except everyone else is happy and having fun
plea for help maybe i do not know what to feel i do not know what feelings to validate and what to say no this isint right
i am not going to stay alive just because people will be sad its selfish for people to force people to stay alive for that reason
i almost want to reach out to him and just ask if he really did not have time for me or just was not interested in me anymore but what good is that going to do i will shamefully admit that i kind of haunted his ig since we still follow each other and for sure know he is already talking to and pursuing other girls one of which he was dating before me
hanging was very uncomfortable i am too afraid of heights i always end up just giving myself more discomfort when i want a quick fix
his family his aunts and mom sent my family a huge box of chocolates at least 70 worth his aunt sent myself and my parents a christmas card his mom reached out to wish me a merry christmas and said that i will be missed this year and his sister texted me and wished me a merry christmas too
though i still have feelings for him he said he lost them but said after he still had some feelings for me but the breakup was the right choice i let go of him so i had no urge to text him
i lived my entire life isolated and lack of attentioni am afraid of keeping lonely the rest of my life without someone who can understand me
i can not get myself to go to bed at human times anymore i mean it is 223 as i am writing this sentence i can not get myself up my habits have gone to hell
and i was firmly of the belief that no matter how bad things got we would be together and work it out
a lot of people have gone through worse a lot of people have dealt with heartbreak before i am genuinely in love with her i suspect sometimes she is still down
there is a span of several hours i cannot remember and now my therapist and i believe i may have been roofied because although my gap consists with trauma response coping mechanisms there are other reasons that make us think i was roofied
i do not know what is so wrong with me i just want to know what it feels like to be loved and longed for
lately i have been just spewing tears for the smallest reasons and most of is just because i want someone to vibe with without feeling like burdensome or annoying or weird
male puberty already did what no surgery no hormone theraphy can revertdo i need to fucking chomp my limbs off to be short
today i told her i struggled with the lack of communication and overall neglect i said i needed us to talk a minimum of an hour a week
to call me boring in a place that is boring i do not think incompatibility can not be overcome her mother and dad are almost the same like we were
when in a day my mind says bed and xbox is only solution when in a bed at night my reality says what the fuck are you doing in your life
she said i was like a form of karma because she was the same way in past relationships closed off and insecure and now she knows what her exs felt like
not that it just stops but without him it will not get better the worlds so fucking self obsessed and they call it self love
the 2020 pandemic does not affect me that much i have not gotten the virus yet i still have my job although the company deducted our salary for a few months but i got back it again
he has ignored me sobbing knowing i was going into another room to cry because he was in the middle of something
it is that i still feel like a teenager in my head i am not grown up at all emotionallyhey this is my first post on here
but last one was 2 years with me and gone up when i strucked with narcoticsactually i do not be sad most of lat time with her
i want to finish things off but she does not get it in her view things will change and we can work on this but i know myself and once i loose interest then i loose interest i would like to stay on good terms as she is a genuinely nice person and i would like for her to be happy we have had this discussion before but it always ends up with us not breaking up
the only difference is that v gets those once per day but for me it is constant all the time 247 since last year at least i do not vomit blood
interactions with people scare me usually after talking to someone i end up crying because i feel like i fucked up
anyhow yesterday we had a particularly bad day where it was cold and we were backed up for a way in our online department outside work space
please breathe with me for a second or maybe a few minutes do this for as long as you would like because right now you are in control right now i am here for you and right now somebody cares about you
tldr my boyfriend is encouraging me to make a decision that will only benefit me and i am insecure that it will because harm to our relationship
i know this is not ok so why is it when i feel as if i am going to be swallowed up and reach out to the help offered i suddenly stop feeling anything or these feelings that seconds before seemed so vast and overwhelming suddenly become small and insignificant not worth the mention
i am now 21 from the outside i look happy and living quite nicely i stopped selling drugs started college consistent high marks from the outside i look like i achieved it all but deep inside i fucking want to rest my mind it just will not stop
it has nothing to do with what i went to college for which adds to my feelings of failure i have to live with family because i am not strong
the next couple of days i will start to feel a distinct type of pain like that of a drug withdrawal only here it is your touch your smell and the warmth i felt around you
those dark thoughts i have had them ever since i was 13 but they used to come and go then i will be in them for a few weeks
i wish i felt whole i wish i did not know as much as i did i am so tired of being alone
once it was officially said and done i truly did not want to date i took the time to work on myself my selfesteem prioritize school and make new friends
i want that you hear my side of the story so you can understand why i acted the way i did why i was hurt
tldr my gf broke up with me after having a miscarriage due to conflicting opinions about parenthood feeling like she lost her own identity and my dysfunctional family
i get that the way i became was incredibly unattractive to anyone in a similar situation but after all the fucking effort i put in when it was her turn to do the same it fell apart
i am so alone i am so tired of being alonepain is worse at night however pain can occur at any time and does endure a complete day
it is been just over 2 months since i broke up with him a lot happened since then and i know how upset he was though i initiated it this has been very hard on me and i just want to know that he is doing okay but i do not want to overstep any boundaries or give him the impression i am trying to get him back
he asked if i was dating again that made me cry i told him i tried but i just could not did not say more than that but i think he knew i meant i could not because those guys are not him i tried today too even got some matches and replies but honestly i just really do not care about them at all i am just not ready
so all my life maybe after the age of 12 i have been alone i still remember all the nights i cried as i still do
i tried accepting and moving on but i just can not i have this constant feeling of worthlessness that probably there was something wrong with me
i have been struggling with seasonal depression combined with isolation everyone i want to talk to are either too busy or just do not reply
i know i am unstable like rn i feel confident in what i want but any minute that could change for me like any second i could snap and do it i be very really k ow what is going to happen anymore and its terrifying how little control of my self i have i just do not know what i might do to myself ifk what do i do
now remember that person who broke your heart ofcyou loved them and gave them your all not because you wanted something back
hence why the name is this is reality plus chronic illness stuff means i can never truly get back to normal the same as others
do you have any advice i have so much school work to do and i can not even get myself to start doing them
the latest one happened a little more than couple of weeks back our meeting was an arranged one like in most indian traditions where we first met in 2019 we spent time together for a 23 days before i finally came back to my city and it was a no from her after a few days
all because of how bough groups choose or in the case of many virgins do not chooser how to live their privatelife
am i closer to getting on the path of solving it than i was before yes but i do not know how to fucking solve it
i sometimes slipped away waiting for your text telling me merry christmas but i knew that was not going to come and as the hours came cripping in the more i believed that our story has been closed
in this condition if he does not find true intimacy even if it is only with one single person he will suffer
this is literally the only place i could get help from but i do not know what to do at this point
now i am just bidding my time until my parents die so i can follow them them the fuck out unfortunately it will probably be a while
as stated above i broke up with my ex bf two years ago all of a sudden i miss him like crazy now i guess it is because my life is a bit lonelier now and its around christmas time which is our favorite time of the year we always travel at this time together to different places
it was something i knew i could stick with i had other cousins but my mother does not really gets along with some of her brothers
and she really accepted me for who i really was from the very beginning including my current probably worst version of myself
i want to open up and tell people how i feel but i am the type of person who believes that if you want to change it has to come from within
this man this person i used to love so much asked me why i am leaving him and i found myself not being able to answer it
i like to workout do boxing and cardio and i would rather save my energy for that lol so i started doing it too
i am currently stuck before lockdown i was taking steps to actually get the life i wanted but this whole year has put my plans on hold
but i lost my chance at getting a seat in any architecture college i also missed the competitive exam quota by a couple of marks
i can not have a normal conversation without it leading back to me remembering how much i fucking hate myself i do not think i have depression or any stress based on some random internet questioners
one time he exclaimed immediately after sex i just think it is so frustrating that it takes you so long to cum all the time and then continued to always defend his statement and added that he should have the right to say how he feels
the world is overpopulated as it is what is one less humantw suicidal ideation overdose intrusive thoughts negative thoughts death mention vomit mention
i still expect the loneliness to hit me hard some days i still love him so so much and miss him four years of love will not just go away like that without hurting
during the relationship i was depressed this came from a lack of purpose and meaning so i got used to dealing with things on my own even if i suck at it
together now and i am still alone with only faces on a computer screen plus chronic illness stuff means i can never truly get back to normal the same as others
otherwise we love each other deeply and truly currently we this mutual abuse has subsided but it would be naive to think it would not come back
why say you are open to receive pain if you yourself can not deal with the pain inside of you my 21m girlfriend 24f broke up with me over a month ago
it really hurt me that he acted so reserved and unemotional during the entire conversationanyone else going through this i feel i am losing my mind
after a year she gave me the idea to move to her parents place so we could start saving to buy a house
drowning in hopelessness each day until this life ends seems infinitely better than just ending it all at once this is a different kind of happiness
he was so dry and mean then he said he felt like no one cared about him and i told him i still loved him
the things i use to love are completely intertwined with memories of her and so i just sit in my room sad avoiding things that remind me
i am not over my ex and i am not planning on pursuing my crush per se if it does not happen i am fine but i am proud of myself because i can see this is possible i can get there i just have to keep going i can be alone have crushes fall in love not fall in love do whatever it is that i want and my ex does not have a say in it
it is really not as out of reach as it feelsi had a really fucked up childhood and an even crazier run in with drugsdepression and panic attacks
and then i slowly healed and i met j we had an instant connection and things felt so easy with her
anyway i am not writing this so you can stop me i will not even read the comments anyway i made up my mind i just wanted to let it all out to let strangers know about how i really feel inside it was liberating thank you reddit
he said that if i wanted to end things that all of my reasons were completely valid and he understood even if he has feelings for me
maybe it is selfish but i just wanted to be a priority for someone someone is best friend someone valued and remembered at least once in my life
we can not avoid each other and hearing about her plans makes me feel even worse because i know i am just killing daylight until i can go back to sleep
about a week ago we adopted another child zach and i fear for him because of how she is treated us but the reason i am writing my post is this
i just feel hopeless i will keep trying obviously but i feel ultimately like there is no point after all that i have just naturally missed out on by this point like really how do you fuck up making even just 1 friend through a life time of school joining groups of like minded people and initiating connection like at this point my life really probably is just some random stroke of bad luck
this is not a list of charities organisations or support groups i think it is relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them instead i wanted to list some of the resources i have used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene
it has nothing to do with me i have not seen him for 7 years and why do i all of a sudden care about what he has done
yeah i am delusional sometimes but she was the only think in this world i carried about and would do anything for i would do it all again and not change a single thing
what to doif you do not know what to dothe dickhead coworker said i would not hurt you i like you oh yeah sure fucking please
it really makes me feel self conscious because i do not resemble these celebrities in the slightest that went horribly wrong and here i am back at square one
this gradual change has made me call into question a lot about myself sometimes i question if i even know what love actually is or how it feels emotionsif that is what you would even call love are already difficult to explain but it feels like people just have some kind of natural understanding of itwhether that is due to some kind of biological factor or nurturing from a young agewhich would not make it natural but yaknow this is a rant okay i am not a doctor and it feels like i do not have that understanding
i did not have any longterm friends from moving around schools and again my family did not give me much support or love true support or love bc i was clothed and fed and pushed to do good but emotionally i was suffering
he had just taken half a bottle of pills and an entire bottle of vodka i asked why he did this and he said to kill himself
his cousins around his age call him out on it and think he needs to take more accountability when it comes to getting to places on time or keep his word
i can not be bothered to do anything anymore and i have just given up on trying everything bc whenever i get my hopes up about something it comes down even worse than before
in 2017 we decided i was independent enough to take care of myself so she left to work with my mums friend
she starts becoming more and more distant and talking less and less i am wondering if i did something wrong or if there was someone else sure enough i found out 4 days ago that she has already been seeing some other guys for a week now she seems much happier and talked as such to me when she finally told me this ruined any and all hope i had of fixing our relationship
sadly the day after we broke up she decided to take the opposite route i am not entirely sure the context of the situation but basically she is been hanging out with another girl i do not think she has feelings for her not 100 sure or if she does it is a rebound
so we are in uni and my ex had anxiety issues and whenever he was tensed about something an assignment or whatever it is he gets aggressive and you know could get a little verbally abusive
do not bottle that shit in while i tried to vocalize my anxiety he kept his in while he tried to fix mine
last night he was being a bit slow at talking just oneworded so i asked do you want to keep talking for the night
the next morning he told me that said he is sorry and asked for a hug i feel like i saw this coming but feeling blindsided at the same time i wanted to move out he said i do not have to do it now but i did anyway we never really said breaking up but i assumed he wanted that so i packed all my stuffs moved out and feeling very disoriented
he was always looking for job opportunities else where these opportunities were always much further away from the distance we already had between us
i know he will be back and i keep on reminding myself of that i also remind myself that he also needs to life his life and that a night or two apart will be guaranteed but it just hurts because it is not just loneliness it is also what i never had
sure we would go to a bar every now and then but i felt close to no one most of these people had their own friends their wives their best friends their own parties their own whole fucking life to them it was just extra oh a nice party here or there some gym together go drink some beers every now and then just some standard socializing
he said a lot of hurtful nasty things that day that i just keep replaying in my head i try to forget but i can not
as embarrassing as it is to say i just got out of a long distance relationship and this one has hurt more than anything in my life i really do not find anything fun anymore and i am now just a complete emotional mess she was the world to me and would do almost everything with me
yet i still want him back and would give anything to be with him again it sounds so silly even saying it but i had the feeling that we were meant to be
do you think there is a higher chance of reconciliation due to the dumper missing their family unity or their children
but i do not want to be like this anymore and i am not sure how to fix thisthat is right virtual unreal convo i know you do it
i am honestly starting to feel like i am going absolutely insane my mood changes so quickly i can not keep up there is literally nothing else i want to do more than to talk to him and get some answers
she ghosted me for another man married him and had his child i seriously saw a future with her you stop texting first and you realize how lonely you really are
madison and i tried to be friends after the whole ordeal i still loved her deep down but held it in and focused on just being her friend
then she started to pull back and cancel or delay out plans and did not want to play certain online game with me anymore
my leg the same i just do it it can take years and i do not want to feel this way for years
hi i am a senior in high school i am sick and tired of putting myself out there and getting rejected or put down
this is one of the biggest reasons i want to kill myself to be with him once again to play just one more round of csgo to be on one more discord call with him
she silently laid there on the bed while i did dishes i imagine this relationship and even the idea of a relationship is physically draining
side note trauma can because a frozen state in which it reduces emotions especially positive ones in the person hang in there is gets better
knowing she does not love me anymore hurts an feel like nothing i can do will change it i am sorry i know i sound annoying rn i am just
i am so glad to finally leave this hell hole i have nothing to stay here for so this is my final goodbye
even when i was in a fraternity i could not connect with any dude for a long time after you called the engagement off i isolated myself from family and my friend
we got a dog after year 2 which made me happier but he was always angry with the dog for just doing typical dog things barking using the bathroom in the house etc
one was named jealousy and another anger and i could only temper them out was when i had the honesty to admit i still loved her
thankfully my job applications before destroying my own computer were successful and i bought an adequate 14 inch laptop with a peculiar bronze colour it served me well for two years then i accidentally chipped the corner of the back of the screen i became obsessed with fixing it and spray painted the back of the laptop but also drenched the entire machine in spray paint and ruined it
i asked her why she does not like me anymore she said because she feels that she cannot return that kind of love and she wants that feeling of not being owned by anyone
being upset from being in pain and not yet diagnosed with whatever i may have is putting me at my wits end what can i do for this week that can help
i feel awful every day and i miss him every second i have friends that i talk to sometimes i try to not do that too much because i feel like a burden and i study so i am doing things for myself but he is always there he was my person my best friend my soulmate and now we do not even talk
i have tried literally dozens of therapists apparently i am quite picky a college student a hopeful medical student but that seems further away day by day
we both left to different states at the end of august and went our separate ways those two things combined have been a big burden on my mental health as well
i do not have very high selfesteem and never had all the bullying and people taking advantage of me throughout the course of my life has taken its toll
plus my mom had experienced her own share of issues so i felt like my own issues would become a burden
i think she is right i think back and i wanted out of that relationship so badly when it came down to it but why does it hurt so bad its all i can think about i find myself stalking her social media pages for an update and hoping that every whatsapp message i receive is from her i was not even sexually attracted to her in the end and yet this is how i feel now
recently i have been feeling extremely lonely to the point where it is affecting my depression i am desperate to engage with people
i have a strong intuition usually correct that i am on a good path and this will all one day be history
was also made aware that it is very obvious they are both using each other and i guess i am just wondering when this is going to be all over and they will get tired of each other and breakup bc it is killing me
it is also my birthday in 2 days and i do not know how i can distract myself and be happy any tips
she was so ingrained in who i am how am i supposed to just be a person after part of me was just ripped out
i do not eat properly anymore i either do not eat at all or i overeatand c doing this is not the answer hurting herself more is not going to fix everything
i need a break to unwind but i do not have that place i cannot just take a break from work slack at home and call it a vacation i need people in my life right now
but even if a breakup is awful it should not erase the good experiences the value of the time you spent with your ex do not you think and i think that deny your past with someone deduce that you were wrong somewhere
he would tell me how sorry he was but he had no energy to go anywhere to get up and get dressed he can not text but that i should call him he would pick up
he is my first relationship but i was not his and i just do not know how to cope with this i have been busying myself with school work and friends but at the end of the day
today while i was out i saw her once again out of total coincidence i then realised like usual i felt drained of energy
idk if people normally take their significant other go meet family like it is nothing special but see it otherwise i was a coward tho my selfdefense mechanism would not allow it
it is not like i do not have the support system because i do i just can not talk about it i just realized that i really need to stand my ground
it is hard when a relationship looks like this perfect thing almost like a facade to other people on the outside when in reality it is not at all like that on the inside it can send you into a downward spiral in your brain bc you are trying to force it to make it work but sometimes either the chemistry is not there or two people want completely different things
i was still stressed out though because she was going to try to prove that i was this kids dad and i could have been the timing was right and we had had a lot of unprotected sex i worried and lost sleep about this for 3 whole weeks
there is no proper rope at my house so i will need to head to the store and the worst part is i had to look up a video on tying a noose because i am just that dumb and even understanding that took me time
it started with a bad coughing fit which nearly made me throw up also started breathing heavily felt a little light headed and just felt very nervousanxious
we started hanging out again with her friends as i said they are also my friends now in the last two years sometimes i even hanged out much more than her with some of them and everything seemed back to normal
in chinese culture people value their first love and a lot of guys feel regret that they did not marry the girl they love the most which is their first love
your dream partner will come you can use this time to put yourself back together get comfortable with yourself and build your future you are still young and have so much ahead of you new friendships new jobs new knowledge and new happiness
i have been running this marathon every year since this years marathon i almost fucking won the race but i stumbled at the last second just to come in second this marathon my parents reminded me that i am still just a fucking loser just like i was the first time i ran this marathon
my current therapist is the only therapist i have seen more than twice in the past decade i have tried literally dozens of therapists
during that time i was terrified i cried i was shaking i could not sleep straight etc everytime i thought of that memory i get scared and could not think straight
hey guys i am going to start a youtube channel talking about mental health and i want to know what you guys think i should talk about for my first video
at the end she just blocked me and is ok because now i can rest from all this feeling but it hurts that she does not see my love more than someone who got mad because of her and will not give me a chance to get a good and close friendship in the future
and i did my best to become the stepdad for her beautiful little daughter 5f i grew up in a big family so i am naturally good with kids
be happy but lazy and probably not getting enough money to support myself because i do not have my parents to help me and i am too fucking sluggish to do anything
his parents and grandma not so much i was not sure how much this bothered him despite him telling me it was fine
later though i realized that what exited me was not having sex with them but just be with them more like be with someone having a good time in company
however at some point she says you did not change a bit and only went backwards and she is talking about an awful incident when i was being irrational by arguing with random people at a festival
i did not have the courage to leave you i loved you so much i was blinded but i was angry and sad
the one thing i am super proud of myself for is that i did not beg or cry and simply walked off with my head held high after thanking him for taking me out on my birthday i have not messaged him since and he has not messaged me either it would have been nice to at least get some type of apology or acknowledgement from him that our time together meant something
not sure if i just have anxiety and just being upset all the time or if i am depressed i am not happy most of the time and dread every waking day
those two things combined have been a big burden on my mental health as well i could but i do not want it
i came very close to killing myself this year said goodbye to people decided how when and where but when making a recap i realized that i improved as a person after so much trouble i had to face maybe if i keep improving if i keep facing hardships one day i will be good enough to receive the rewards
i am just so ugly that no one would ever want to approach me and this makes it so hard to make new friends
i just want to do it and get it over with i do not want to exist anymore and i do not want to wake up in the morning
after finally trying to move on from a very toxic and traumatic relationship for me i have found myself really struggling
what about when you bought them something that took you a lot to make and they preferred a materialistic thing rather than something made with pure love okay this one is a bit personal so pardon me
found out guess she was already fucking someone new within 3 weeks of the break up was talking shit about me and putting stuff on social media that was not cool
sure i spend way too much on gifts and now the things they say leave me again just thinking and thinking about death
when i was 16 i was bullied in high school i started cutting myself caught myself eating lunch in the washroom sometimes had this bully text me for months telling me i am worthless ugly and i did not deserve anything it gave me so much anxiety at school
edit i was trying to say that the people i see going about their day have probably been through worse or at the very least i have known people that have been through worse and can keep on keeping on
but now i have started to get the feeling that they enjoyed wayyy more than i did and this has started to poke me
it is not that this is the first time i ever felt like this but it never gets easier it always feels like this is going to be time that will last forever or that it will be a lot more serious
so i paid over 1000 but when i knew what have happened to her i was in pure shock and denial
he had called me twice like an hour and a half before we think he died and i did not pick up because i was watching a movie and that really tears at me n how i feel because there is always that thought of what ifwhat if i picked up what if i had done something what if
we have a written agreement and i believe my mum has her address so she is not really hiding anywhere i do not feel this at all i am still as in love with her as ever
but i have never like been to friends houses or really done sleep overs go out with friends or kissed my love
i impulsively text him every two days he has not blocked me in telegram but blocked me in whatsapp i cooked and bought cake but all he did was drink and play videogames we did not eat that night
again a miserable day will begin and end with the ever increasing pain just to repeat itself again and again i wish i die tonight it is so hard to live everyday like this nothings going to change ever i do not even feel human anymore i do not deserve this no one does
i have been ghosted by the woman i had a crush on we chatted a lot and had a wonderful date together
leaving suicide notes and not stopping them from being seen has been the worst mistake of my life so far because now i can not go back to them i am still alive and to me i am no better than people who emotionally blackmail others if only i did not burn down bridges i may have slowly gotten better
i was very quiet i do not remember myself having friends since kindergarten and even before that in the cendyand then it got worse as a teenager
bang my fucking skull into the wall so my face gets smalleri fucking hate myself for something i can not control and i have to live with it everyday
i was actually so excited because we had dinner with his family and i was bonding really well with his brothers wife
the thing is that we got one child m5 and maybe another one coming because we tried for some month now with no protection
i just know we planned the wedding i bought the dress and the kids and ex told him if he got married he would lose them
i want to stop i want life to stop i want to finally do something for myself i want to give up
all my life i have had suicidal thoughts and depression but i have never acted on them i think about it almost every day but do not have the balls to do it because i am too scared
at home i also get ignored a lot and i get the blame for everything i am not really close to any of my family as they hardly know who i actually am
after i moved back home i tried dating other people for about 2 weeks but it was not the same after that i still tried to be with him but he was not interested when he finally said okay let us try again i went up there and there was clear evidence of other women being there which broke my heart because i was only gone about 2 weeks
i think about how i quit smoking look very differently at life started working outi am about to go home and go to sleep
but going deeper into his phone i saw texts that he never talked about from years before he was admitted and our family had the intervention
my self esteem is completely shattered due to that and losing my job due to the pandemic i just want to stay in bed and i have lost all my willpower to do anything i have no friends and i have never been so down in the dumps in my whole life and i do not know what to do to feel better guys
you have probably read that loneliness is as dangerous as smoking in terms of life expectancy my friend even thinks he might have white fanged me
the act of help can be anything ranging from giving alms to the poor or feeding the hungry or even giving food to stray animals
and as i do not talk too much it is hard to find a friend as i can not approach anyone directly and most people at least in my class prefer a talkative person as a friend
an unfixable problem does not mean that a good life will never be possible we do not have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better
it is not helping anybody so before anybody decides to upload a motivational video on here please remember you are not helping anybody
i think this is what made me like this since the trip he is started to ignore me again i am really depressed
the way he left me said everything about our love and relationship sometimes i feel like texting or calling him and asking why
i just want to escape this shitty reality that i am in i think i need help but i do not know what for
he got mad at me once because i burned some rice in his mothers pot and i freaked out and cleaned it before she saw
i do not want to be a bad person so i tried everything to fix it but spamming her is only digging a deeper hole
i know its not healthy but how serious is it half the time i am eating perfectly normally and again i am definitely not binging during the normal times
why was i cursed i do not know but i know i do not want to live like this anymore i am a monster and i need to rid this world of my filth
you told me that i needed to communicate better you told me that you loved me i can not tell if i am awake or actually asleep doing this but it is odd why
whatever will happen i will always have something special to fall back on myself and my independence and stability which i worked so hard for
i know its all for a reason but what in the actual fuck i want out but i feel guilty but i do not understand why
i know i made the right choice i know we are incompatible it is only been a month and it still hurts sometimes i am in less turmoil after ending it and that is how i know i did the right thing its more peaceful now that i just accepted the end and let myself mourn instead of trying to force it to be something it was not
i still am on medication and some days are better than others but for the most part i am doing a lot better
i tried to understand others to listen to their problems without judgement and to give advice when asked i have been told that i am a good listener and a good friend but when i need someone to talk to no one seems to understand sometimes i am ignored other times i am misinterpreted and even criticised the more i try the more i am misunderstood and the more i feel frustrated
i am in a whole new town all different people i am a whole new person honestly i do not recognize myself at all
my boyfriend now ex desperately wanted to leave the town he lived in he was always looking for job opportunities else where
would it be helpful to do that or harmful or i just should stay out of it i am 16 she is 17
telling her my weight went up from 55 to 75 instead of 52 to 70 that i did not talk to other girls for a year while it was more like 8 to 9 months
and i can not say no because the meltdowns are childlike in action literal screaming and crying about i do not consider their feelings
i could not get myself to end everything but i am so incredibly tired of living i am at a loss and i do not know what to do
around this point i was aware that this feeling in my head affected the way i played games as well as my speech but for some reason i never thought that the two were actually connected i just thought they were different problems
i do not know if i will use it but i have it now in case i ever need it part of me is saying to self harm for a release
i have posted in here before and wanted to share my journey with everyoneyou are going to be okay and you are better off than the person who hurt you
i was on the phone to the police awful communicator i should not have asked 999 to direct the call i should have known better i dropped everything to find her and cancelled the police to call an ambulance instead
the meds i am on make me functional i am not at my lowest but not better even in the good moments suicidal thoughts seem to call me back and remind me i will never be free it is a hold on me and maybe it will not be in the near future but one day i can say with confidence i will end my life and i think it will be sooner rather than later
i do not have anyone else and i feel more lonely than i ever have in years this is my last cry for someone my last time trying to ask others to be here because i have no one do not feel you have to i want genuine people not someone who feels forced though that is sweet that you might feel pity do not feel obligated to do anything
did i do the right thing i know our friendship will not be the same i just need somebody to tell me i did the right thing
i was obviously she willshocked by this declaration as i thought our relationship was steady and that our love for each other was never in question
apart from the pandemic and quarantine i think almost everyone this year has had some kind of black streak in their lives
i do not know why i have not met someone who i just completely get along with every friendship i have had has mostly faded and i am left with one but i hardly see that friend ever every romantic relationship ended poorly because that person did not suit me i do not know if i will ever find someone who seems like they would be great to me i do not even know how to meet people 19
i just know that one day i am most likely going to commit suicide i may not be planning anything now but i just know it is going to happen at some point
mindfulness meditation just did not seem like it was the answer but after everything else failed i gave it a shot and the first time i did it properly
she introduced me to her parents as her friend tho her older sister knows that we are official and was very supportive
they decided to tell my little sister about what i was doing and where i was headed in hindsight i am very grateful
reddit i have been using as a substitute to instagram and twitter facebook i check once a day for messages and posts in my groups
we have been through many conversations already about different issues in our relationship but then she tells me that she feels that were stuck and were not growing anymore i felt the same too
k you were outstanding for the majority of my life i have had these walls up walls that were reinforced every day with the pain and struggle i would push aside for a rainy day
i do not have any friends right now i have been doing all the things people tell you to do getting out there going to meetups and events and things like that but nothing has ever stuck i basically have no one
this whole situation started coming to ahead after i moved out because i started taking more drugs then and noticed that it does lead to me getting foggy and paranoid of things that do not make sense
as i held back tears i faked joy from the gifts i got as that is the reaction i am supposed to give
i really strongly believe that this girl is then person that i am meant to spend the rest of my life with and i am not someone to partake in wishful thinking that being said now is obviously not the time to be thinking about that and rn i am just trying to be supporting to her because she is struggling emotionally
i am getting to the point where it is making me feel suicidal but i would never do that during such a critical time because the emergency services have enough on their plate right now
you may say oh you are thinking irrationally its just your emotions you will be fine but i have a perfect card for it i always wanted to do this and i am 100 rational i am not having a panic attack or anything my mind is empty
they had no food to eat and fended for themselves while my parents worked and got all my food and clothes
i am failing in school i think i may have adhdadd i am not sure i need to see a doctor to be diagnosed properly i can not visit therapist or psychiatrist at the moment or any time soon however i am going to see one in 2 weeks i have 4 days until my semester ends so i need to study and pass all of exams assignments and tasks that were given
i am sick of the advice the encouragement the motivation when i absolutely have none of it seeing a close friend of mine and her bf be genuinely happy makes me want to do something not something happy but something nasty because i am starting to resent humanity and how little it cares for people like me
i met this amazing girl at band camp yes band camp we have been talking almost nonstop for 5 months and just recently exchanged christmas gifts and watched christmas lights
i avoid people for this reason they do not own mei am just working my job is the satisfaction of other people the service of other people
she suffered from bipolar disorder as well but that is besides the point she was talking negatively and making this whole situation about herself
as an introverted yet undiagnosed autistic and severely depressed weeb i did not make friends easily if at all does not give a flying fuck about the way i feel
the girl was what you could call a tiktok crush its not like she is a massive star on the app but it is still odd
i miss the cat i got him so much it hurts i sit around unable to feel anything christmas with my family yesterday sucked
the voices of the people that hurt me and the words that they said to me play like a broken record inside of my head every single day

i read and drunk and read and drunk and fell asleep until noise from other apartment woke me up after an hour

she said i will stop talking to you too i really just want to walk away from my house and disappear forever

very modern live music vibrant atmosphere kind of thing about as aesthetically progressive as a religion can be these days i suppose
after that she told me that she was not okay with what she saw that day on my facebook as well as my actions and she wanted to see change in me before she would consider seeing me again

we were together for just shy of seven months but we were deeply in love at one point and had our whole lives planned together
and i cannot help but feel sad for the life he livedstevea pseudonym was 58 yrs old and died of cancer
i do not think this will help me i have seen so many bad things happen to many people just because they were ugly or unattractive
despite the fact that i was lucky enough to have my small group of friends it is not enough outside of them and my immediate family i feel fucking worthless and unnoticed all the fucking time
she felt like there was not a middle way in our conflicting principles since the children did not make it she saw it as a sign that we were not meant to be
sometimes i feel full of life and love fulfilled yet never fully happy but pretty close what hobbies do i have other than drinking and dancing and smoking and eating
but then 3 months ago she reaches out to me and starts flirting with me i was hesitant at first because some girls can just be really friendly like that
this is going to be a long post but i need to get everything off my chest i 22f met my now ex 25m boyfriend online 7 years ago
really it is the end of the world because the husband or the greedy mooches at work need something and i can not say no because the meltdowns are childlike in action
looking back i realize the flaws were that we never got into arguments she never once brought up anything to me that bothered her and we had never had a heart to heart conversation ever i imagine maybe this caused her to bottle up whatever was bothering her and because resentment
i am turning 23 next year and i am a broke student who basically did not go out at all this year due to covid
a bit off relevance he is a libra my father is a libra and i cut my relationship with my father when i told him i was moving here w my ex

we me and my childhood friend have not been in contact i guess about for 4 years now and the last time she wrote me was when she was on some kind of drugs and asked me for help

does anyone have discord i need someone to talk to i am rly depressed so i drank a lot 2night and think i found the secrets of the universe
we had our struggles but i had no indication this was where we were it was absolutely the most cruel breakup i have ever experienced and then after i did some reaching out
i fed up on my birthday and i know i scared you i know this is a huge wall of text
i am not one to harm myself on purpose have never cut abused substances or even been drunk but i can see the appeal
my girlfriend and i had been dating for 10 months i have never loved anyone like this before did not even know i could love someone so much she was perfect
anyways i am heading off hopefully someone will offer some advice or insight by tomorrow that or the bot will be the only comment still nice to vent i guess
i am always in pain and feel sick i love him and want to help but sometimes is frustrating not to know how
i feel like he is the one for me all i have been able to think about is what if we do not get back together
maybe at first when this problem started negative thoughts may have been very easy to catch but nowadays it is just this constant automatic feeling that i get in my head that means i am going to mess this up whatever it is i am doing is not going to happen the way i want it to happen
i get very worried very often and i play out possible scenarios in my head and sometimes argue and get angry at the people in the scenario
she did not took her hands off until i stayed still also with everyone being cautioned against large gatherings in canada this year will be just my partner and i
i do not even know how i could go through the disappointment and pain of having to tell my parents about this shit again
knowing me they will probably leave one day toolife means nothing to me i am sorry i do not mean to be a bother
i cover pretty much every aspect of the after breakup phase it is a long read but i really think you will get something valuable from it
but i still keep getting these thoughts i am overwhelmed he did not want to talk with me he called me parasite for trying to talk with him
sometimes i can control it and other times it like takes over me i am really starting to hate myself for it
at first i thought who cares you know she can not always be with me but it still hurts that she would not even tell me that she going and i would wait for her where we usually would meet
furthermore it would provide a sheerly interesting infographic it would provide a tangible sense of the problem of loneliness in the world if it worked
life came to an end for me and i am going to leave on my 30th birthday which is in december i have some sort of a bucket list which i want to do as much as i can
i am a commuter so i am not really on campus that often and i just really feel left out today i went to one of their dorms but i felt so annoying knocking on her door
madison and i tried to be friends after the whole ordeal literally no further word i mailed her a birthday present that i had already gotten and that was that
i need my waifu my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blanc that is allmy mental health has been getting much worse
i keep thinking i do want to be friends with her because if she had treated me this way in a relationship then what is going to make her treat me any different in a friendship
i am not some machine built to take abuse and then be negatively judged because i could not get over it as fast as you wanted me to
last time it was this bad i looked at my watch and decided to go to bed then realized i felt funny
i have had therapy for a long time about it but the cycle has actually gotten much much worse i need help right now for anyone else who has checked themselves into a uk mental hospital will they be able to help me and what should i expect
i spent 2 days watching a friend who had suddenly started to see things and hear voices i grew up in a big family so i am naturally good with kids
even after our break started i stayed active in her life but always worried that once her mother moved on to another boyfriend at some point in her life that i would eventually be shoved out of the picture
i can not take it i can not i used to be outside so i did not have to take this but with covid i do not have anywhere to go i can not guys this might be my last day on earth
i am not sure what to do because after all he is my uncle and at some point or another i am going to have to cross paths with him but i just can not
and the medications god the medications i have tried so many nothing seems to work for me all manner of antidepressants the only thing that does work is xanax but my family tells me not to take them regularly because i will get addicted
meanwhile i have difficult life and what is on the top of it is being led on and thrown away like trash why me why can not you fucked up someone else why it has to be me you messed around with why it is me that you have to made think that i find someone i can finally share everything with
the past couple years have been horrible losing all my friends cutting family out my life due to toxicity and just so much hell i have got no one to talk to anymore and i am feeling at the end of my wits during the holidays
i made great friends in middle and high school then i went to college and i have been doing good too
i am looking for friends on here now because i am losing it this year i do not see my mum often because of her work
i could not keep a job because i call in too much from pain everyone tells me i just need to get over it and live with it
obviously i am not coming from a place of deep depression right now so please pardon my everyday tone i have dealt with depressive phases in my life and have been treated for both depression and social anxiety before
so many things i wish i could say to him so much pain i just want to know then in the middle of our conversation my dad yelled shut up from his room
this year was originally regardlessof covid going well until a few months ago i recently broke up with my boyfriend because i was struggling with mental health
because i am lonely and i am starting to focus on damn time for some reason if i had a girlfriend i would not think about time
pain is described as stabbing spasm and a pain that radiates across the back it may stab on the left it may stab on the right
i have given up my entire body and continue to do so to a man who does not love me anymore who maybe never did in the first place
is it possible to simply feel that on a fundamental level life serves no purpose and striving to give it meaning through the establishment of a successful career getting married having children etc is pointless and make the active choice to not participate in life
because it is a waste and will lead to nothing but regret and humiliation the constant waves of pain can not be ignored
could be events could be a moment an interaction could be the way they treated you3 what steps are you taking to cope with or to move through those feelings
my suicide was something i have been planning for a really long time and so much shit has got in the way
i got the hint she did not want to talk to me i thought maybe something happened to herfamily and she needed some space
i think i can safely say that i have a relationship with myself sometimes it is great but sometimes it really sucks
i have become so numb to her daily seizures because it is the normal for our family i am tired of the mix between of hopeful days and i do not even know what is coming days
all of my friends are really nice and amazing and i would not trade them for the world but some of my friends in my friend group have some other mental health problems and one of them ended up transferring out of the school because she could not deal with it anymore
i have survived the last few years by finding one thing to live for and really i have been doing it my whole life
either way they meant nothing but my ex stopped trusting me even less in the relationship when she found out i was in contact with other women
there will be more on this i will leave this as lesson one in the ways to work on our mental health together
he said that he felt this way because he creeped them out and he never wanted to be called a creep
i posted in legal about a questionable hospital discharge regarding medical vs mental illness and some asshole responded by saying based on your post history you do have mental illness so yeah sucks to have your shitty life
i find myself still thinking about him my ex not that i miss him or anything just like dam it is done
i am just sick of life i am bored of life it hates me and i hate it but i am not suicidal i just lack so many different things in life and i have certain qualities that i would do anything to get rid of i can not deal with it i can not come to terms with any of it
finding a soul mate turned out to be much more difficult than i imagined i often ran into not very good people who hurt me
its been a long while she started to not really put effort to our relationship its been 5 days since we agree to give each other a break time and i did not see any msg from her since then
these people i would consider as my friend but i guess they did not many of my friendships started with them being in my class
i grew up in a really strict religious place growing up i was sexualized from a young age and was told to cover up my parents divorced when i was a baby my dad kidnapped me for half a year and despite the law being against him would not take me back to mom but instead drove me around the country
please guide me if it is not this is mostly just venting because i do not even know what to do at this point
i go back to work in 4 hours and feel sick to my stomach and i feel like i have failed my bloodline i have not slept since i read that email at 4am how can i overcome this
i have tried contacting my friends but they have not replied in over a weekhow do people deal with this shit and how do they not let it negatively impact them
i have a lot of blood drawings coming up and each time i seriously consider suicide i hate it so much i have almost killed myself before and i have convinced myself of it this time
i know that if i could meet the right person i would get better i just need someone to take care of
this week has been absolutely terrible and to top it off my therapist being really sick with covid has left me without any therapy this week journaling helps but it only goes so far when every day has been a new shit show
i explained to him that i did not want to talk to him for awhile until i am better over all this and then we could go back to being friends like we were before we dated he agreed and thought it was a good idea but told me if i need anything to reach out to him
they took away my electronics car keys and unplugged the ethernet on my pc which is what i am most concerned about because i was thinking of streaming to at least have some money coming in
if the superego wants to get better and the id does too also the ego works out a plan to follow and the person gets better
zoloft unlike another drug lexapro i think was simply miraculous for me and within a week or two i was completely back to normal
am only good at existentialist poetry would prefer flesh people but i ended up searching rloneliness did not iapologies for my language this is not my mother tongue just want to vent out and scream
something causing pain in right side of head somewhere behind the ear check getting strong visual artifacts glitches in vision check visual snow
all i want to do is get away because i can not be myself he already said his goodbyes i felt helpless knowing i was too far to do anything to help
i am not blaming her because i allowed it to happen but i internalized this and began to resent her as a result
she lied about it when i asked her until i proved that their conversation did not make sense unless there was something else said that was no longer there and she finally admitted it
sorry for this rant i have been holding this in for a long time and just wanted to get it out there i do not actually plan on killing myself but she makes me want to fucking slit my wrists sometimes
it is tiresome just some food i sometimes do not even eat because i can not be bothered to put in the effort required
it would seem that i communicated with the majority for no more than a week but together with my sensitivity and amorousness all this hit me very hard
then my girlfriend left me yet again i was broken and alone till this day i do not know exactly why she did she never did care to explain despite me begging
i hate seeing myself sad it makes me feel like i am wasting my existence being sad and alone and that makes me feel sad
she wanted to try and meet the next friday to talk in person about everything but after a day of just constantly thinking about it
i just keep obsessing over it i am tired of seeking validation and the worst part is i know i am wrong but i can not control it
i finished all my school work and everything i do not have anything to do really but it is weird bc i feel like i have or really need something to stress about if that makes sense
i am so fucking empty and at this point nothing will change that besides temporary coping methodsif it helps i am definitely not 16 no way
i had an anxiety attack last week if was not fun at all and it took me a few days to feel okay again idk i feel like i am over reacting and being a massive wuss over it but at the end of the day i can not help what i feel
in university my father gave me a beautiful 12 inch laptop for my education one of the keys was sticking and i popped it loose but broke the clip
some friends passed away one of them bade goodbye just this week the realization that i am too far away from my parents and loved ones during this pandemic
like i do not understand why they feel the need to have to say anything about any of this it is all such miniscule stuff that does not relate to them at all it makes me so irritated and bothered i wish people could just worry about themselves it is makes me feel very watched constantly and like there is always somebody breathing down my neck
what are your thoughts on this have you ever been surrounded by friendsfamilycoupleclassmates and yet still feel lonelywe got in a huge fight and some bad words were exchanged
in the message i sent her i said i would not contact her for a while as i needed to process things in my head
i found some help by going to therapy and working out at 21 i found someone again who really does love me
while i will not be taking on this many at once again because it is a lot of work and is giving me excuses to avoid self care i can literally say they are saving my life
i just want to share my story and tell everyone who is struggling do not give up and here i am alone more than three hours away from my family bawling on the floor by myself
i can already guarantee people are going to overlook this post i fucking tried everything that the internetfriends have literally fucking told me to do
it feels almost unstable and i am beginning to lose my own grip hardly even knowing what is going on anymore i feel like my mind is degrading and i have lost capability to think correctly
i have never reached out for my mental health in extreme fears that i will get rejected by my family and friends my parents response to mental health issues posed by my own brother is already horrendous to begin with i get extreme anxiety when thinking about reaching out is there any way of reaching out without having to involve my parents in the process
i am still struggling with my own depression and anxiety along with intense work and family problems but here he is texting me how much he loves and misses me when i am not there yet
i do not want to be this way anymore i want to be happy and enjoy my life but i do not know how
i do not know if it was happiness or just normal life but i did not get even a single suicidal thought since yesterday
i went through five months of being unemployed despite having a fouryear degree so i am grateful to have a job at all
i am 100 aware when i make this false statements at the same time i hate it very very much but the demand to satisfy my bpdish problem is getting very devastating
rightfully so i called her up and asked her about why she decided to do that and told her that i hoped she was okay
i miss his laugh his humor our facetime calls and holding his hand hugging him playing with his hair skateboarding and hanging out with him
i will go on the day out by myself probably feel like shit i do not know what to tell my parents
tbh i have been a terrible kid when i was young spoileddisrespectful and all the things that are wrong i did those things
i have been feeling very depressed for almost my entire life i live in a third world country and my father is an abusive alcoholic
i am as of this moment feeling very down i am dragging rock bottom in a lot of ways i can not say i have much hope but i am still clinging a bit to these changes and that it might finally make a difference after so many years of suffering
now to be brutally honest i feel like she wanted to get back with me again just because she did not really have other guys around her to look at and had no guy worth thinking about againshe was missing besides me and now that she did had some new boys to look at at school she zapped me
she was only 23 the first time and only a few months out of a 3 year relationship the second time we dated it was only 6 months later and she was 24
i thought long before now i would have mustered up the courage to kill myself but i still have not i feel so guilty when people give me things and money because i do not plan on sticking around for long i just need to stop being a coward
i just could not take it do you think there is a chance that she will come back to me after some time
no matter how much i want a friend an acquaintance or even a fucking number neighbor of all things i can not stop pushing people away
i want to know which changes in lifestyle are statistically associated with a reduced risk of committing suicide or suicidal thoughts
i tried to forgive after a few days but i simply could not i hate that i am still holding onto it
had to do a dramatic title think maybe i will get some response maybe this time sorry about that guys but i am just so fucking tired of being alive and being alone and not cared about life is fucking meaningless i am not an edgy cunt i want to fucking die so bad kill me please
2 nobody would really miss me that much most people see me as an inconvenience and a piece of shit which is mostly my fault not theirs
i recently moved back from germany in august my confidence was shot before that as whilst there i was sacked by my boss for no reason and then a little business i would founded was forced to close due to the pandemic
ghosted me after he said we would still stay friends and keep in touch not sure really what to do since i always bail when i am actually about to attempt it
so after the break up i was hoping to be distracted by my daily activities i mentioned above but that did not happen so i used another lifehack i thought that i need a substitution i downloaded the badoo and tinder got a few matches there but when time would come to go out i would come to an understanding that i am not interested in those girls
everything is the same i wake up around 1 do nothing until dinner and then i go to bed it is been like this for months and as the months went on i felt more and more like nothing
i go into no contact pretty soon after she dumps me in hopes of forgetting her but it never works i only end up in no contact while thinking about her and checking up through social media
they just became facebook official found out from my friend who is still his friend on social media honestly i am not nearly as sad as i thought i would be
i have been trying for a long time even precovid but just can not find the right people or make meaningful connections with the the small amount of acquaintances i end up meeting it certainly does not help that my experiences with the local lgbt community was pretty awful and i ended up rejected
nothing has changed since then except i am back home in my home country during covid lockdown all my time has literally been spent on my laptop studying drawing or reading the only time i have left my house has been once a month to get my cats food
to put it simple before i was in the relationship i was empty and had trouble really feeling emotions i was empty and numb everyday and suicidal most of my life
little did i know these admissions were subtle attempts at trying to end our relationship as during this time she had figured out that she loved me but was not in love with me
this is long but i did not know how to explain without giving background my ex of two months and i broke up this past friday a day after he said he loves me and we talked about getting married kids moving etc i have struggled for years with trust issues surrounding cheating rape sexual assault being diagnosed with gad depression adhd and the feeling of never being good enough which also stems from having immigrant parents
i am just so scared right now and i do not know what feelings to pay attention to i do not know how i could ever untangle this incredible mental mess
i think i put the second issue down to stress we have just moved into a new place and i have had a few stresses about various things but i am doing my best to deal with that writing a list of everything that is stressing me working out what i can do something about and what i can not trying my best to let go of the things i can not do anything about and working out a plan to deal with or at least influence the things i can
have been battling the overwhelming sense of loneliness since awhile and i feel like i am at a breakeven point at the moment
i was busy with school often times too tired or too stressed to do anything they were trying all these sorts of activities through her school making less time for us
there is a constant low feeling throughout the year but it increases around this timeis there anyone else who feels the same way
when the going gets tough you need to offer your hand to people who need it the most if you talk cool if not that is just status quo
i started recognizing the patterns analyzing stuff that went wrong made some plans for the future which previously seemed way too bold as i was stuck in this comfort bubble life with her meant to me
i find sometimes when i go through the thoughts i decide it is not the time yet because i still have to try x or do whatever
this is the first year since i have deleted all my mainstream social media nobody remembered my birthday and i have nobody to spend it with what i hate about having a birthday so close to a holiday is that my roommates are not here with me they are with their family in result causing for me to be home alone with no one to talk to just need someone to talk to
am i okay in the head i just want to die or feel pain in general but then again i also have common sense and do not want to feel pain
i am tired of being so ashamed of my mental health and hiding it because i need help and i want it but getting it seems impossible
we chatted a bit but i was pretty busy at the time so she asked me for my ig wanted to keep them there and they agreed so they are probably staying there for some weeks
every single day is pointless i wake up go on youtube spend the entire day watching pointless videos then go back to sleep
i seem to piss everyone off or annoy them online and at work at least this way i will not be able to do that anymore
my bestfriend do not really have many friends tries to help but this year has been a lot harder and it just feels like nothing anyone says is going to make any difference
if you somehow get saved the consequences are horrible you can damage multiple parts of your brain making you restricted to doing certain tasks
she grew really attached to me she always had mood swings felt depressed sometimes then really happy then sad again etc
i have days where i am fine and ask myself if i really am fine and just faking it or if i just distracted myself for the whole day
maybe not even forever but i see how long it takes people to get over someone they loved with their everything
in the past i have been on the verge of suicide when i got problems with my favourite person but that was actually alright when they left because had i already processed the thing it is like my brain is always prepared
sadly i know deep in my heart that it is a just a hope nothing will come of it and that holding on is just making the hole in my chest deeper and colder
i seek more distractions through love unrequited or friendships so that i can never be alone with this horrible empty feeling
they are fighting it and have gone through a ton already and right now they are living their life it is not over though they still have it
edit the comments are making me feel like i need to add more context in all technical aspects i have my life together
i am aware that i limited my time with them to figure myself out but now i have an education a high paying job and stability
just wanted to let you know he officially moved on to a girl i was suspicious about right at the end of our relationship
my full time job is an officebased job but due to covid19 i have been working from home since march my part time job on the other hand is a retail job
you ever do that thing where someone blocks you and you go over and over in your mind over the last conversation you had to try and figure out what it was that you did wrong
i have zero selfconfidence and it affects my everyday life so much i can not stop questioning every little thing i do
my girlfriend on two and a half years just last week broke up with me because she wants to have the freedom of being able to do all the things she wants
i tried to start an investment group and it failed also i am letting down every one who actually believes in me
the 1 thing that kept me stable when i was were going through a breakup is the mindset of everything around me is shit right now but in the end i will survive
we had a good thanksgiving with his parents on friday we had a separate one with my dad every day is a fresh hell and every moment i teeter between breaking down and shutting down
i feel as people tend to age they developed multiple friend groups of different people but i do not know how to go about that
25yo who struggles so much socially and has nothing to say in conversation with people feels detached from society and disconnected from other humans
i am not alone but lonely i do not believe in love anymorei do not know what i am doing in this world i am barely existing can not call what i am doing living
she told me not to swear and that lead to a conversation about the linguistics of swearing but because she is such an immature bitch and incapable of disagreeing about anything without framing it as a dramatic argument and then losing her fucking mind it ended with her yelling that shit at me for like 15 minutes
you the true lover can not sleep like genuinely cannot sleep your eyes are blowing out for too much tears dropping inside your very broken heart no appetite you do not even feel hungry for days and i am not even exaggerating here you really spend days and days without eating or drinking and yet you feel absolutely full
and talk your heart out with those who will listen and support youwhether alive or not i am not sure yet but i fully intend to disappear soon
she advised to find comfort in family and friends i have talked to friends about it and they have told me it will be okay but it is not okay
and having them crumble to pieces and feeling heart broken because i really gave them so much hope so today i decided that i would sell the ring i
the most loving parents who are both my safe haven my absolute dream job that i know i work too hard for pretty sure i am burning out soon
i feel alot better after doing it i also do not stalk his likes and i have basically changed all my usernames and stuff on steamdiscord etc
she said that she was done waiting for me to be open about my emotions and that after 8 months i should be able to trust her and be as in love with her as she was with me
we got together at the start of 2020 and spent the whole year together making so many happy memories we both helped each other through some hard times we never argued we were completely compatible i have never connected with anyone like i have with her or seen anyone connect with anyone like we did
so please keep going turn off the lights if there are any and let yourself fall asleep tomorrow when you wake up there is a chance things will be different there are no guarantees but you are important and the chance of your realization of this fact is far too valuable to turn down
do not tell me to get help i already received so much help love and support i do not need them give them to someone else who deserves it i am so determined this time nothing can change my mind
so i go to college work in a novel write the script for a friends comic read a lot actually into tolstoi and i fill the gaps in between with small talk i live with my family still daily chores and exercise
three weeks ago i broke up with my ex i had been dating her for over a year and i had never met anyone i thought i would love more
we would meet as she walked her dogs around the farm and talk but i chickened out asking her out each time
have not had sex since april i just can not fuckinh do it i can not kill myself but i also can not go on
my initial reaction was to not pursue her but she begged me over and over to give her a chance and so i did
things are going hard i am struggling so much i have ran out of tearsi have major depressive disorder bipolar 2 ptsd anorexia purging subtype and schizoid personality disorder
it is christmas day and i am so extremely depressed i live alone with my cat i have a girlfriend a supportive but distant family a good job i am physically healthy but i am so god damn depressed right now
i do not believe in fairy tales anymore i do not believe the concept of marriage anymore nor do i believe that there is someone out there for everyone
recently i have been out of a job broke living with my sister and her husband and dealing with a relapse into alcohol abuse
i just wish someone wanted to hear me you chose all those girls over me and i was the one who had to accept that
i used to go to parties and go all the way drinking enjoying the fun maybe flirting with girls and just having a great time but now i feel like i am making a fool of myself
they are all my own authentic thoughts and not intrusive thoughts these thoughts are almost always negative thoughts i am extremely pessimistic
no one probably wants to hear someone is problem when they got their own problem to take care of but i am hoping that someone hears me
then i began to think back at everything i asked her if she had been having sex with her husband behind my back
i am a wreck now and have no idea if it ever gets better i prepared for the entrance exams of architecture alone and i was very confident that i would make it
i have a best friend but she lives across the globe so the only time i can talk to her is early morning and late night so it is super difficult to fit everything i want to say
but the last 6 years of my life i have spent trying to get sober and i am something aa12 step fellowships call a chronic relapser
for hours that i am fine feel like invalidates my depression then i would return to my cycle of doubt and sorrow
that stung a lot about the fact that he just did what a decent human would do just so he can move forward with his life
i always knew he was cool but within these past two months i have realized he is got super cool hobbies and is overall really nice
her sense of independence attracted me the most and its quite hard to find that especially in my closedknit community
i was started on a bipolar medication for bipolar 2 patients even though i have never exhibited any manic episodes in my life i have exhibited severe depression and racing irrational thought i have seen things at night like my deceased cat at one point and frankenstein when i was a little girl those are the only two times i have had psychotic episodes which i told my psychiatrist about
while i think she understood me so much i now think i did not understand her just as much i mean i did but a little less
so if you find that you are having a lot of thoughts while meditating and you have to bring your attention back to your breath often that does not mean that you are doing it wrong that is the practice over time training your awareness you tend to find the thoughts come less often they are less intense and they because less suffering you spend more time in the present moment and feel calmer and more relaxed
so i just do not want to do it anymore i do not actually want to lull myself but i am having a hard time seeing reasons to be happy that i am here
i am in the midst of healing and i trust the process that when this pain is over ill be a stronger woman
we were texting and calling everyday finally he brought up the idea of being in a relationship now i feel i will not find anyone i have no friends
its hard coming to terms that she is gone i do not want to believe it because i am so used to having her
i do not blame them i am such a horrible excuse of a person sorry mean waste of space it is a no win situation i do not want to be sad anymore
i have got very few friends and no family where i am and i probably can not go home for months because of covid
they are contacting me but its clear the friendship does not mean much to them and its more about not wanting me to end my life with the clear boundary that ill never see them again
now it is not so great anymore hopefully there will be a time when i look forward to it again instead of dread it
the pictures of my trial photo session are ready and there is a big chunk of them where i wear only a towel
i do not even need to be suicidal i just need to carry out justice i am sorry to everyone i hurt in the past due to my ignorant ways
i hate living alone with a disability and people where i am at are not open nor approachable to make friends so my message is simple
just because i had no one to really talk to i need to release them and free them from the suffering
but took civil in the same university as me because he could not get a seat we still talk he is stopped replying to me at this point it is pretty clear he is trying to move on from us
for instance in first year a math professor expected me to get top grades in major exam as i was doing extremely well in class but he did not recognize the emotional stress when he told the students i was going to get full marks
i was still shy in my college days the fear of being watched by everyone in the classroom while standing up and asking questions was always there
like other lonely souls i can only take myself away to these imaginary utopian worlds where i have everything i need
long story but things with him the kids and the ex wife just got worse i still do not know half of what went on or what the real issue was
i mostly stay home people just disappoint me as of late judgemental and hypocritical a lot of people like to gaslight these days or point the finger and call someone a narcissist i am starting to hate society again
another thing is food related which as somebody who is in ed recovery really bothers me when i am looking through the cabinets it is always making a grocery list figuring out what to eat
turned out i fell asleep that morning because i had been messing up the twenty alarms on my phone the previous days and i forgot to put them all back for the final morning
this song will play over the mental noise that seems to be created as we go throughout our days we will then actively play this song to quite down the noise quite the mind and lower the rise we get when our emotions are reaching a boiling point
my dad says that i need to get over this fear because my uncles never going to do anything and i know that but i just can not shake the feelings that resurface whenever i seehear his voice or anything from him
i was perscirbed painkillers for the pain and i can not get it to change or make anything different iam not happy unless i am with my family
to all those who are fighting right now just remember this is temporary you will get through this you will grow stronger
since i can remember i have always felt that i had no friends even when i was in my first years of school 59 years old i would come home and say i had no friends even tho i spent time with my class i felt like there was no friendship
but it is not nor will it ever be i am so out of touch with people until i question whether i am even human
i have taken psychedelics before and always had a decent experience but today i had nothing to do and said fuck it might as well trip took half a tab of acid and waited for the good vibes
the feelings are so strong that it makes me want to rip off my skin or wish that i was anything but a human woman or even kill myself
i start spiraling into a black hole when i am not with friends for a while i start getting worse and that aching loneliness gets even stronger than it is normally
but all those times i felt like my emotions were being toyed with i feel like she is just messing with me to get a reaction out of me
i was in denial about my condition for a long time and used to have ambitious dreamsi do not feel suicidal at the moment
i do not want to talk to anyone about this so i just posted it here i do not really know what i want to achieve by doing this
on top of that i was getting even more anxious about covid because of my exposure at work and he was coming to the slow and painful realization that he soon might not be able to continue to afford his apartment in the city
the funny part about breaking up is that everyone tells you oh in a few months you will be fine and in 4 month it will be a year since we have broken up and i still am so deeply in love with him
it is like i can not even escape it when i sleep i am afraid that i am going to be alone for the rest of my life
i already can see how that conversation will go me probably going off about how sad i am and you just continuing to be detached and fine
i have been struggling for months to keep going every day i get up and force myself to get dressed even though i am not going anywhere paint and draw even though no one will see it and work out even though my body will not be used to communicate with anyone i have gotten a therapist and meditate now as well i have also turned to online interactions but i is not the same
it was only a page long and much better written than this i got some of my close friends to read it and they kept telling me how good it was and how it was a letter written with a million pure hearts
if something happened and i do not know it can not hurt me right but if he was being honest and the conversation is just friendly then i feel like it will be so much easier to forgive him
coming from an eastern society which in many ways is very communal i was suddenly thrown into a world where i was on my own as a relatively extroverted individual who understands the importance of mental health i took the necessary steps i tried not to isolate myself alone at home i joined groups that shared my interests i put myself out there
i ruined my own sisters life because i just can not control myself sexually or emotionally my breath noticeably became faster i was scared i almost cried and i could not focus straight again
but if i do that then i am cheating and i know that is not ok i am feeling so very stuck and i do not know what to do
if she knows that i am in town but i am at the other parents house with friends or enjoying some alone time she nags me ceaselessly to drop everything and hang out with her and when i do not answer she nags my parents until they guilt me into pacifying her
i want to die so bad for no reason i am a coward who is afraid if pain and the aftermath reaction from my family
i have gotten sick of hearing people telling me how to change my life without even understanding my situation i feel guilt as if i am not supposed to feel this way
my ex made me so insecure and i lost 20 pounds after we broke upthis is about my ex i know there are always two sides of a story but here is mine
thank you for your advices this group already helped me a lot after 4 years of ups and downs i was able to control my urges
another thing i noticed was because of these things about him i felt extremely lonely with him when i never did in my other relationships
i have no friends was living for world of warcraft but this current expansion i can not even keep my characters alive
i have forgotten how it feels to be wanted or desired sometimes i feel like i have felt everything i have needed to feel when it comes to love
no one knows i am suicidal around me i have never told a soul it would break my parents hearts and they would blame themselves that is also why i did not end myself up until now but it is becoming harder and harder to wait i do not care if i am selfish anymore
things happen and then i am a different person like a switch and sometimes i argue with myself but honestly feel like i am two different consciousnesses
but can i i mean is it too mean i really want to say that and i really mean that but idk advice
i get up between 11 and 1 the rest of the time and its longer still before i can try to do something productive
i spiral in that cycle and i can not stop i used to laugh at suicide memes but now i can not anymore
but nothing not even the self harm makes me feel goodbut i really think i am going crazy fourth and this big by this point i honestly feel very heavy with it all
claimed to be under pressure and said he could not textcallmeet me too much because it stresses him out and he wants to focus on work
i tried watching streams but i can not connect with anyone and it is not like streamers are there to give me attention
should i get another dog or should i waitmy ocd is about making deals with gods or promises to gods as a way to fight ocd compulsions
aforementioned soulmate feels like home but we have some sexual jealousy stuff going on which makes things not so homey especially now that we are 2500 miles away
it is usually not just suicide though so i would say that i am probably not suicidal though i think about it a lot and do think of it as an escape option if i ever royally fuck up i would say i more have a death wish
i have completely self sabotaged my career because i am incapable of making my voice heard and more often than not success in work comes from the people you know and the connections you make
i was told to refer to it as singles awareness day but that makes it worse it all just built up and i broke i am broken
of all people why him idk i just want to go back to the time before it all happened i just want to stop existing i do not know how to fix this
i often wish i could be normal or at least not have to go to the hospital a lot this has been taking a toll on me mentally for a long time but with how 2020 turned out
in a card she wrote that she knows that is was a bad ending but she wanted to give me this gift because she still cares about me
i am unemployed i dropped out of high school due to countless amounts of trauma in my life people and several different mental disorders
and today is my birthday i can not imagine myself with anyone but him my mind keeps bouncing between that and the what ifs
and i do not mean medically go find someone a friend family member or even a stranger can help you if your down
but i am just so profoundly empty with no answers as to why or how to help it i did not want to i had to
once things cooled off we told each other that we loved one another this was the begging for the end for us
i obviously understand that talking to people is a good way of being able to feel better but i have managed to keep it a secret from everyone this entire time even from my family i have had a split personality for a while now and despite the considerably big differences between my alters no one knows or has asked questions
so if it sounds remotely interesting check it out here and lmk your thoughts also i did not mean this to be some self promotion just trying to help me and others like us

i woke up devastatedi know its specific to a person but my accounting brain is looking for patterns and comfort from others
but in november it changed i started the month with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me through text that was the point where i started giving up fast forward a month i moved to a new neighborhood and got a new job so i slowly started believing that it is getting better but immediately after my mom and sister got covid so i had to quarantine
he basically clarified we were completely over and within a week has moved on to a 19 year old taking her everywhere i begged him to take me for a year dancing with her posting videos
hi so i do not really know how to start but my 28f boyfriend 28m broke up with me tonight we have only been together seven months but i thought he was the one

i went complete nc then but i have not been able to stop checking her social media even though she blocked me places and blocked her
at the end of the month my grandma from my fathers side died at 71 had to return home for the burial ceremony
so i did not eat food and drink except water for almost 2 months it was so hard because i have always eaten food orally before
basically i made a lot of mistakes but do these mistakes define me as unworthy incompetent or simply a bad person of course not
it is just this cycle of checking my phone eating falling asleep and then checking my phone again i have been doing this for months
but we are in the same classes and we had projects together and his anxiety shot up and he used to give me a lot of shit
my supporters at junior high did not know what to do with me i am on the autism spectrum i hate myself for it
hello so basically i am not sure if it is all due to me having pcos which makes my hormones wacky or just how i actually feel
along with that we dealt with family issues failing friendships a bout with bed bugs and slowly but surely dipping self esteem for both of us
believing in that a miracle might happen one day and my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blanc will become real and agree to be mine is the only thing that keeps me attached to this sorry bitchass excuse for a life this years new years eve the time when magic works and a miracle can happen is my last hope for it did not happen on christmas the miraculous time you say
but at the end of the day when ill be all in my room i feel so alone i do not feel like there is someone there that can see how much i just can not connect to people how its hard to enjoy simple things often times i just feel numb and empty
i emailed my prof just before thanksgiving he said i could make up the work but i never emailed him back and now i do not know what would happen if i emailed him since the semester is over
and the two realities are nothing alike the whole outfit and hair styles literally are opposites i feel like i need to choose a gender
i notice there is not much communal post and more of a means to vent so i propose there should be weekly or bi weekly posts where we can come together and talk about issues or ask questions regarding some difficult positions life seems to put us in
the borders have separated me from the only things i love and they show no signs of opening and they are destroying my relationship
problems came when i came home i analized all of her social media and found this guys profile both social and in the online game
i single handedly pushed away everyone i have ever had contact with and now i am left with very few i can count on one hand the amount of people in my support group but i can not count a single person who would be there for me any time i needed them
for 3 weeks before our break up we saw each other only once because of my health problems and i think she needed more support while i was not there which supposedly he provided to her
idk of this fits on this subreddit but i am just looking for a place to dump my thoughts and this is very big to me and i just want someone to say i am ok and not mad
my wife and is anxiety and depressions are at all time highs and we find ourselves to be fighting all the time

he has told me earlier in the week that he does not sleep with me because he views it as a next step and that hurt me so badly
we got into a fight and he told me if he is going to stress him out with it then i should leave
i am pretty alright with where my life is at right now the only thing that is keeping me down is the fact that i have pretty much no friends
let us discuss here i am sure that we can share some valuable advicei am going to start by saying that if we do not try we will never know
so while i was under the impression that i was just always tilted i began to search the web for potential solutions to this bad mindset that i had and eventually i came across a very interesting reddit post titled what is tilting a scientific analysis and explanation
i have been prescribed to take it from december 27th onwards and i am a bit hesitant due to the side effects next to this i also take pregabaline for severe neurological pain in my feet and quetiapine low dosage for sleep so i am a bit unsure how these go together
i really do not know how to explain this properly not sure how long it will take but i know i must keep trying
but she did not want me on the birth certificate so she could try getting assistance then when coming to name him he does not have my last name like we were planning just completely surprised me
and you were still here i wished i kissed you more hugged you more cherished you more before it was too late
people who sell or buy are seen with a stigma probably all over the world sex touches our feelings everyone in my class the fear they saw haunts me still except one girl
get over it whenever i make a mistake or fall short in something i have voices in my head tell me
bad memories block the memories that are good like i just can not get good memories because they keep coming back and show me how much of an idiot i am i truly do not know where life will bring me but i hope i will find happiness with someone or even find happiness with being able to make everyone around me happy
seeing the pictures of her beaten cut and scared humanized pornstars for me but here is where i started feeling like shit when i realized that i am such a scumbag that i needed to see a woman testify in court about her abusive relationship and seeing the pictures of her after her assault that that is what i needed in order for me to look at pornstars as human fucking beings
i have ocd and anxiety he never wanted to learn how to help me through the bad times that came from this he would not sit with me in the middle of the night and hold me just stop thinking about itare you kidding me
if you have the time it would mean a lot to me to share a piece of what you are all going through
this is kind of a toxic question but i do not have anyone to talk to i left my ex because he was unreliable at a crucial time and because he felt very trapped and overwhelmed by his life but did not do much about it unless it got critical hated job was depressed etc
i wish i could just have no contact with him but i hate the feeling that he does not care about me anymore or that he is not struggling
it is gotten to the point where i hear someone casually mention that they hung out with a coworker or a friend and i get so upset how is it so easy for other people in the moments where i do reach out i feel like i am trying too hard and the other person is just put off
i am not sure what the point of this post is i do not even want to hear anything positive i am just looking to speak to other emotional outcasts and maybe we can feel better through venting
as much as i love my father he is not much help and he thinks i just need to get over myself
my looks my personality what i did all of this disgust me i could do nice things but i can not bring myself i would not enjoy them anyway
i attempted suicide a couple years ago and again when i was 15 and he keeps on bringing it laughing at me and telling me i do not deserve to live he also makes fun of my weight or of the fact i was bullied in high school

when his housemate was there he got them out showed them to her asked me briefly whether i wanted to see them
despite bulimia i ate a christmas dinner and i proudly whispered to my best friend that i kept it down and i did
i have been on the receiving end of it in more ways and more times than i care to remember and i know i have contributed to it through my own thoughts and actions
i made the mistake of asking what the deal was with the yearly bear thing and i was mocked harshly for it
i hate typing but this did not stop me from texting her and making sure everything was right i guess you guys understand now what the situation is
i do have a right to be upset because he was my first real boyfriend but now looking at it and the issues that were at hand i am glad he is gone
he assured me over and over again i had nothing to worry about last christmas was really great our families loved each other very much everyone was thrilled
the only thing i feel bad about is that my coworkers will be the first to find my body i have gotten to the point where i have made peace with dying
all of the people i talk to say their ex came back to them after 3 months of being broken up
now i am angry and anxious i can not even focus on work this is such fucking bullshitso i know it might sound fake but stay with me here
i want him to keep living even though he is suffering because i will be sad when i remember him i realize how selfish i sound but it is true
if someone was to try to attempt suicide previously around half a year and then start feeling better about life but still have the thoughts and not completely happy should they still seek help can that intense feeling of wanting to end it all come back it it gone for good advice and thoughts would be appreciated
i told her that i do love her but the love i feel is that of trust and friendshipedit there is a typo in the title how sad

i did not get to see my mother on my birthday since my dad did not want to take me and i did not get to see her on christmas eve and i am not sure if i will get to see her on christmas day
the common practices contain so much vagueness generality and category shuffling you can go to a few respected psychologists and get opposite conclusions and sometimes the conclusions are very fierce obvious convictions which is justindescribably inadequate it is like a poor joke relative to meeting real competency requirements for ensuring safe accurate precise welltested and welladjusted wellcalibrated solution procedure
this guy is like my brother he is the only one that was still there after my abusive relationship 10 years ago besides my dad he is like the most important man in my life

on top of these issues many of us are succumbing to the depression and anxiety that so commonly cooccur with addictive disorders and we might find that our bad habits accelerate and gain strength as our mental health deteriorates why is this so what are the true neural underpinnings of these experiences divorced from any boughtandsold biases how can we use this knowledge to strengthen us
maybe i should not try anymore maybe i have done all i can maybe i am super unlikeable idk but i really need this right now
i feel like i am doing all of this too myself and that it is not really a real problem i would like to hear your opinion should i talk to someone about this i do not know i have a feeling everyone thinks this way but will not say
more exactly like it is the time for the prey to become the hunter that i should not feel love anymore and expose myself to being hurt again
i used to enjoy music playing the piano photography going hiking or trekking outdoors watching movies netflix youtube etc but these days i just can not find the motivation to do any of these
i continued coming up with these stupid solutions for years i became desperate because after each one failed not only did this feeling grow stronger it became harder to overcome no matter what i tried
so i feel the need to just constantly stress over the smallest things the satisfaction that i crave i will never get
but anxiety is anxiety and believe me i have dealt with it ocd panic disorder generalized anxiety but the energy highs are literally me feeling everything in the book

if it helps my medication 4mg risperidone 250mg venlafaxine i do not feel these are helping our live looks like life of 90 years old couple i am 35 and he is 43
i am only alive today because of the parents who hate me and wish i would die have fucked up my attempts so far
and if you are not the person then there must be someone else i just want to find this person again that makes me insane but also happy as never before
i ended things with my ex a few days ago recently i have been worrying about something so little but so big to me magic
i thought i could live my life distracting myself from my loneliness and just ignoring the feelings whenever they tugged at me but the lsd showed me i was wrong it showed me this in a brutal way it just presented the facts right in front of me the way they were no sugarcoating anything it was a very intense harsh and emotional experience will not be doing that again for a very long time
because the day you turned to me and asked me out i thought i was scum of the earth i thought i was a disgusting girl and nobody would ever want me
i did not flip out or anything but i never bothered trying to interact with her again bipolar people kills people that stuck with me for a long time
so i do not really know what to name this but any ways i told him he did and i did not understand why he thought i was unhappy
she was endlessly encouraging she was inspirational she was the yin to my yang she was a little secretive about some of her personal details but not overly so
surprisingly i felt somehow relieved i could finaly eat and sleep after that fight i contacted her the next day to apologise and saying that i had no right to get so angry she forgave me but insisted that she does not want anything to do with me because its not fair for me to suffer since i obviously can not control my feelings and she does not want the new guy to be jelous
i never knew i could be that happy until him i do not think i will ever be that happy again he was so special and there is nobody else like that
we meant at 18 and ended a week ago at 22 years of age we went to vegas 10 days ago to celebrate our 4 year anniversary
she has been respectful about not bringing up her dating life and what not but i know she is out having her fun
we have been through a lot together during covid she said she felt like quarantine brought us closer together than ever
she gave my a halfassed apology sorry i did not mean for it to happen like this but it did also happy new year in advance
i am never enough for him and to him i am less than a girl and not manly enough he is just fucking broken me and i am so tired
for him to not drink for almost a year makes me think he really was trying and that that is the real him under the substance
whenever i get faced with an uncomfortable childhood memory or recent memory i simply do anything to get my mind off that memory it usually comes in the source of some form of mindaltering substance a bad idea
i am wondering if i should call my doctor and go off the meds or if it is just the side effects and i am overthinking it
i can not fucking take it any more it never fucking stops and heroin is the only thing that helpsi keep repeating it to myself i am going to kill myself
she cried and yelled and ran away many times and the only thing i did was pursuing her to talk and calm down but she never did
my ex had broken up with me 6 months ago and it was a messy breakup to say the least leading to unfriending and a brief mutual blocking on social media
my parents are unhappy with me because i am still single i am their only child and they cannot brag about me to their friends because i am a loser
dating was miserable filled with poor excuses or ghosting although i tried my best to counter bothaugust was again wasted time
hi so to start i have very very bad derealization issues and depersonalization specifically to the point where i constantly see myself in third person and it feels impossible to live in the moment are there specifics for this at all or how to help and for a while i simply did not have dreams or remember them at least
since i am not really used to social interactions i do not really know what to talk about and i am afraid of being seen as boring
my ex bf recently reached out that he still loves me and would like to be friends because he is afraid of getting into relationship with me again he have therapist and psychiatrist honestly at first i thought it is extremely unfair because he told me to wait week month or year until he will be ready but for me it would basically be calming his needs while giving up on my moving on process
so basically last saturday he wrote to me first that he thought about stuff and he wants to get back together and he is sure that he was wrong to broke up with me
i have a full time job and it really knackers me so by the time i am home i just sit in bed and do nothing
i cried myself to sleep the first night then i slowly began to conceal my emotions i no longer cried as i could no longer release a single tear
mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people and we have enormous sympathy for themthe problem is that gradually everyone went home and only her friend and i remained
man i wish i appreciated being kid more i mean i have tests and a job to worry about now i am making a movie which is fun but still tiring and stressful i am still studying for my drivers license which is stressful as hell because i am terrified i will accidentally kill someone on the road and i am constantly thinking about how lonely i am and the possibility i will never find a girlfriend and be in a happy relationship i miss the days when i was 10 years old playing pirated video games my dad brought me
after i was blocked i sent him something on facebook about how he hurt me so badly and lied to me and how he broke my heart
my instincts are telling me to quit i am scared i will not do as well as i can on my course or worsestill fail
which was the same as the year before that and the prior years were exactly like that too same as my 18th birthday
since covid started there is twice to three times as many job applicants for each job and it is just ridiculous i can not compete with a masters degree or someone who has 12 years of experience already i just can not win i want to crawl away and never be seen again i want to disappear i just want to not exist anymore
so at what point does because and effect or the relevance of misdiagnosis gain credibility and those labels lift from an individuals shoulders to a cultural solution
i tried to explain to my therapist who i started seeing also half a yr ago that this is new and not who i remember being that it is probably not normal to lack emotions on a daily but she has not really been helpful in this respect i do not think i could explain well enough for her to get it
slowly this feeling that was much more subtle than usual got more and more intense like it always has and eventually took back control i remember that same night trying to go back to mindfulness meditation and it just did not work
lotr and videogames mostly card games6 months down the line i discovered that he was still communicating and still seeing the other woman
this crushing weight in my stomaach will not go away if i had a gun next to me id definately pull the trigger
not being able to think it to feel is better than living with the thoughts i have for the last few months i have been imagining my suicide and battling against my urges
something that always helps me is recognizing that if i do 1 thing towards my goal passions crafts mental health then i am progressing and that is all that matters
such a stupid thing to even realize or think about but here i amno one is ever there for you when you really need it
my issue is that i just can not find it within me to seek help i no longer want to help myself
she broke up with me before our anniversary dec 22 i even made an anniversary gift the worst is that it is given me so much anxiety that i still over think every word he said
though they do not care for me i am the middle of three children on my mothers side the oldest on my fathers
do not have a job or education anymore i am feeling so alone i have gone weeks without uttering a single word to a living soul
for example me and a girl i have known but are only friends went on a trip she sees some cool guys and says daaaaamn if you were not now here
recently got out of a 4 year relationship less than 3 months ago and found out my ex has a new gftalking to someone new

maybe i was just doing something wrong maybe i was going about this all in the wrong wayhappiness is an inside job do not assign anyone else that much more power over your life
if i could go back and time and talk to myself for 1 minute i would say yes you are right it sucks but it will get better not all at once there is no magic cure for it you just have to let yourself feel the emotions that you do in the healthiest way possible
i hope you are happy i want desperately to say this to you but will not because it just would not matter
i want to be happy these past 2 weeks have been absolute chaos and i am trying so hard to be okay for everyone that needs me
i was baffled it took me 4 months to realize it was her revenge the whole month it hurt he said the thing i was most worried about that it is barely been over a month

four days ago i broke up with boyfriend of 25 years drunkenly at 1am there had been some issues but nothing very serious i had a little crush on another guy and it messed with my mind i thought it was the right thing but man i can not imagine getting through this winter without him
although i did not have a single bit of clue as to what might have caused this it might trace back to a midterm exam that i had back in september it was not common place to have midterms in my school and i think the shock of having to continue the usual classes just made me unable to pick up the pace
my bedroom radio and car radio are both set to that channel and i never touch the dial i will take any and all jazz i can get
i have severe social anxiety and i guess anxiety in generally lately although i am taking the initiative to change my situation i have not had any luck at all finding a job
he is begging me to speak to him because he needs to get things off his chest in order to make peace and move forward
i19f suspect he26m abuses me emotionally as i do him please tell then it can get better and that they have to get up and make it better because
i feel like she has complete control of the situation and it has left me on edge which makes me wonder if this is sustainable
it was my 26th birthday i was living with them and i had no one i went to watch the godzilla movie alone because non of my friends wanted to join me
i gave a lot but they ignore but loving is a twoway process and in the end the substitutes are not enough
but activism just does not work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population we used to allow it until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming and not without regret we made this rule
last night when it happened i immediately sat still and focused on breathing 10 slow deep breaths later and i managed to put on the office my goto distraction even fell asleep after
she said she wants to see me someday when we both moved on and we are okay again i want to tell you how sorry i am how much i love you and miss you
i have never replied to any of her messages and do not intend toi do not understand why is she messaging me still
but in a lot of posts it seems that it is the only way to move on anytime i choke myselfwith the shower hose it does not work either
i sent hateful angry texts to her i have never done that before its the first time i ever told someone that i loved that they were a cunt
recognise this and often people get confused how is that he or she is already in another relationship after one week or one month we have all heard that before where we find out from instagram we find out from a friend of a friend whose friend told us that that person was seen out on a date and you hear about it
i have a lot of skin picking issues for a while i bite my nails and the subsequent skin around the nail that i also tear at
we spent a good time and shared a great bond and made each other more strong and strongi have tried a few months ago i ended up taking around 14g of modified release paracetamol
i am home for christmas and i am feeling deeply depressed i want to die my life is so mundane and the only person who would care is my mother
wish me luck i just wanted to take this out of me right nowbut one day you come back home and find someone else enjoying what was once your future
i do not say i am a good guy i have some mistake i am not perfect but i work very hard to take care of her i am not a gamble cheater drunk acohol i am just smoking
i also deleted dating apps and do not plan on redownloading them just because i am lonely so we all sit under the christmas tree opening gifts and i am already done after 2 gifts
in october he left me one morning after an argument and would not respond to me other than i am not ignoring you and i see your messages but he is disappeared on me for 3 hours several times before
and it is not like i have been sulking and stuff i have been doing good things for me doing good in school about to graduate and brought my gpa up more than 050 points making new friends and reconnecting with old ones treating my body better and going to therapy to really focusing on my mental health
emotionally abandoned by relatives i feel so week i think i am going to drinkhi i am struggling quite a lot with mental health and it only seems to get worse
after a few months they opened themselves up and told me what they were doing reckless driving taking drugs illegal in this country alcohol and some of them even bought guns from dealers
i never had any loyalty concerns all feelings felt genuine it does not even matter in what capacity but i just need him in my life
at this point i do not know what the fuck to do it is another fucking lonely friday uninstalled tinder as well got a few matches but mostly no replies or small talk and that was it
the magic of the holidays is gone and honestly i am starting to realize it was not magical at all it just felt that way because i was numb to my feelings at all times
i send a big thank you to her friend and i get a long replyan hour later i get a text from my ex asking which of the treats tastes the best
it is not that i had not had opportunities i have it is just i always like to know the person well and actually like them to become intimate
for some reason loneliness stopped hurting me like it did before i feel really really calm and even blissful i guess
she left me because she had feelings for him even if she tried to give me another shother love just faded
i have been to therapy for my mental issues with no avail all the medical professionals tell me that i seem to know my internal struggles and articulate them quite well
i thought it was getting better but now it feels like just yesterday she broke me we shared a home and so many experiences but it is not that bad
this is the first day i can say i have accepted myself againits been a long journey but i am so excited to move forward with my life
i cared so much for him and loved him so much and in my opinion i believe i was a good girlfriend to him
the fact that i am seeing what i have been trying to build for 16 years right in front of me while i am getting my unhealthy coping mechanism
day one and its so hard i cry every second i have to myself how am i supposed to do this for many days to come i miss you so much i woke up hoping it was all a bad dream and i wish you were here next to me telling me it is everything is okay
i am also jealous that they just can share a photo together from time to time casuallyhello i was misdiagnosed about a year ago
what really makes me consider it is the fact that during the holidays when i have been home i realized how old my parents are getting it might be partly because it is winter my mom has winter depression but it brings up unwanted memories
but i am trying to remind myself that this is not permanent yes shit really sucks right now but things will eventually get better
it is going to be hell for the coming n years but after that there will be nothing an eternal anesthesiai have read through a lot of these posts and can relate to so many of them
i already have a child to someone who else who if i am completely honest i am also still struggling to get over and we have been split for 3 years this week
i am in such a bad place right now and my life is a train wrecki feel like i have so much to give but no one to
so i guess my question to you is i have everything to live for so why is it that i still want to die
one of the things that makes me feel the worst is how i usually no longer have interest in doing stuff that in other points of my life i have enjoyed such as playing videogames or watching tv shows
do not read on it is just a ramble in a bottle please take care of you like i never got to before
i wanted the hopeand if he does not have any then what is the point if he does not see the future he described to me anymore there is no point in holding on i do not regret the relationship at all i regret how it ended and i will be reminded about it for a while due to the pain in my chest so much for forever
long post warning along with mentions of attempts and self harm also english is my second languagei do not know what the fuck is wrong with me but i know something is
when i get beat i get silent and become a fucking wall i hate getting flashes of the day i came out and it fucks me up so much but i always feel like i moved on but it always comes back to me
i only wanted her to be upfront with me but she told me to forget about it and now i feel i just need to call her and let us set things straight maybe a reset
always suffers immensely with no mercy and no break until they move on even after moving on the scar would still be there just not hurtful as it was before
it hurts more than i can explain and i truly do not know what to do he has said that i am like family and that we will always be friends
ever in all likelihood i will never talk to her againevery christmas we give eachother gifts and i would drop them to her mothers on christmas day
as well they do not understand what is going on in my head just thinking depression is like hes sad and they are not concious bt the void i am living in
i guess what i am getting at is this i really feel i have done everything i could have to work on myself and get myself into a position where the root of the issues we had now have solutions but it feels so defeating to know that this person refuses to even entertain the thought of seeing that change
2 two 15 minute booster sessions to followup after your session how can i stop feeling like rubbish and hating life right now
i am 19 now and today i officially feel like i have tried everything she responded by blocking me entirely literally no further word
keep holding my head can not stand up tired to take a shower to calm down but kept falling and holding onto the ground keep need to hold onto somehing feel like somones behind me ready to hit m i can not stand it anymore
i made a mental list of all my bad habits and would hurt myself if i could not control my urges
i want to take the lessons i learned from our time together and give it another shot maybe when i was with her she was still too youngimmature not ready for a real relationship
i know that may not be the healthiest option but it is what seems to work for now the main things that are the hardest are eating and sleeping for me right now
i do not have the balls to ask for help outside of an anonymous subreddit and every doctor i talk to just throws medication at me
i really do need counselling do not i this really is kind of getting out of hand so i thought why not post it here in the meantime
during the relationship we had an amazing sex life i am very selfconscious and he is the only person i have ever felt comfortable being fully naked in front of
it was a long series of events that just gradually got worse and tore me apartas an elementary schooler i was angry and violent
it is a redirection to something that is even better you will know when your completely over them when you do not care about what they or their friends are doing
one of my friends facing some sort of difficulty with choosing the best memories in any category and holy fucking shit did i try my damnedest to change and fit in
34 year old and single and it is killing me inside what is the point in living when you have got nobody waiting for you at home i am ugly and old to have a girlfriend now and arranged marriage is something i do not believe in
when she told me that she needed to cover for a coworker who is family died and we would not be able to spend her day off together it was right after she was happily texting someone and hid her phone when i walked by
i ruin the day for my parents and then get really emotional about everything i just want to cry and hug my partner
i just did not feel it with the new guy and now i am starting to think i that the one person who could make me feel that way was him and i can not be with him
what kind of doctor should i see about this if i even have to see onei am really struggling at the moment
i have called the local mental health resources to ask for help finding a mental health specialist because it is getting worse latley
few days ago he apologised to me said that he will change he can not live without me and i am the best thing that happened and he is miserable without me i being the idiot sandwich i am accepted him back told him he has to do things my way till he can gain my trust
i miss the way you would talk to me about things how you made me feel when it was just you and me
i am currently trying not to relapse because i have been clean since october but it is going to be so fucking hard after today
when i first bought her that ring i worked a few months of double shifts making 9 an hour she did not
she told me absolutely no and i expressed staying friends with her and her now bfthis is my exs bf i am talking about in case of confusion and she is extremely willing and loving and supportive of my feelings
sometimes i want to commit suicide just so they understand how much pain i feel but then again they would probably use that to gain sympathy from others lord i just hate it here they also apparently can not afford to get me therapy yet my mother has had a hell of a lot of plastic surgery
i have tried telling her many times how i am being neglected and getting no time since she is too occupied by her studies but seems like she is giving me what she can and to be really honest it is as little time what we give our acquaintance
tucked away behind closed doors just praying wishing hoping i can be the next body to bury this world is cold
she was calling me for the last couple weeks in the middle of the nightbruh do not contact your ex if you are no contact
professional mental health support does not exist where i am for most people it exists on paper not in reality doctors are mostly incompetent so my physical health has not been addressed properly over the last year
he says it respectfully but it hurts to hear how certain he is about not every wanting to get back with me of how a relationship with me is just not something he sees he did truly love me before but he lost his love for me and that is why we are not together anymore
time does not heal i cannot spend another pandemic year with my own broken brain i have made a major decision this evening i have decided to go with prayopravesha
thank you to this reddit for being a support mechanism when i needed it i am leaving due to not relating to the posts here anymore and to officially enjoy my new chapter without the emotional baggage of the past i appreciate you i care for you all i pray that you will overcome this huge hurdle in life once again
the therapist appointment is still far away in the mid of january somebody knows something to just kill this damn lonliness c
it was easy to talk to people and to meet them i found my way into a group i do not really relate to them although i only had 3 days to know them
i am not trying to preach i know many of you have harder lives than i ever will and i will never know your pain i just wish that i could pull you close and hold you and tell you all the things that are impossible to say with words
just like nadine main character i seriously hung out with my teacher during lunch breaks i know right what a loser
5 it is not like i will contribute to society i will just be the average 95 loser joe i just can not explain why i was so oblivious to the world around me
i guess it is kind of my fault for not seeing the signs but to be fair it was one of my first relationships
this christmas all i wish for is my own death we almost died if not for an incredible coincidence we separated
mind you this entire time he has a gps tracker on her her phone tapped and has been rifling through her belongings and following her around daily and somehow my mother who does not know how to raise the volume on her phone without assistance is outsmarting him every time
not just because it hurts but i want to become normali am still in the same hole of sadness and anxiety but maybe this could help someone out there
covehttpsappsapplecomgbappcovemusicformentalhealthid1020256581 helps you express emotions through music it is like a music mood diary sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves still needs work but cool idea
until now i am not sure does it the reason or i am just a stupid personnot looking for a relationship right now as his exes really made sure of that
if i got sick and transferred it to them that would be it i know that if i tested my luck that is how the world would retaliate
i am unable to post any statuses or anything because of these thoughts i can not even talk or chat with people and they think i do not care about them
i have a hard time accepting it when we were once so close we were best friends lovers and really chemistry
and in april he wrote to me after several weeks of silence and decided that we were parting apart from the typical hypocritical phrases about how good and perfect i am there was nothing else
hi i know the title really hurts but things are kind of out of control in my life our relationship has been the most beautiful and i love her as a person and how she carries herself
but in moments of selfreflection like this i start to remember how much i wish it was not there i wish i felt whole
but i am just rotting around doing nothing i am so ashamed of myself i blame myself i worked nights and she complained about that even though i always did them
few days later we would hang out after work at night have laughs one day i said i am in love with you she was kind of surprised but i was serious next day she says the same thing we did not date officially because of her very strict parents but we considered as a couple other coworkers also do not know if we are dating
you are everything i have needed and i can not think about anything but you and the dog as i lay here on the couch because the bed is too painful to sleep in when your side is empty
it is hard for me to keep going for a long time but wish me luck once even giving me a concussion that had me sick for days
i work in digital media and had a few successful projects but as i have said before in the end everything shatters and shatters hard
when he brought up that he was not happy in the city it was hard for me to wrap my head around as he wanted to give it a shot to move home and did not really have a plan when he brought it up
where do i get the courage from where i feel like something is squeezing my chest where do i get the courage to kill myself from
because even though i could find a relationship it would not be with anyone decent and i do not believe in using people to fulfill my needs
but i hate it i enjoy talking to my friends about shared interests or what is going on or how we are feeling or whatever i enjoy doing stuff watching shows and playing video games and whatever else but i absolutely hate doing nothing together it does not spark joy as my friend put it
i have been suicidal for a long time and have been cutting since i was around 10 but i can not bare living in this house anymore
always being lonely might not always be the solution to the problem but i believe i have decided to do this instead of living a life of lies where all i do is for the nod my head and let others influence me
i have always been contemplating suicide for years due to extreme loneliness now it is just a matter of time it is been quite a long time but i still see him everywhere
i took 22 years of being lonely and turned it around within 2 months all with the context of living abroad
we were flirting there was chemistry but i botched it as well she did not choose me so yeah my lifes pretty much in the shitter and has been for the past year now
my birthday is in january by spring i was on my own and i moved away to the town my father lived
i have been thinking like this for the past four months i have been feeling depressed since november of last yeari open up about my suicidal thoughts and self harm to my friend too much
tired of the missed invites so i make the choice to shut everyone else out i know it will stop hurting one day but for right now i am in pain
i have 3 children and for the past few years my suicidal thoughts have disappeared finally but now they are back because
perhaps that is the question that i should have asked myself when the break happened instead of asking how to move on and how miserable i am and victimized well with all the bad things that happened to me against my well it is my addiction to her my brain chemicals that are not functioning well my cravings my memories
i can assure i have a good base of knowledge in these subjects but lagging behind in marks because i cheat less like people are copying others sheets word to word and the examiner who corrects the paper does not even notice
i just do not care about anything except my boyfriend and a few friends i have had diagnosed depression for years but this is different
i turned to a few classmates in hopes maybe they could help but they just turned it on themselves i ended up helping fix there problems
so i suffer from aphentasia what this means is that i can not visualise images in my headi even thought about an open relationship but it turns out it is no going to work for me
idk what to do i feel by myself no one responded to my last post about mental health that i am going through
and since i was able to fight my compulsion with the fear of the promisepunishmentcurse days later i may want to watch that movie like a normal person and not because my ocd is asking me to watch it
today will be the first christmas without her at all and i am really missing her right now after her death i was doing fine but during the holidays i really miss her especially now
god i am sorry this is the third time i write this post i do not speak really well english someone use me rejected me and he even make me to say i love you but later he keep liying and liying about everything now i think i discovered that he had another person on his life
had suicide ideation for the past 5 or 6 years maybe more the only thing that is kept me going is being in education i enjoy it and it gives me something to do i finish university next year and am expected to start my life but honestly do not see much and constantly think that is when i should try towell you know
you hear stories about people hanging out with friends and having parties and in high school2 two 15 minute booster sessions to followup after your session
can i not just take a magic pill that will transport me to a real heaven without leaving a gross body behind just transport me please this world is ruining me death is gross where do i sign up for transportation
anyways i wanted to get this off my chest because i do not have the balls to go to therapy i would appreciate any feedback on how others got through these sorts of speed bumps without other peoplehobbies so far working is all that keeps me going i can not let my mind wander to far if i am always keeping busy
i have never been suicidal but have faked the act and feigned desperation for attention and not even out of or by desperation
sometimes he will say awkward things around the dinner table and can not pick up any social cues but he never means any harm
we have created a wiki that covers these issues we hope this will be helpful to anyone who is wondering whether something is okay here and which responses to report
but my anger towards him also makes me kind of feel like he deserves it after all the shit he is put me through but at the same time you only turn 21 once
give yourself a break for just a day without feeling guilty of doing so this year you have been on your back from the first minute
your daily actions and mindset dictate how fast or slow it will take for you to move on and get your power back after your breakup
but it was too late2 people from reddit told me that i am depressed but honestly i still do not think it is true
i am dreaming of money stacking up and good times with real friends but the cops wake me up and reality fucks me again
it seems he is getting the amazing committed girlfriend i always thought she could be she seems absolutely wildly in love with him
for example i remember a time she told me i should never talk like i was not good enough for her
wait till you find out about the massive emotional walls and how i like driving people away to protect my fragile broken heart
my ex and i have been broken up for just about two weeks she said she needed time to focus on herself and cure her mild depression and organize her life
at some level i am fairly sure some of what keeps me going is self hatred and me continuing to live becomes penance a form of self harm
i am doing a bit of research into this and i thought this would be the best place to do it id like to spread awareness about the issue in an interactive way and i would like to gather some ideas right from the people who experience it and are affected by it the most
i was so used to spending it on her even on the day she left me the last thing i did was buy her what she wanted
huh it is the first time i am listing those situations like this and i really got to learn how to talk about that stuff
i just want to stop this pain i just want things to be okay again i just want it to be okay and it is not like i want to die but i just want to take a really long nap or just stop being human and be a statue or a flower or something else for once
i replied with well you just kissed me 3 days ago what is the huge deal and i heard angry footsteps go back up the stairs
the pain of being alone at 30 with nobody and nothing is something i just can not bear i do not have anything else really that i have not found or made through him
i just want to know where his head is that is it all that for nothing did you ever love me like you said you are such a fucking idiot
those around me that though they could help have all one by one been slowly going through the five stages of grief slowly realizing that i was right back then when i said just let me die
so over the years i have tended and invested into longterm friendships to the point where i have made memories heard problems given advice as well as provided a shoulder to cry on
i also live in a small crappy town where there is nothing to do except go shopping sit at some stupid hick bar be an addict go to jail or die
so i am not too informed about schizophrenia but is it healthy for someone to be with a schizophrenic and as we hang around the same friends is it healthy for the both of us to keep seeing each other at times like she is really normal all of the time but this scared me and now i feel like a piece of shit
i have been trying to cope and in an effort to help i have put some extra sheets underneath my covers on the opposite side of the bed to subconsciously make myself feel less alone
meanwhile my stepmom decided to go stay in the next town with my stepsister so i am no longer helping her and stuck with my own thoughts
i posted a goodbye note on my facebook in the middle of the nightmorning a time no one would be awake but someone happened to see it and alerted people in time to save me and now everyone thinks i was just looking for attention
if it helps i am definitely not 16 no way i hate myself i hate that i am not strong and intelligent like the others
i wish i could get a therapist but i do not have the means to get one so i do not know what to do in order to help myself
shelters are full dirty and sleep deprive everyone who can sleep soundly in a room full of strangers then rise at 5am and back out to the cold
i understand i really do and i want to get better and give him time to heal i have been doing this for years and i want to stop
meaning i will need a friend to tell it to which i am working on but for now i was wondering if there is a good way to distract myself
i am using a weird reddit account i hope that does not affect anything i try to be a positive force in my other account i do not want to hurt anyone if they found out i am struggling this badly
i also experienced death early since when i was 5 i had a little sister who died in 2 years then my grandfather died when i was 11 my aunt when i was 13 one of my grandmothers when i was 18 and another now i am 23
i do not want to be alone forever but i do not know what i am meant to do i think this seems like a good place to ask
both being off work in the summer took advantage of the nice weather and saw each other every day literally everyday on the rare occasion we did not we would talked texted all day and went on at least 4 week long road trips together just the two of us
i will maybe go and watch some tv or youtube videos and feeling just vanishes when i looked at him it seemed like he was the same person he was when he was 22
she is so happy and carefree in group texts i have no idea what the fk i have to do i am on the verge of relapse after nearly 3 years sober i do not know what to do
you can change them if you do not like them and it is so important to realise your thoughts are not you
if you have read this far i appreciate it i hope you have had a nice christmas and if you do not celebrate it i hope you had a lovely day regardless
it sucks because before i actually got around to making friends i was fine with being alone i never felt like i needed anyone and now it is the exact opposite
i did my mbo in 4 years and i had maybe 1 person with who i could talk to after he left we never had any contact anymore
i pushed everyone away because i do not want to feel any pain i did not want to have another part of me being taken away from me again
recently my wife of four years left me it was a very hard decision for her and even harder for me to accept
and when i tried to talk about my feelings again he avoided it and changed the subject many times at point he said i like to throw curve balls
this christmas it is just you and me here at home with an abundance of material things but most importantly joy a living example of possibilities
we both told each other we saw a marriage future together and discussed the possibility of staying together despite 3 more years of ld
i have been there i know it is hard and i do not want him to be alone the main reason i would use it was because of the groupchat i had with my old college friends
i grew up in a house with multiple siblings having autismi have other mental illnesses but is it possible that i could also have autism but i have not been tested
sorry for any mistakes or if it was kind of hard to readenglish is my second languagewhen i want romantic relationships i do not want platonic relationships
she is an amazing woman and i have always been completely obsessed with her from the very beginning she has taught me so much and has changed my life for the better
we had common friends so i do not really feel safe talking to any of them in fear that it might reach her
most of my peers have been on a lot of dates sometimes with more than one girl besides dating i am not very big into fashion
all this along with other problems in life broke me i was not sure if i would live to be of age
when something is broken we usually throw it away but they actually believe that when you put it together it becomes more beautiful
i feel like i am left with the short end of the stick i made him better but he made me worst
nobody cares about me fuck lifei suppose the only thing left is to finally kill myself before my parents start nagging about my future
funny thing is i am only a freshman in high school i need advice or just someone to talk to i am failing today school principle invited my parents to school
my t and i have talked about transference a little bit we have touched on my maternal ideations and how it is normal etc
it does not help that i think she is being really disrespectful to our relationship but my boyfriend just excuses it as tone deafness
you gave me so many memories when i least expected them to happen mistakei went over again and we ended up kissing
two months ago i was hospitalised because i went a bit far with being mentally ill it is been rocky since then but today despite bpd i managed to have an amazing day
and it makes me feel even more alone and what i need is not talking here it is this is what happens to me
we are sort of distant to make the things flow natural after a while and we are do not talking to each other
i do not know how to start i think i have chronic loneliness i can not say for sure because even though i have been seeing a psychiatrist for a year now she has not really gotten anywhere and i do not have a diagnosis or treatment yet but i of course just wandered around internet and diagnosed myself like usual
both of us dealt with loneliness and abuse by a parent i am autistic and deal with a bunch of mental health issues on top of always being rejected by women
his issues evolve a lot around questioning his value as a person and why anyone would want anything to do with him for that reason i kind of feel uncomfortable going completely silent on him
i am moving forward but that does not mean i am completely healed i still have mini anxiety attacks from little triggers that remind me of him
i talk to mom and dad maybe once every five or six weeks my sister i will talk to every week over text but over the phone
i sent her a message in august asking if she would be willing to get lunch and talk to which i got no response and i sent her a handwritten letter earlier in november trying to briefly talk about some of the really positive changes i have made as expected there was no response to that either
i been hospitalized 3 times i been thru countless therapy programs yet it never seems to get betteri amso tired i have my last will and testament i have my note
not that i miss him or anything just like dam it is donei am really depressed and i really want to speak to someone
my partner is away tonight and before i met him i did not think of the warmth i never had to me it just never existed but know i have felt the warmth that he gives me and the safety he makes me feel because of him i am getting the things i never had as a child but without him tonight i feel cold and scared i feel like a child again without their parent
6 girls think am too innocent used to be a nerd but i know i can not we are doing no contact and it is harder than i ever thought
it means that we let ourselves sense what we feel entirely instead of blocking those emotions in any way we should even disregard all thoughts that pop up due to our rapidly changing and shifting feelings
now i am scared i am scared of the world i am scared to feel love again it is just me myself and i everyone left after you i tried to talk with everyone but there is no one everyone left
i do not have an inner dialogue i also can not remember sounds smells or feelings blamed me for him missing summer and going places it is just a big mess
could i of done more i am torturing myself and ended up on antidepressants i can not sleep i am always anxious and having panic attacks
i am thinking of killing myself tonight there is no one reason why but yeah not sure what else to do the only reason i am posting about it on here is because i do not know who else to tell
and i like it until hes adjusted the lvl to player like me to helli am not sure what is wrong with me
in fact exactly two months ago i was almost killed by a drunk driver who was also making a lot of unwanted advances and honestly would have raped me if he had not crashed the car
so i have a good question i work in a large grocery chain in the us anyway i have been working there since the world imploded in march or so and more and more i am convinced it is a very toxic workplace environment where everyone has to yell at each other for the smallest of things and basically go around on the hunt for people and belittle them into submission for small things
i am tired of feeling like i am trapped in my own fucking head and i am so tired of feeling like my friends hate me and just god why could not it have fucking worked
i found it hard to relate to those complaining about it since i was enjoying it so much what friends the ones i share a few messages with every now and then some say family
for the majority of the past year i would say i have had a fairly acceptable reaction to pandemic protocols occasional frustration with a few tears she would here and there
i even picked out a tree in the back yard along with a cable to secure around my neck i do not plan to ever leave this world in such a way so nobody needs to panic
then she said something else about the 27th that i forgot but i pushed it again and then she did not want to talk about it
i was doing good today until i fucking checked her instagram and watched her story she was at the gym squatting and it just gave me so much fucking anxiety like i do not why i did it because it is not anything surprising that she is working out and it does not show anything about her new bf she has one but idk who it is
i asked her how she feels with her decision and why should i have to meet her in person during this time i thought she wants to get back and i was feeling happy she then dropped me another bomb
as you can see i started a couple of days ago and i am working on spreading the word and gather souls haha for this project i do not have any interest of winning money with this i just want to help an put something up for people so they can be more happy or at least relaxed
also refer to positive past experiences to try to get him out of it to activate positive feelings from the past
while i was not the one the initiate the breakup i now know how good it was that we are broken up
at the end i decided to make the exams already done validate in a shorter 3 years course with other additional ones and i graduated in a course i never even heard about or knew what it was before just to end the thing
i am a virgin still even though i am in my early twenties but no only that i have never ever had a girlfriend and i have never even kissed a girl
says girlfriends are like shoes you have to try them on no tears nothing seems completely fine she is amazing but i am really not she just does not see it
knowing always what to say and how to say it having the confidence to speak with anyone at any time without feeling the pressure or being nervous
i also really hate studying adult life having to work i just want to do my hobbies but i do not even have time for them anymore so what is the point
i moved to malta many months ago for an igaming company i thought it was an amazing opportunity international experience within the european union
i just needed somebody to know and possibly give me encouragement since the session is still days away i just want to be happy
this month is my birthday and i just broke up with my bf20 he said he want to preparing his future and want to be alone not loving anyone
expressing my opinions and not even realizing that i am offending peoplepissing them offgoing overboard with substances alcohol drugs at times causing public embarrassment to myself
we spoke for 5 months she told me all about her boyfriend how he a cop it is even affected me a lot lately i have been crying so much and i never cry
anyway that is why i am writing down this in here and showing my thoughts to you strangers to organize it and maybe interact with you will this work little bit hmm i think it helped
and throughout my life i have disappointed my parents so much that i can not tell them about this i just do not want to hurt them
i feel like dying to stop being so tired i feel like talking so i do not have to suffer the consequences of failing
not filled with all the experiences all the loves all the fun all the journeys all the parties all the adventures all the companionship all the sharing all the belonging all the relationships all the sense of community of belonging of having people who understand you who are on your wavelengths all the petty and nonpetty dramas and joys of all of it that virtually all my peers have filled them with to the brim or at least somewhat
anyway i have hope that has not wavered for a few days now i am so lucky to be surrounded by the people i am surrounded by
she had no idea why but she went back to college and three weeks later she came back and broke up with me
maybe i should only care about myself and not about the girl i have a crush on i need advice i have cerebral palsy i use a wheelchair
but i can see the appeal i will see suicide stories now and think yeah that is a valid choiceso what is the fucking pointi tried to get euthanasia thrice
3 start trying mindfulness meditation for the first time and it works for a couple of days until i get carried away doing all the things i usually can not do
oh crap more context my little sister was born when i was 8 and diagnosed with a very rare genetic condition
to be honest i do not know what i expect from sending this letter maybe it helps you to understand my point of view
and that is the other thing that bothers me about what i have read of everything i do not have another get up and go in me
i am not afraid of dying last time i hung myself it felt amazing but sadly the noose broke before i died
honestly this happens to me when i try dating and it does not work out i wonder how he already has a person and i am still having failed dates i know i should not compare myself to him but i can not help it
i will know that in seven dayslately this thought has been plaguing me and it is something i have been struggling with for quite some time
in my humble opinion a toxic person is someone who does any of the following cheats lies abusesemotionally or physically and betrays you
i have been in love before more than once and experienced every normal human emotion but ever since i took an ssri i am not lead by emotion it is so numbed that normal human needs are no longer applicable and it actually feels like something i have to work on like it is not there
i think my younger sister 14 might be depressed she is very often down and unmotivated has self esteem issues and will often sleepstay in bed until late in the afternoon
when i think about the type of person i am looking for i think about somebody that does not view sex as an integral part of a relationship rather just like an added bonus which is pretty much how i think about it
i am just so sad and i spent the whole day in bed and i have a week off from work that i needed because i was getting too overwhelmed but i am going to spend it in bed so that sucks too
i read the message this morning they made me sound like an annoying 8 year old they were asking my mum to explain things to me like why not to accidentally call a random singer
i did not tell anyone for 2 years and when i did they did not believe me i keep trying to be okay
they are here and you are talking to them blaming them softly because you love them so damn muchtelling them how much you miss them and also how much they crushed you destroyed you
breakups suck but i feel that learning from your mistakes and actions learning what you want and do not want in a relationship makes the breakup feel more meaningful
i am in no way trying to date again and i do not think i will for a very long time but am just curious of another persons process through this kind of event
he said we could be friends after two weeks or so if i would have one day he was finally done with me bothering him and blocked me on every single thing
she and my dad probably think that i am a drug addict i am really not i barely smoked during college but my home is in california so i can go buy it anytime now
also my friend pointed out that i should tell my therapist about everything with my mother does anyone have experience with telling a therapist your traumas and could tell me what they do then because i always talk about the things that are going on right now not the heavy stuff that happened a while ago and tears my soul apart every night 3
i guess i am writing this cuz i absolutely have no idea wtf to do next the only thing that comes to mind is taking rice pesticide pills
if there is any mention of my partners sexual past comments on attractiveness of someone they knew etc i was just a group of atoms on this earth for a second then gone for the next
journaling and talking to people have helped me through my breakup what also helped is that i have not texted him and muted his social media profile
i know we will never get back together because ultimately he broke it off with me like a coward and kept giving me hope that he will come back and seek me out when the times right but that is not true because i have also realized that he kept saying he would stay in touch and i deserve better
why are people aholes like not everyone obviously but what drives a person to be mean to hurt others to abuse to laugh at you bully you talk smack f you over or try any of the above to cheat lie steal treat you like dirt
not only did she tell me she misses me but also implied that she thinks i am funny now if you know me you will know that i have being funny as my life purpose
it is just a play where i can authentically be me without anyone knowing it takes me seconds and over time it does damage to ones psyche
acquaintance some from the previous work occasional beer every now and then but that is all in terms of any deeper connection close to nothing
i did the first 3 years on 5 total of law school more or less on pair but with constant depression and huge struggle still unable to socialize
this is my account for venting and whatnot and my main is very active i comment so much and every reply just feels good i feel wanted even if it is a reply being mean
but the person i was going strong with for a year has already moved onto someone else i thought it was totally out of her character to do something like this
the relationship was 15 years long and i slowly realized that she and i were different but did not want to accept it
if i am always sleeping i do not need to escape i am choosing christmas as a final fuck you yo my shitty family
what is uphttpsappsapplecomgbappwhat isupamentalhealthappid968251160 this is a good one stop shop if you are looking for something to give you immediate relief it certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information
i spent these past 5 months of my ever continuing hell plunged further into a hole i felt i just wanted to be at peace
we were together for a year and the relationship was really good and rarely had disagreements most bc i am too much i recently made a new friend
the bank cashier i see the lady every other month for a few minutes while i pay some bills two months ago in our chat i told her how i hate my job the other day when i got to the desk she greeted me warmly and asked how my sales job is doing really took me by surprise
the first 5 days i would be okay in one moment then in the other a wave of thoughts would flood my head and i would curl up in a fetus position and cry really ugly and loudly lol
those were the times of my life that really made me who i am today i am still trying to figure out who i am
i am feeling so destroyed i hate myself i just want a kind stranger to talk to i need to hear your voice please just talk to me while i cry tell me a story tell me about your day anything please i just can not lie here in silence alone anymore
i just wanted to ask if introversion prevents you from building a social circleand if so how do you deal with it
he was not necessarily a bad guy he never cheated on me or abused me he rarely ever yelled at me even when he was mad he is supported me throughout nursing school and my nursing career he helped me become more financially stable he even helped set up a college fund for my daughter
i am just seeing the days passing by waiting for my inevitable and hopefully soon death in 2 years since escaping a sexually abusive situation in my home i have dated 3 people
is it to avoid such dire pain to endure in life is it only to seek attention from other people
whenever i felt hurt inside i wanted to just hurt myself on the outside at 16 i started taking antidepressants and gradually my dosage went higher and higher
two days ago i was the most open and vulnerable i have ever been with some one but since i took so long to open up it does not even matter to her
so my question is how would you best handle this i do not want to break his heart but i know it is going to happen either way and he disserves to be with someone who truly would love and appreciate him
i am very interested in this but do not have the skills necessary to navigate the literature on my own and discern what sources are relevant and what are not to answer this question
why are they still reaching out especially all that is happened but i willingly lie to myself and try to hurt people i am actually envious of
was not looking for anything it just happened i was in a really rocky relationship at the time that was on the way down
i am afraid of keeping lonely the rest of my life without someone who can understand megod people surround me looks so stupid that makes me fe stupid and even more isolated
i do not know man there is just this void in me that is been there for a while and i just hate it
he is always been very emotionally verbally and mentally abusive often belittling and degrading me like i said i have never talked to a professional to be diagnosed with anything
i worked everyday at just improving and learning to trust people enough to let someone in again i met her and fell so hard
i always have to be right in an argument and i am too honest with my observations of what people around me do
we have virtually nothing in common and i have been thinking about if i should leave for the last couple of months
i can not freaking sleep because i feel awful i am scared when i go into work tomorrow i will get in trouble for going home
as that is it my girlfriends dead she was the light of my fucking life i thought she changed me but i am still the useless piece of shit i was when she idk took pity on me or whatever fucking hell i have been crying for hours and in thinking of just drinking myself to death
but i can not play now because of exams if i try to play my mind would just start screaming about how i am wasting time
i honestly doubt whether i even deserve to live i am a burden a degenerate worthy of nothing but scorn why am i alive i am just too scared to die too scared to justend
this is basically just a call for help i do not trust the suicide number i honestly more trust these guys here and how do i try to rationalize the fear if i do not do it
i am currently sitting at home doing my homework and free like me by marc e bassy came on in my playlist and it stopped me dead in my tracks
the thought of it was scary but not anymore not being able to think it to feel is better than living with the thoughts i have
before all of this i was already having a very difficult time but now the will to die has never been worse
for them and this is really important to think about for them was it just a physical connection for you it may have been a physical mental and emotional connection but for then was it just a physical connection for them was it just a mental connection
so if ever comes a time when you feel worthless and not cared for that is your mind playing tricks and games with you it is trying to turn you against everyone in your life it wants you to see them differently and feel anxious around them at times it works you feel as if everyone is talking behind your back making a mockery out of you and simply faking their personality when you are around
i find myself wanting to reach out to the person i called a best friend for 3 years and she is polite and responds but i know i look weak attempting to contact her so i avoid it alltogether
this is the third day since my bf has moved out form our place i was so worried about it before it happenned
in secondary school certain events ruined my selfesteem so badly that i no longer felt like anyone could understand how outcasted i felt
on the night of the 29th potentially close to midnight or early morning on the 30th i 21f plan to take an od of paracetamol
i just exist as this dead soul i feel like a young child i feel like an old woman who is lived out her full life already and is just waiting to fkn die i feel like nothing
not going to lie i am extremely lonely and i miss him like crazy i want to get back with him i do i think i am constantly hot and cold i am extremely easily overwhelmed by him reaching out so much because it makes me feel like there is this massive pressure to have an answer now
it feels horrible to realise that i have not been able to concretely do something to at least try to avoid it from happening due to distance
i do not know what is wrong with me i do not even know if i have mental issues or if it is just my uselessness translating itself into self hate i just
it is so tiring and depressing and i want to follow through on my plans i just hate myself for being so stupid during my teenage years
and get she wants to find happiness for herself she is currently is also moving to a new state soon to start a new job
all of these things never satisfy me or make me feel fulfilled can someone help me i constantly feel like i am in limbo
she said she did genuinely love me for a time but from the beginning she was already unsure if dating me was a good idea
it is hope that one day i could be happy that makes this harder maybe the only way is to lose all hope
i have not done anything today and it was christmas i just laid in bed and took extra sleeping pills so i can sleep the day away
i completely forgot to block him on messenger and he messaged me there apologising saying he had realised why he was wrong
i am so anxious that my progress will begin to unravel as i am placed in these circumstances as my boundaries are already being tested
centred a holes who only care about themselves but that is the way i feel i guess when i am always alone because even when i am walking in the street people cross the road when i am walking on the same side as them they go to the other side and i really need some help with this and i why i feel like this if anyone has an advice or tips it would be greatly appreciated thanks
so i have been quarrenting since the 7th of december so now 16 days my covid test just came back positive today as i have caught it off my family so i will be quarrenting for another week at least
half of me wishes i was still with my ex the other half is proud of myself for getting out of abusive relationship
i do not cover up my cuts around my roommates back in warmer months when i wore short sleeves i did not cover them up in public either i do not feel compelled to hide them maybe i do not care what other people think of it like a silent destigmatizing of mental health maybe it is also a silent cry for how bad i am feeling
i was sad for about a week and snapped out of it this person was shit and i am here crying for a man that does not care
i am some 50 disgusting gremlin with a long horse face crooked teeth an asymmetrical face not underweight have an ed and more
its not from covid i have been this way my whole life more then ever since i moved to la and got off drugs i am more lonely now then when i smoked crack i have no friends no family within 3000 miles i kno i am going to be alone forever but i guess being in quarantine is just really reassuring me of that i am a skinny dude and let us be honest women want to feel secure they are not feeling that way with me they can see that
i have been hella lonely even before this quarantine as a student it is been quite draining honestly but i want to find solutions for it not just for me but also others
my gut tells me that we did have a good thingthat he cared and he was genuine the entire time but my mind can not help but think that he lied to me or that he played me
so why can not i come back why can not we be together if we both want it so bad my whole life is tangled up with him
i think i have been corrupted by modern romance as i still hope and believe she still loves me and there is a chance for us tell me whatever you want even though i have good days i am still morose and depressed over her
he would call me perfect we spent so much time and we learned so much about each otherfast forward to 7th grade make friends have same 4 friends throughout high school really close
i hate being male i will never be satisfied with life i ruined my own sisters life because i just can not control myself sexually or emotionally
5 years since highschool but during last 2 years of the relationship everything was going downhill she repeatedly asked me to take relationship to next level but i was not ready
and she did not even reply i can not live without her it is my fault she left everyone would be better off if i was dead i hate myself
middleschool helped reduce the violence because of the new threat of real punishment for assault but it was never fully gone
does he even care he has not asked about me at allis it okay to want nc and demand that i stay blocked what should i do
there were some girls but i could not open up and make any connections trough all that time i was checking fourtheye
but in the meantime it just sucks and i think i need a few more days to just wallow in my self pity so thanks for hearing me out anyone who read this
the operator told me to calm down and think about my friend and i am i am just struggling too i would not have rang if i could get there straight away
my mom is an active alcoholic and we do not speak at all really and her side of the family are all the same
if you read through all this thank you and any advice is appreciated the reason i know i am a shitty boyfriend too is i do not know how to help
instead people are being told to get help and medication talking to therapists who do not understand which i would never go to
i am 21 years old and i feel absolutely lost about my life right now i thought i would be at my happiest at this point but my life is on a pretty steep decline
if i laid next to her in bed i was always met with a growl of why i was staring at her
i have not told anyone the whole story most my friends have only gotten snippets or just the basic gist would talking about it help
will i ever get a chance of having her back i have tried many of the things she recommends some have helped for a short amount of time
any question i asked while he was working he called naggingi do not think i have the capacity to exist in this world anymore
so it was never the easiest relationship but we always made it work after 2 years in my heart i knew she was the one i wanted to spend my life with
i hope some of you have more help than i have and you can push through thisthe contract for my job ends next month and i have not been able to find a new account be
many have said that they have been feeling quite lonely and have been going through lots of mental health issues but from my perspective i have been dealing with these things for at least 10 years and i know that it is not easy but i have this impulse tendency in a jokingly manner to say amateurs
i made this new account a couple weeks ago because my main accounts were hacked i saved stuff like my gmail and steam account but i lost my discord and reddit account
i helped her out when her head was stuck in the mother for a good 3 minutes when she did not come out the rest of the way
my mom died 4 years ago and so the holidays are always really hard on my two sisters and i my stepmom and my dad are getting divorced after 5 years and she has been staying with a friend for the past few days she was a manipulative bitch who cheated on my dad and hurt all of us emotionally i am glad she is gone but the break up is really rough on my dad
the one thing i have never had but have wanted for at least the last 56 years is someone special to me now i do not want kids the closest to kids of my own that i want is my dogs and my nephew who i babysat 3 days a week every week from the day his mom went back to work to when he was old enough to go to daycare
iv never gave it much thought but today i feel like ending it all ending the tormented thoughts the long tedious days free myself from all the pain i feel in my broken soul i hope the world is a better place without me but if i am honest i am pretty sure my insignificant life ending will not change a thing
it is so hard to see the small light at the end of the tunnel i do not want to keep burdening the people i love with how i am feeling whenever i am feeling low
things like having an iq of nearly 200 being fluent in 6 languages are all rather a downside than an upside for me i like all of it but it only increases my suffering it only makes my sorry bitchass excuse for a life even worse so imagine what it is like and i have to bullshit an entire subreddit including myself
i feel like the only reason i have not died yet is for my boyfriend and my family if i did not have them i would have slit my throat by now
we both realized it was not our time meant to be together and being in a long distance relationship was hard for the both of us during covid
i have a woodworking project i am trying to work on it should bring me joy but when i try to do anything it is like my whole body is resisting
he left we started dating long distance sometimes he would be horrible to me and remind me that actually he is my ex
it started with a concern that maybe i would taken the drug i am 99 sure i have not but paranoia has gotten me in a bind
then i met a guy let us call him tom in the end of course nothing came of it and our relationship only lasted a month
the boys are not the same anymore you know they do not hop on as much on playstation and talk about sex when i am just trying to find out why i feel the way i am
he told me he went to drink with a friend from work the night he did not come home and nothing ever happened with the female coworker he just thought i would be upset of him talking to another girl
life is a big pain you have to deal with and i can not imagine what will my life look like after 5yrs later
in all technical aspects i have my life together i am in a loving relationship rent a nice apartment and am studying a masters degree
aside from talking to colleagues when i need assistance during my weekday job i do not have proper conversations with them as i do with my colleagues in my weekend job
however my mind went into panic mode see that is what happens when you open up to people noone wants you because you are disgusting
the people i am close with at the moment are all going through their own problems and struggles quite a few are not coping and i feel like this is the worst time for me to reach out to anyone and tell them how depressed i am but at the same time i am just becoming more and more tired to the point where i am struggling to look after myself no motivation to eat unless i am with others not wanting to be around people
she never begs me for anything and right now she is begging me i just got drunk and had fun with friends i met one guy
my boyfriend of 2 years commited suicide 9 months ago i knew he struggled with depression for years but i honestly thought he was better we were in a long distance relationship because of my work and things seemed alright that is what hurt the most i thought everything was good does anyone have any advice my heart has been torn out since that day and on xmas it is hitting harder
no matter how hungry or thirsty or anything i could not find the energy to get myself up every step took effort every movement needed encouraging
maybe i am boring or may be i have different interests or what scares me that i may be a bad person that people do not like to be around
i would not normally post this but i am lost on how to help them so i would like some input from others who are more experienced with this stuff
i am not even sure if i want to kill myself because i have an easy way to do it forever but the only thing that stops me in the moment is literally fucking laziness all my energy and excitement for things i want to do is gone and i am not excited about suicide and i really want to but i do not have the energy to do it
and i also cry because i wish i could be a little kid again now i struggle with severe depression and anxiety and ocd body dysmorphia etc
he decided this and he says i am the blame for all this i did this to myself actually now that i think about it it is more of an itch
i wish i had a girlfriend wish i could send her cute loving texts she would respond equally little fights and making up taking on responsibilities togethereventually introducing her to my family and not forgetting physical intimacy not necessarily sex like hugging holding hands letting me rest my head in her arms lap and vice versa flirty messages raunchy sexting etc
i miss my dad everyday but i know he is proud of how we are trying our best and how much we love each other
secondly i opened up to my dad and he asked why i was spending so much time on social media my parents have restrictions and can see everything i do on my phone and i told him that after my ex i became extremely lonely and so i turned to reddit and such to talk to strangers you guys saved my life literally
i feel lame posting here but i have been depressed the past few days because i realized that even though my state is reopening after the pandemic not much will change for me
no matter how far along into a break up you are it always gets better the world seems like it is ending around you the grieving the crying the overthinking the coping mechanisms
i want him back and i feel like him saying i will talk to you next year is a way for him to keep that option open for himself too
just the thoight of going to one sends me into a panic i am working on social anxiety and other issies with my therapist
i still struggle with loneliness a lot but i manage i have also experienced almost having a flashback during the last half year
i was scared of everything and instead of walking me thru the fear they ignored it and let it manifest into panic disorder and agoraphobia
it is been four months and i still love you i fed up on my birthday and i know i scared you
just could use any advice anyone can offer after the break up it seemed things might have been able to work out between my ex and i
yeah i am a fucking attention who are and you can probably call me one rn too and what the fuck is the point of this post probably my retarded attention whoring ass looking for pity
i have still a microscopic amount of useless hope though the kind of that you always have right after a breakup if you are the victim but i am about to get rid of it soon
i have my moments anxiety and depression does not help i am so sorry i hate myself so much i hate myself so so much
then the day after i wake up having a hard time breathing and seeing my oxygen drop to 88 my dad seeing this decides to take me to the hospital and see what is going on
i never felt so good or so sure about anything in my life other than you and loving you and loving everything about you
woke up on the ground the sash i was using broke i beg and cry for help i have already got notes written for my parents friends and her
there are frustrated people eveeywhere maybe you could say that in a way everybody or at least almost everybody is frustrated and sufers a lot because of this i mean many mental problems related with self steem body image etc are most times obiously related with sex some people even kill themselves
but now i just feel like every day is a dull day i have also never felt a huge joy of happiness even on my birthdays
i am 19 and i am an undergraduate since i was 13 i have never ever felt motivated like i used to before
i love her and i would have given up all my current life just to eat a stupid christmas cake with her
my kids do not need this angry toxic person in their life my family does not deserve to be hurt by me anymore

tldr unable to function or take action to improve my life feeling like a child overwhelmed and scared cry all the time
we talked about how shitty you are about sex about life i never had sex with this guy i did not like him
it never ends up happening i am not entirely sure why i mean i know i am not the most approachable dude i know that much i am 65 300lbs sleeved shaved head i have been told i look scary but i am a funny dude i have got a million stories to tell a million jokes i love to laugh and bullshit about sports women ect
i have no female role models in my life even my mother tried to abort me when i was little but my dad took great care that it will not happen
do you guys think she just wanted to let me down easy she is never lied to me in the past and i do not think she would do it now but what do you guys think does it sound like she is trying to get my attention
so instead of trying to get your ex back work on changing and improving yourself but not for her for you
i hate that she forced me to accept that she never wants to talk again instead of just calling me and making peace
only to find my number was blocked which was fine but he did still have a key to my place so i messaged him via instagram and he lost his mind
idk how it happened but she asked me for a time off cuz we had this fight and i agreed but after a few week i find out she lose feelings for me and she falls in love w the other guy
i feel so low i can barely bring myself to go downstairs because it means making it up the stairs again
i feel like this day and age of instant gratification window shopping for dates based on the most superficial standards the necessity for sexual confidence much less experience and sex appeal before or at least as much as anything else
we got out in time although we were told later on that if we had stayed in the house for one more minute i would have probably not woken up
it is worse because i know that he is happy and has a bunch of friends in a country where the pandemic is no longer so serious
just recently she came back into my life and wanted to make amends and start over with me but she just ended up pulling the same old stuff as before and hurting me all over again
and i never eat infront of people because i am afraid they will judge my dietif you want to not have your day soured stop here stranger
it is funny because i feel more over taken by anger now than i do by the sheer weight of my depression
i do not really know that there is a point to this but typing it out allowed me to finally cry and i needed it i just want it all to stop or to rewire my brain or something instead of having to feel like this so much
this happened three times then he started to distance himself in the country i am currently in guys are enlisted into the military after they finish their education
i was incredibly awkward thought i did not even knew how to dress because all previous school years i used uniform but all my friends were very patient and openminded
we have been split since march and i still struggle every single day missing him he was not even the best for me i think it is just an issue with me being lonely how do i stop thinking about someone i love when i know they are not right for me should i start hoeing around focusing on myself the last few months has not worked and the lonely feeling is eating me alive
i think that is what this is i have been single and alone in that way my whole life i do not know anything else it is like being in a pitch black cave and you have a lit candle that you huddle up next to it is dim light struggling to keep the dark at bay i know that the dark is their i know i am inside it but i have my candle the problem is the candle is flickering and when it goes out i will be left in the dark with nothing but my self my feelings and my thoughts i know it is large painful but i will not know and can not know until the candle dies
i used to love sports now whenever i even think about getting off my bed i feel empty every single day is pointless
i do not want to be here anymore but i do not want to hurt my friends and family i am extremely fortunate to have a loving family and great friends but i still feel empty
now s has a son i have always put an importance on the relationship she had with her son above all else she had given up her son for adoption to his grandparents as the father was out of the picture and her being 17 when she had him could not handle the responsibility of a child
i feel a lot of pressure in every aspect of my life that being dead really seems like the best option i am sick of everything maybe it is time to finally get through with it
sometimes she would argue with me because she knows everything and i know nothing and a lot of times she reminded me of my mistakes and problems one of them was being kind to her and other times she would say things to her sister while on the phone with me like maybe we will be together in the future and i was super confused
there is some teleological aspect to our relationship that does not coincide with reality we just are not ever going to get married and have kids
this was very much in the beginning and i was like what and he continued yes i told her i met a girl on tinder and that she makes everything a million times better by just existing
i have proven myself i am a likable person yet i have no interest in having experiences with other people you might say its a drug problem
i love him so much but just did not feel it was going to work long term so i felt that i needed to break it off to save us from getting more hurt later
for years the only thing that is consistently brought me happiness is playing this twisted game with myself of how much can i ruin my life
after each time i see my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blanc this is what i call her but by god she deserves infinitely more than that not only in a dream i love her infinitely stronger than before that and suffer without her infinitely more
maybe even one last kiss idk i am mostly just venting here but also looking for some advice but i still have this emptiness inside me

i just had a prehire appointment today with another company whom did not ask for references however i am afraid i will not pass the background check should this incident show on my report or should the prospective employer call my previous employer ask for a performance review
i moved back in with my parents last may because i did not have good financial prospects at the time i still do not
well it worked are you happy now is this what you wanted you got your wish ok you fucking got what you wanted merry christmas
i am looking forward to the laughs we are going to share together the the memories we are going to make and the future
it is ironic because the first two weeks after i cried and then was fine but it is hit me again and i feel hopeless about my future prospects will i heal completely it was quite literally perfect when we were together irl and was unmatched by any other relationship the big issue was texting and fting it feels like my standards are high but i can not lower them
it was a very hard year for me just like anyone else but i kept strong and i did a lot
she decides to vent to ot guy about it on facebook when i get home i see this and call her up while she is out with them
i have violent mood swings that occur very often in a day could be each 6 hours or each 30 minutes maybe even every 2 days nothing triggers these mood swings though
it was a cop and i went over and she explained to me that he forced her to reply that to me and she figured i would understand as we talked it out
she sent me a message telling me she should not have done me like thathowever i am stranded in gig harbor washington with no money how can i get back what should i do
i feel like i am lacking sense of humor plus i usually stay at home rather than cultivate my relationships with my peers
did you think that was okay and that it was all that was needed to satisfy me if you are not going to continue talking to me why bother responding in the first place
i understand more why you broke up with me for the past 5 days i have run in my head over and over what i should have done differently
i tell them my problems and they are that is normal i have already looked into loa but i do not think this can work and it is really a scam
at age 17 i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and signs of paranoia and obsessive compulsive disorder had terrible mood swings so bad that i can be happy then planning my own death few mins lager i was taking medicine to survive everyday i am hunted by my past but all i did is drink medicines and fake a smile but yes up until now i still have my mood stabilizers with me
another terrible part about my life is that i have been accused of being a peophile twice if you accuse me of being one then our friendship is over and you are getting blocked immediately
and because of her final details of how they hooked up i now have mental images of how they hooked upsupposedly that i can not get out of my head
why did i deserve this life why do i deserve to be alone while everyone else is happy and in love
i am only 12 years old though i feel like i should not do it though because others have gone through much worse so i should not do it it is like everyone was right i really am weak
but over the past couple of years i felt like i had gained some confidence and grew out of my anxiety of talking to girls and then this one girl i casually talked to for a couple of months started to actually talk relationships and stuff and oh my did i fall so hard for her i feel so stupid
today i was desperately trying to find someone or something to give me just a fraction of hope found a website and was told to pay and i sort of cracked
peaceful the idea of being nothing and existing nowhere felt like such a relief and i was actually excited to go
i just wanted to tell everyone that despite the curve ball life throws at us we as individuals can help people even if it is just sharing common household knowledge even with all the bad things about reddit subreddit communities can indeed come together sharing information
like for some reason i do not want to be judged but hurting animals is a intrusive thought of mine but i have animals and i love them with all my heart and would never hurt them
i do not know if this is the place to post but i do not know where else to post i am sorry if my post does not make sense i am scared and worried and my brain is a mess
christi do not even know why i am typing all of this it is all pointless in the end i blocked his number again right after i sent it
my overthinking thoughts are becoming more rapid i am having mental breakdowns i love my boyfriend but i feel like such a failure
stop forcing your ex to give you answers on why things did not unravel as you wanted them to if you keep bugging them they will either lie to you ignore you or worst of all tell you the truth and that is a thought pill to stick up your ass
i can not cry either not for sadness at least i may do so when watching a show for example but i can not for things about me i can not get angry either last time i got angry was more than two years ago sure when it happens i make a mess but yeah really rare
i am not sure if it is the right subreddit where to publish it but here is my story i had a relationship for over a yearlong with a guy
i was called a histrionic by an armchair psychiatrist woman who did not know me over making a mistake of making a vent the only thing keeping me going is my family and my job i know there is something wrong with me as i have mental disorders or disabilities that make it harder for me to live as a human being but some people just like to judge me immediately
i was absolutely sure what she will say something like nothing special herei did not received answer in 1 amin and looked at her face
hello recently i have been overthinking one thing to the extent that my left part of the brain squeezing and hurts it is awful
the other part of me is saying why stop there you have done that before a long while back why not go further what is the point
even through all rumours or lies he made me smile even when twice or thricewe spent a good time and shared a great bond and made each other more strong and strong
they do not know how i am feeling and like i said we are not super close either so i do not think they are really care much anyways
i have been trying for a long time to overcome this but sometimes it just feels impossible i do not think there is ever been a time in my life that i loved myself even as a kid i would criticize myself constantly it is hard to try and change things now
1 i am a very organized person i plan everything starting from the second i wakeup i plan what i am going to do that day what i am going to eat when what time etc and when somebody mostly my mom goes in my way and for example invites someone over the house or tells me i have to go somewhere or just anything that makes me have to change my schedule or change the time i am going to shower or something etc i get incredibly frustated to the point where i breakdown cry and lock myself in my room
i do understand and i am trying to change that i do not know if this is the right place to post this please guide me if it is not
it is christmas eve tomorrow my mum is super strict with polish traditions so i will have to fast until 7pm and i will have to wear formal posh clothing all day she is really narcissistic and manipulative
even though i really should not i miss him i am starting to think medication might be the answer i should feel like life is good
i have been struggling with ptsd for the last 10ish years 2 officially diagnosedi am so lost and could use some words of encouragement
i am not special i can only destroy never create i try to do good but i do not know anything so i just screw up
in a year where many peers seem to be plagued by loneliness and isolation and feel stretched with work from home i feel happy
people are all talk but no action yes i can not expect anything from anybody however if you tell me you are open to hearing me then later ignore me you should not have said anything
i have never been this vulnerable this fast but if it is too much he knows now i am really fed up with my life i do not control anything
i am a 16 year old boy with no friends believable maybeit is really over this time there is nothing more i can do
i feel so completely broken and lost like i am just now waking up from a strange sad dream i hear his voice constantly everything reminds me of him whatever i am doing i imagine him there experiencing it with me i want to contact him so badly even though he does not want me to my anxiety is at an all time high
i do not even want to go to work because i am so scared i have never not trusted him like i do now
i have no one else to stay here with me today he asked me to please stop talking to him at all
she continued to tell me that while she did need space that if she saw improvement she saw no reason why we could not get back together
i just wanted to say mental abuse can affect anyone and will brake anyone giving the right ingredients and just because mental issues does not mean that you need to put other people beneath you and treat your self that your above the law or gods second hand man or entitle your self or think that your better than everyone just be kind and true to your self
please tell me what i can do to better my chances and do not tell me not to sleep with him my mind has been completely made up
never dated anyone per say but had my fair share of mutual likingshe finally she arrived at the city and we went out
she ignored this message and immediately tweeted than she and her bf were meeting with a realtor i do not know if she read my message but i think she did
ladies be honest with me is there no hope here if you caught your bf subbing to an onlyfans would that be a dealbreaker for you i need closure desperately
i know our relationship was not perfect and i was hurt over the course of it otherwise it would have worked out but part of me wishes i was not the way i am so it could have worked
i made sure i was qualified for the school that i applied in and i took every steps carefullynow i have no way to go abroad for studying i have to stay in south korea
i quickly realized though that i was not only no longer good at the game but i simply had no idea how to move my character one of the most basic parts of the game
i am a firm believer real love is never a straight road and that love is an action the emotions are not cemented and rough patches can be improved by actions
help me out that i will find someone better and that it is him not me i did not understand why he was saying this
my girlfriend broke up with me recently seemingly out of the blue to me this is the second time she has done it
i am depressed but who do i tell that in a world where everyone has something i hate that i feel nothing doing things i loved
2dealing with a really shitty schoola shit ton of anxiety4the thing that tops the cake suicide issues tried to kill myself about 4 times
i am thinking about ending it because i am tired of all the pain i experiance and deal with on a daily basis
hell who cares about sex whatever the heck that is it is been so long i really do not care what is worse i am a physical person
he asked me what did you lose because he could not let me know in the few days time i even told him to not make sexual comments at me i am not comfortable and barely feel emotionally connected to even consider doing anything sexual but each day he acted like i am denying him something he is entitled to
it is become too much to handle that never even making it to a first date let alone someone giving me the chance to be together long enough to figure out whether it will actually work or in the meantime at least trying to connect through emotional if not physical intimacy that i feel left with nothing but this extreme dichotomy between completely isolating myself even more than current times require in the ultimate move to be as avoidant as possible or taking a huge risk by choosing to be with absolutely anyone no matter how terrible they are for me or how unattracted to them not just physically i am
i have never felt loved in my life i feel worthless and it is really fucked up to feel like this i yearn to love and to feel loved i am hopeless romantic that still believes in true love even if that has never happened to me and probably never will
everything together makes my daily life a living hell i am loosing my mind i am lonelier than i was ever before
today we had a videochat call with a couple of friends i got ready put on a new dress make up jewelry just because of how excited i was i have not thought about my ex all day i was so excited about the call that i did not even care for my ex that makes me happy
even if i would go to er for suicide fear i would be charged heavily as any mental health concerns get immidiately rejected by insurance
the one place i feel normal sharing my feelings and they call this place a joke if you really had problems you would call a hotline
is this weird i am happier by myself but i still feel confused that i still do not want to hear from him that even if he came back and apologized i would not take him back i did the crying a long time ago before we broke up so i really have not gone through an extreme expression of grief since the actual breakup
i know there are people who actually like me and find me interesting my parents love me and support me but i can never believe in myself i do not feel that i am loved and people think i am interesting and care bout me and now i am a highschool senior trying to prepare for college and like i just want the rest of my life to be like the last twelve
actually the thing is i do not really want to lose contact with her even if we will maybe stop hearing from each other if that makes sense
as uncle iroh said life sometimes its like a dark tunnel but if you keep walking you migth eventually find a way out to a better place
i honestly do not know if i can really handle just sorta cutting off my friends or minimizing contact with them even if sometimes the friendship feels toxic
maybe it is not significant maybe 5 years mean more than a few compromising situations because most likely i am going to see something that is bound to hurt me
meanwhile my stepmom gets better and leaves the hospital but my dads condition worsens on the second third attempt to have him admitted he is put on a ventilator right away
my memories feel too far away i am way too much happier than i should be right now i am way too much in the exact minute of the present than i would ever been my whole live because i have always lived in the past
i am really struggling at the moment my whole life basically revolves around the trauma i experienced five years ago i tried telling her i thought i had ocd and she told me it was not
idk if i would recover from that my mental health is bad and tying myself to another person is not the way to fix it
there is a part of me that wants to live and it is in conflict with the part that wants to die if i am sure that i want to die i have no doubts that i will manage to but if i am hesitant or choose a different method with certain probability of survival i might as well not do it
what if the fact that sometimes i tell lies makes me a psychopath what if i am a bad person for picking nice things for myself and not for others
i still love her like i did and it does not feel like i can get over her i deleted all the pictures of us our dog that she kept everything that reminded me of her
but after 2 years or so i got a little better at controlling my urges of masturbation but it was only then that i realized what i had actually gotten myself into
my misguided ways of finding affection are not as special as i make them out to be in my head one affair is not going to replace what i feel but it has actually made me feel worse
i ask that question bc those seem to be my only options at this point due to the fact that getting covid is basically inevitable at this point since nobody in my shit hole country usa including my own mother seems to give a damn about anyone but themselves and they refuse to not spread this virus
there is no doubt in my mind that i want off this earth but i am just scared i know people are taught to have empathy but understand i am really struggling here
it worries me i know that i will never get myself together although i had to stop talking to my friends online
i have only been talking to her for a few days and i have seen her only once we talked for a few days and she mentioned how she was un adding everybody on the 27th so it is nothing personal i pushed it but she did not want to tell me why
do not ever feel like this when someone says they care for you they truly mean it i have been wailing and begging between sobs to nowhere in particular please let her stay
i have tried all my life but i am never going to get better and their lives would be materially better if i was dead
i still hate them for what they did they do not seem to have changed much they do the bare minimum and expect me to thrive i had a panic attack recently and they just treated me like i am crazy my stepfather told everyone i talked to that i am lying about everything
i told her everything i told everyth8ng to you guys too in the last post idk what guys i am talking to but i feel better this way so i can trick myself to someone listening to me
now with that out of the way let us talk about how you can actually rebuild or build your selfesteem like a healthy and mature individual put differently how you can rebuild it without unnecessary boasting and goalsetting morning affirmations frantic positive thinking or fist bumping 100 random people at an overpriced event so let us get into this
she was all over me we were talking about our futures and it really seemed like we had something i love my mom dad and sister they tolerate me and help me in everyway they can
i would think that she is doing this maybe to be manipulative but the thing with her is that she genuinely is supportive and caring she even told me that she is still here for me if i need support but also to not contact her
i wish they were around better people as much as i cannot take loneliness a part of me always tells me i do not deserve nice friends and that they should abandon me the first chance they get as long as they find someone better
everything feels like a giant task at the moment taking a shower feels impossible and when i finally manage it washing my hair is even harder
i was extremely overwhelmed and distraught at the time and felt that this was the right thing to do since we lived 2 hours apart and he would not give up his auto mechanic job for me
3 weeks after our anniversary she became cold again minimal texts or greeting for days and now here i am once again stuck in another city alone
so many red flags i do not know why i chose to ignore them and hoped otherwise i knew he was too good to be true

i am tired of having nobody i am tired of constantly opening instagram and tiktok seeing these me and the boys memes i have never had a group of friends before this shit hurts i constantly think i am defective i am always the quiet kid in the back of the class the only time people talk to me is when they ask if i am ok i am tired of saying yeah just did not get any sleep
i am afraid and can not live like this anymore but i am also terrified for anything to change help my hands and legs were even shaking a bit
her older brother used her on multiple occasions to get what he wanted at great expense to her the constant crying when the kids are asleep i am so lost and broken and do not know where to start
and lastly get perspective on your life by thinking about how your problem is connected to all of this to all of the things that these people you imagine are going through
but now that i need someone all of them are too busy only thing that kept me sane was online friend i met when traveling
it is amazing to me to observe others who seem so stable calm positive and happy i can not help but feel so sad and far away from that reality
running something visual ideally from a tv channel helps me with that sense of being connected but i do not want to watch those channels for the reasons i mentioned
and he just went on like it was nothing the 4 of them just i imagine going along like normal no clue for him what any of it did to me
i involuntarily mimic qualities i do not like in people but can not seem to mimic the positive yes i tried a med
i have been lonely for as long as i can remember1 i do not socialise much mainly because i do not drink what a joke this is
i wonder happens to a person if he is completely alone with zero human interaction and i mean zero just him in a room with only his thoughts for i do not know maybe a year
you were there for me when my dad died you helped me understand how emotionally abused i was by my narcissistic mother
i do not think your job is not important i know i said it but i know it is not truei hate christmas i am just a background character in so many peoples lives
then at eighty i will have the pleasure of looking back on a life of pain and wondering why i did not just off myself sooner
to talk to lay next to come home to share expenses with to do activities with and i am worried as well
since i was a child i would cry for hours on end heartbroken at the suffering and horror caused by the evil humans do to each other

i just do not know what is happening i hate to self diagnose but are these the early stages of psychosis what is wrong with me i do not take medication nor do i have access to therapy or any sort of treatment as of now
i was moments away from hitting my teacher when she did this she was beautiful the way she smelled her eyes
i feel like i need to stop spreading myself thin for others and focus fully on myself and those i care about
is he trying to intentionally hurt me because he thinks i cheated or has he truly moved on he barely responds to me even though i have tried to get us back together and apologize for my wrongs
until i realized something was off in our relationship it started off with fiery passion that quickly turned almost into one of those rdeadbedroom scenarios
she was super nice always including me in everything even texting me after school which was a major shock for me since no one ever messages me
it is been really bad the past few days but tonight i set a tiny goal for myself to do a certain number of pushups
yesterday i stayed in my room all day long because i had stayed in there for a few hours and i did not want to leave because i did not want him to remember i was in there and think i am lazy
although i wanted to make friends with germans and learn about the culture and language deep down i was not ready to let go of my american identity
i do not know how to be a good person or how to live like a normal teenager i can not see myself getting old and it scares me because living seems to be my only option
we were talking and do not remember the context but i said somthing in the lines of i am your 15ht choice
how do i make sense of the world after this how do i make sense of myself should i go to intensive care place like rehab i have had bad anxiety and bad panic attacks for a decade and never did anything concrete about them
i am 15 years old and i never dream even though i think people my age should dream a lot more is this unhealthy also i know that i probably dream but never remember them anybody know how i increase the chance of having a vivid dream
today he told me that he is not feeling the sexual connection and just wants to be friends and for me it is so hard to accept because i thrive on physical connection as well as mental but after finding out a few things i feel better and it feels like moving on is going to be easier than i thought
but i have no friends even when i was in a fraternity i could not connect with any dudei know i will probably die alone do not need a week set aside to be reminded of that
the emotional pain is not backing down it only increases with time and i honestly do not know what is all this and when and why did this happen i just want to get rid of all this pain
it just hurts so much it feels like i really lost a sister and i do not even know why i lost her
this means that if you take yourself to the cinema or make yourself a bubble bath just because some random dude on the internet told you to you are not really participating in selflove but if you do the same things because you enjoy doing them then you are doing selflove right
her dad also seemed disappointed and as usual whenever he is upset he does not speak to her and eventually told her she would miss me she did end up missing me until i put myself out there for her
disregard the nature of my account if you can this account basically i use to feed my ego when i feel fat and ugly
he is emotionally abusive and is constantly using darvo he is in the military and is always complaining about how much america sucks compared to china
i was already in not the greatest place over the past few years last year i prioritised on helping my mental health since i had a lot of spare time with no school or job for the most part but did find new hobbies that i sort of like
i had a very close friend but she got a boyfriend and now never talks to me i feel like i am always the one to ask people to hang out first or talktext people first
side note she has mild depression and is doing double to amount of online school that a normal person would plus works 4 days a week so i believe her word and i do not think she is just letting me down easy
i have never been on this subreddit before but i am on reddit constantly and was hoping the community would have some words of wisdoms for me thanks in advance
at the time it felt like the right idea and texted her saying i guess i needed to focus on moving on but i would still like to be a part of her life but part of me still wants to be with her and it hurts me to think i may never speak to her again as a result of this and will never connect with her in any capacity again
when she did it she told me that she thought we should just be friends now my parents are searching the trash can because they want to know why there is so much in there
i am a third year product design student and for one of my projects i am thinking of designing a board game to help with loneliness
with all that said i am ashamed to admit that i still love her like crazy hold no real anger against her and only want the best for her in the future
i already know most of you are going to say or at least think you are not a bad person you just have not been given a real chance to show others love
she broke up with me she said she is felt like we are growing apart for a while and she wants to be her own person
i want to reach out to her and i want to find the best friend in her that i had constantly found in her during our relationship
after a short time at my house i go back to my mums house because i think why am i sitting here alone i may as well sit with her
okay family when i fucking kill myself we will see who is attention seeking they just call me crazy and do not give a fuck about my mental illness
i have cried for a good two hours today over him because i still really really love him i just wish he would have left me alone to grieve and get over him when we broke up i have been holding this stupid hope in my heart that if i get my shit together i will finally be good enough for him but that is obviously never going to happen
anyone that is currently recovering how did you force yourself through the pit in your stomach that makes you feel like you can not take another bite should i take this seriously and notify my doctor
i do not have anyone else its not like i can meet any new ppl in this pandemic either and online dating is just a waste of time
tldr i broke up with someone a decade ago who could have been the love of my life but i have only started to come to terms with recently how much my own issues caused this to happen
we are very lovey together he ended up texting some old friends who he told me he had no interest in talking to
i did not realize that i knew i was a kind person and i did not intend for people to think of me that way
i have not seen this man in 2 months and i feel so alive i finally feel my sense of self coming back and even tho nobody is flirting with me or filling my ego i have never felt so confident
but i feel so stuck and i can not get out i have been to therapy for seven years and i feel as if i am just in this constant loop
every day i feel the same and i apply everything learned i feel weight on my shoulders none of it really worked
i hate myself i hate that i am not strong and intelligent like the othersdespite me making it really clear that i do not want to have any relationship with him she constantly
she also said that she wants nothing to do with me and that i should never contact her again because i tried to sabotage their relationship by insering myself between them it turns out he did not know about me before she told him its her exs profile that added him
what a wonderful way to start the christmas celebrations with a good cry me to sleep i wake up every day for the same shit to fucking get hit i want to die
he was willing to do something very few men on this earth would do he would tell me that i can move in with him whatever lengths it took
i have also discovered she started seeing someone else and already told him she loves him and introduced him to her parents after 2 months
i overthink everything when i am close to killing myself i tend to risk thingsmost days i can be positive towards my situation
i will stop now because i am getting uncomfortable thanks i do not even really have any goals i just want to function as a proper human and i can not
he said that he would be too distracted since then i just gave up and ended up acting as if i was enjoying it again
about 2 weeks ago jordan texted me talking about worries with us and things with my personal life i listened to her and i started to change my bad habits into good ones
why does not he care and how did he get over our breakup so quickly did all he want to do was hookup with me
my boyfriend does not know whoever she is trying to get a present for just google it if you are that stuck
i want to ask him to leave his office door open for a bit considering he is been doing all this while i am 10 feet away i can not stop thinking about all of this
but i wish i could still be a kid and have my parents protect me like they did this was going on well before the pandemic i have never been much of a joiner
keep trying you will find someone eventually you need to love yourself before others will love you that even if you are a mess i will not give up on you
i have tried to end my life multiple times but it never works out like i want someone to notice me like a attention seeker a twofaced person
i have been wondering if even though he has moved on to another girl and is trying to convince her she is not a rebound and is kissing her a week after dumping me
do not ever fucking call me or text me do not ever come up to me and act sorry or with feelings of regret
i 25m have realized that i can not actually think or for that matter do anything without writing it downi feel like i have no one to look forward to seeing after the quarantine ends
i swear to god it is really stupid but for some reason i can not stop thinking the worst and i am worried that everytime i make a decision that i want to make it will be this overwhelming because i do not have the energy to deal with this
hi i am actually writing a novel and i have 3 characters that have some mental health problems i did my own research on the subject but i think that hearing from a real person who has one would be better it would help me make it more realistic
there is not anything that beings me joy or any happy memories to keep me afloat or distracted from it no one i can trust to talk to who will not just hurt me more
not really like self harmsuil thoughts but just things like fuck i am a failure and i am going to end up alone and why did i have to be born with these mental issues that create problems in my relationships etc etc
or else people will just laugh at me i am a big loser instead he got me my own actual lemon water
i keep praying for things to get better for me to get the strength to move past this these feelings
do not you just hate it when you want to let something out but you got nothing to talk to i have friends sure but i feel like i do not belong anywhere
am i alone in this like the second my parents pass away i am going to end it and i am so excited
if anyone has some input i would love to hear it please be gentle with me lol i have been devastated ever since but slowly healing
as i feel my age creeping up on me my insecurities are spiraling out of control i am starting to get irrationally angry at conventionally attractive men
sometimes i cry all night because of what i go through all i can think of is do not want to die of loneliness and somehow survive
my job pays well and has great benefits but i absolutely hate it i want to leave so bad but i feel like i can not
still hurts tho as he has friends all over the town and i have to wait for him all the time when we run into someone and they starts chatting
i tried my absolute best for her i am hoping i can find a job soon but the job market is so terrible right now
it is not a actual pain or anything but it is like the emotional kind i have this awful feeling of dread and sadness i guess
last year she decided to leave my dad she had been cheating on him for a while and while at the time she said it was not because she was seeing anyone it turned out that she had been seeing somebody for quite a few months before leaving my dad she left him on christmas morning
instead of yelling at him i got up to check on him he had just taken half a bottle of pills and an entire bottle of vodka
i have been agitated and snippy and get mad very easily almost as if i am on steroids it is very unlike me since i am a chill person generally
the closest i came to happiness was with madison she seemed so perfect for me the journey of life is a process it has to be this way everything
but more recently i have been doing lots of psychedelics and the other night i did a few mushrooms and just started saying the things i only thought to myself and my friends looked at me like i was the joker but it only made me feel good to get it off my chest and to have someone confirm that there was something wrong with me it is weird but being told i am mentally disturbed made me feel sane for the first time because i could not doubt it and i think that doubt had made me a much more paranoid and second guessing pourpose
till the end of my semester i had to stay in contact with him because of projects now we have blocked each other but we are in a group with just us two
at the moment i have tons of exams to write tasks to do topics to study and i have only 4 days what advice would you give for studying what advice would you give me in general to improve my mental health
i think i would be very good at everything compared to anyone else new to this concept since i can not remember myself ever being happy even though i was diagnosed just last summer
i am the eldest child i do not have any aunts or uncles that i am close with so pretty much i basically had to raise myself in a way
i have begun to think that people who want me to stay are the ones who are selfish i have left religion which has removed a considerable amount of the guilt to stay
i have surrounded myself with strong and loving friends and have accomplished many things that make me feel happy eg public speaking film making volunteering
then not remembering any of what i say during the episode this time however i started having those same experiences except without the fever
he moved out for 3 weeks came back apologized and said it was a mistake6 months down the line i discovered that he was still communicating and still seeing the other woman
from the start the girlfriend was upset at not being the only girl anymore and literally expressed this to my ex and everyone but me such that the brother and her boyfriend also did not put much effort into getting to know me even though i did try
after she read that she began asking questions such as why i do not want a relationship any time soon and when do i reckon i want to start being in a relationship with someone again a friend of mine said he thinks she is thinking twice about leaving me as it seemed like her supposed relationship was just her trying to get you talking about your love life
this is mostly just venting because i do not even know what to do at this point so i am putting everything i have into this
he said he want to preparing his future and want to be alone not loving anyone idk you always knew how to make me cry i do not want you i just want someone like you
i still think about the countless times i questioned if you even cared about me at all of course i miss you
i need to be numb and distracted those are the only times that i feel as though i truly enjoy life
it does not because me any anxiety to make decisions based off of this because it seems that he is the only thing motivating me
last night i had a nice dream where i had someone who loved me someone who i could cuddle up with and just relax someone who i could talk to
i neglected my own mental health for someone who was always in it for themselves i am working on making me love me for me
even if she told me she wants to get high sleep with other people she is bisexual i even told her she can sleep with girls if she wants because it does not bother me too much at least that is something that makes sense that i can understand
it was kind of a long process about 2 months of thinking and weighting things but he decided he could not do this anymore and i agreed
it is not in attempt to persuade myself not to nor inform others it is just and it hurts so much i loved her with all my heart
i thought i was going to marry her i was looking at rings she seems like she is already moved on and over us
no it is not this or that happened and that is why no it is my fucking fault and i do not mean that as a judgement
i had everything i ever wanted back then a wife two daughters and a house for some reason mental illness made itself known
so i rolled with that for a while until i found out that this feeling in my head affected me in a lot more ways than i realized
how the actual fuck do i deal with this problem i can not just stay in my room and avoid him like the black plague but he is going to be here christmas day after like noon or so
being at home is just awful every day i just wish to get away from home to just leave the pain behind me but there is nowhere for me to go i rarely have free time to myself only time i have free time is st nights there are just so many things wrong at home and there are lots of more things wrong
but when it comes to identifying psychological issues involving myself it will be nearly impossible to think clearly but somewhere deep inside i am still waiting for her
it is not fair i truly want to end my lifei need someone to talk please chat with me it is the sheer weight of my crushing emotional pain that causes it
i am just still in a lot of pain i do not want him to find someone else i am holding out for things to get better because i can not feel guilt free about killing myself either
i was not so chronically bored i was imaginative and found joy in small things as kids do i am getting tired of thinking this way it is even affected me a lot lately
on one hand my work helped me to ignore my lonleness and i thought that i did not need friends or people around me when my work was fun
they wanted a break to let things settle and i complied for a while through mutual friends i found out they had been flirtatious and implicit with other people during the break
why things have been going so well i just got out of the hospital i got a new job my partner has been supportive my friends and family are learning more about me and not leaving me
but they are booked up rn and i can not get one rn without my dog its like i am loosing my mind its hard coming to terms that she is gone
i know how hard it is i have many past regrets and mistakes and to this day i try and become the best version of myself
we would hangout every other day our sexual chemistry was perfect and i think it was the most exciting and stable thing that i had been in for a long time
and she will feel as if she failed as a mother and that she did something wrong and she did not everything that has ever happened to me has been my fault
i have sent over a hundred applications for different jobs and still ami feel like crying but i know that is not going to do anything
my heart was broken into tiny pieces after she did that all the hopes and dreams that i had were crushed and i felt like nobody will ever love me
since our relationship was long distance i have no way to see her other than a plane ticket to her destination and i also have her blocked on every social media i use but i have her email
i had not gone out or even spoken to anyone other than tutors at my college and even that i had to drop out of because of mental health reasons
religion has absolutely cursed my mind and i need an escape so i can see my brother again idk if i am crazy or what but help me
i am scaredi am a shitty personi do not want to hurt heri have been recently spamming her a lottalking about suicide and self harm and telling her stuff like i do not deserve a friend like her etc
but one day after an house party my colleague made a move on me and i gave in and we had sex
always reminding me of how shit i am i do not even deserve pity because i was a bully too it struck me as something that someone with low self esteem and an unhealthy means of communication would do
after i got back to the shit pit i called a home at the time 20 minutes passed i had the phone call i did not want to hear my grand father passed on i snapped inside punching every wall door and window bloody was dripping on my floor before my fiancé at the time came home after she heard what happen
honestly she talks shit about alot of people behind their backs so i would not be surprised if she did the same to me
i did not know anything but i remember that for years he had her contact on his phone to this day i do not know to what extent he was involved with her
i do not want to live like this i want to change how i think i want to be happier and do interesting things rather than sit at home all day in a constant state of fear i am trying to change things but i need help and the doctorstherapists do not seem to give me that
whenever i step into any room i look for any sharp object or anything i can because myself mortal harm with
she moved up during our relationship but then a few days later we had an argument about her wanting to try psychodelics and ketamine on an occassional basis
i have decided to no longer interact with anyone in my life as i truly feel like interacting with them is completely detrimental to my mental health
by the end of march b of of m my suffering ended or so thought i that being said i really just need a distraction i miss the attention
even when i do say i understand it does not make it hurt any lessi did not know how hard this would be to write
he called me parasite for trying to talk with him that is hurts about you dying the most painful and brutal death while i smile and laugh at your last moments
i am going to drop my cats and ferret off at a coworkers house i am going to come back home lock the doors lock the windows i am going to lay down in the bathtub and slit my wrists this will be my only suicide note god knows that nobody will read i anyways
because i feel like i am being attacked i essentially go into self defense mode and i attack back but really there was nothing to attack back to because there was no attack in the first place after a while how long it takes has been getting better but i would like for the situation never to happen again i calm down and come to my senses about how i have been and how stupid the whole situation is and then feel like shit for causing such a massive emotionally exhausting argument for no reason
this cycle has repeated so many times before that i feel like my head has been at the surface glimpsing the sun on the otherside for as long as i can remember
i lost my parents at a young age subconsciously she was a bit like a mom to me i realize she is nitpicking me and finding reasons to sabotage our relationship
while drunk she also said that she did not think we were soulmates and if were not soulmates than what is the point of even dating
i started lifting weights when i was 10 years old but around 9th grade puberty finally hit and so those couple years of form training really paid off in that i got fit quickly and without much trouble
where am i anymore idk just kill me already why they intentionally made me suffer it feels when they could have stopped it
second being that i just love him that way all i wish for is his happiness i forgot about myself and my needs the day i met him
i also feel a little bit stalkerish because i sometimes search her name on google on her school website or on her city news but i just want to know that she is not
this post is because i want the thoughts to stop i do not want to turn violent it is strange because part of me wants that to happen i also want to feel certain emotions and want to care about people but like half of me likes how everything is and does not want me to change
hi all thought you might like this blog and video on easy gratitude for improved mood and wellbeing i was fortunate to interview an expert on gratitude prof paul mills for the blog and video hope it helps
then when i was asleep this morning my mum had been checking the letterbox and my sister who i have not seen in years had been parked across the road now i am worried she is going to turn up again when i am awake or something i do not want to see her for personal reasons
i have thought of myself as a narcissist and a pessimist while simultaneously caring for the world and bleeding my heart out to and for others and giving the shirt off my back
unpleasant feeling i am feeling some emotional pain that i am going through right now i need to work through this
i am not sure why i am even posting here aside from it being the only suicide related subreddit i could find i suspect the rest were removed from the platform
grabbed my phone pressed the power button the screen goes on and there it is my wallpaper that is all i see nowadays no notifications no calls just plain wallpaper i go to sleep just cuz i get an escape from this empty void tired of hugging a pillow to fill the emptiness i need someone someone who i can love care for and get it back aswell
i just have a hard time getting over the fact that he never stuck up for me and that i always felt out of place even as time went on
i am in my late 20s and have had major depression for over a decadeeven if i wake up tomorrow i will probably damage my organs or something or i will vomit
lastly i have extremely low selfesteem i always have i hate who i am and what i have done with my life and the decisions i have made i am always distant with everyone including my own family i never went out with them because i feel like i will be judged everything i do i am just scared of being judged someone please just tell me what is wrong with me
i am physically able and for gods sake i am a white male in 2020 living in america the most privileged kind of person there is
so after 2 years i decided to change completely start a new career laws something very far from me but just for the dream of becoming something totally different from what i was which i failed but the feeling of having already failed never abandoned me
i am going to search the house for firearms too if i find a gun i will be definitely pulling the trigger instantly i have the courage for that
same goes for the few friends i have left every day is kind of a struggle to find any meaning in life alone but it is hard
not my boyfriend not my friends not strange men and certainly not myself like he had never looked at anyone like he had looked at me but i lost that
we met like 6 years ago on tinder and we talked for a year then decided to stop talking for 2 years till i got in college and i decided to reach out again
a lot has happened since then and i think i will rant about it one by one i am sorry i feel like this will be way too long
i literally only today symphysed with all the people who get addicted to certain stuff it is definitely not easy goddamn your silence and inaction
i really do not believe i would ever take my own life at this point i fear death i fear never having the chance to live a happy life
i blew out on her for not telling me how serious she was with that other guy and that she is a btch for to keep her company while she takes photos to share with a guy that she met playing the game that i bought her on a computer that i built for her
is there anyone coz i am missing her can not even sleep any real genuine one that is always there for me people are only there when they need something
i have always been a little cautious with love because i feel like a lot of people do not know what love is really like especially at a young age i am 18 she turns 17 in exactly a month
and it does not matter how much i tried to rationalize it i still feel like and idiot and have been nervous the whole day and do not want to think about it
sorry for the rambling just wanted to put this out there maybe i will make it through to new years maybe not no ones going to cry over me anyway and i would probably just be more of an inconvenience for the landlord to get my body out of the apartment and into the cremation oven oh well that is life
but i have been at home with my parents since then 3 years ago i sleep eat play work dinner relax all in my room since then
he is currently in another country for 2 years abroad and i found out recently that he shares the romantic feelings i feel towards him
this is when i kind of realized as much as i cared for her and how much she meant to me i only mattered to her when she wanted guaranteed attention and that i was just an option
last year i have been diagnosed with depression recently my friend told me about bipolar disorder and he said that i 100 have it
i have dealt with my mental health mostly on my own since then i have been given a few diagnoses from my doctor but i have never seen anyone regularly
i am trying to avoid him noticing the attack or me posting this i called it off for the right reasons i did not want to i had to
my therapist is super booked right now and i feel like google is not doing the trick for me here considering the fact that this is sort of a complex situation
i had a dream today in which my ex contacted with me we do not have contact for 9 months because of a argue and everything between us was ok i remember that we have become really good friends and we could trust each other altought we were not together anymore i just liked the fact i could talk to her and finally had a friend
now that almost everyone left me my life is likei do not abuse i am not a junki or whatever like trying to date again stopping probably led me to delve deeper into mmo games
i deleted the twitter app off my phone but still have my account open so i can access it on my laptop if need be for instagram i removed the shortcut on my home screen and after i use it i log out of my account to make it more of a hassle to check
then i ended up in a facility where i exposed why our elders are dying in nursing homes from covid not the current false narrative of they are old frail
i could endure all of that if i had familybut my mom has decided to stop talking to me a few days before christmas
i would be fucking bulimic if i was not such a pussy with vomit i fucking hate food man its disgusting but of course i live with an italian family because just my fuckin luck innit we have had pasta twice this week add today and tomorrow four fucking times i hate pasta i hate sauce i hate living and i hate pretending i do not hate living just so i can appear sane fuck you and fuck christmas
what is it for to work for most of my adult life and buy a house i can not afford and deal with the overwhelming amount of pollution and climate anxiety and fucking photoshop and shitty people that are only nice because they want something from me it does not get better
not actual porn that is porn does the thing porn does but it really does fuckall for the feelings of loneliness
we both have good jobs and make decent money other than his physical disability spinal cord injury paraplegia we are healthy i have great family that are very loving and supportive though my mum died when i was 12 his family are in england which is kind of a good thing for both of us
i will be sitting in a car and suddenly i visualise myself in the driver seat driving into pedestrians if i am walking past people in school i feel to just fight someone but idk why
but i feel like i do not have any good friends i could rely on right now being in my room feels different
anyone else enter 2020 with the person they thought they were going to marry but instead got heartbroken and ended up spending 2020 healing and getting over them same
i might facetime with my friend today but idk i requested the day off and am off today so that is good
i am trapped i cannot leave him my son is young and its almost impossible to rent apartment as single mother here and offcourse i cannot aford this alone
in instagram i took her last name for fun and i forgot to change it and then one of her friends texted me
do not have a job so could not even talk to people about that instead i had to listen to them talk and pat each other on the backs about their jobs
what do you struggle with the most when it comes to interacting with someonelet us discuss here i am sure that we can share some valuable advice
i noticed that despite my best efforts my mental health is deteriorating especially during christmas i am in a complete new environment
i have tried to reach out and call for help but no one seems to be listening i know my family would be very sad about my death but i can not take this anymore
watching shows like the end of the fuking world and sex education probably has not helped either but i know these stupid shows are just over the top rom coms
i normally love the holidays but ever since thanksgiving everything has just felt dull and pointless my grandfather almost died of covid and i miss my family very much i try to be jolly but it just feels like worse than a normal time
i am not suicidal i do not want to die life is too beautiful for me to waste it like that nowadays i find myself more at ease with animals and nature than with other humans but at the end of the day it is just another façade that goes away whenever i partake in my responsibilities because truth is that humans are built for that
i blame it on social anxiety disorder but maybe i am just an uninteresting twat is there sadness yes there is sometimes there is even victimhood
when i hear keys down the hall it feels like i am waiting for you to come homei can not take living this fake life i do not deserve my friends and i do not deserve anything i have
my girlfriend says that it does me good to do things like that more often and i know that it will but right now i just physically can not
no one sees me as a long term option or loves me for real i have been reading a lot of posts from this group to gain insight and find advice
he even talked about how this female celebrity was hot in front of me and when other people in the call were being kind of mean he did not say anything to me at all
we will maybe for some time enjoy it but like 10 yrs later or more when our faces will reseble one large wrinkle
some days i feel numb about everything and just zone out a lot and other days i feel on top of the world as stupid as that sounds
it is like other people are not aware of what they are missing and do not really think about the nature of their happiness or sadness or anything like that but i do
no one cares to even answer me it hurts because i never do that shitwhy i am wasting my time with such thoughts when i should be happy and i know it
i mean i will be more than happy to be her friend not asking for much so how can i keep this relation going after going out with her that one time
i was 16 years old and i just moved on to another country with my family trough all that time i was checking fourtheyenethttpsfourtheye
maybe i keep it going too long am too eager to talk i will admit insta was my go to when i was bored
cos buddy who is drop you in first hole you strucked its bad budd but actuallyi was sometime using some shit amph for no sleep hashmarihuana for good jokes etc
i do not want to fucking exist anymore no matter how much i try to do good and make progress i always fuck it up
she worked with this new guy and when she would become distant i would blow up her phone pleading and rebuke her for cheating and still engaging in conversationinteractions with him
i woke up with the realization today that the reason i have problems socializing and making friends because i have huge expectations
i was constantly riddled with what ifs and all kinds of crazy scenarios in my head and it was hard for him to keep up with it
when it comes to hard times it can be a daunting task to move forward fear only seems to grow stronger with no sign of slowing losing faith not only in the world and in the future but in yourself
i do miss him very very rarely whenever i feel a little lost or alone my mind thinks about him but i reassure myself of why and what is truly happening in me and direct my awareness to the fact that it is not fully him
it does not hurt as much as i thought it would because i have been losing feelings and getting over him for a month and a half now but tonight i thought about that moment i thought about how he treated me at the beginning of our relationship
recently i have really been thinking about how nice it would be to die and escape life periodically she would shit on me on twitter but that has ceased
due to being out of work i was forced to get masshealth i have had to do this before back in 2013
i do not want to hurt myself i think the unknown scares me but i can not seem to find a good reason to run from danger
1 it is her best friends she hangs out with her a lot and that could be who the other person is also it makes sense that the cat would be over there because i have seen that she brings it to her friends all the time this seems very likely however
but then again i do not like sharing my feelings because it is like having to walk around naked we had lots of fun together but he claimed he did not love me i was really bitter about this
i went on a walk i played with my pets i called suicide hotline i hugged my girlfriend i got high i listened to music and i ate some food i thought those were supposed to fix things then how come i still desperately want to die i did everything my therapist said to do when i want to attempt but this time nothing worked
i hitted rockbottom a week and a half ago i had a nervous breakdown and started having suicidal thoughts called an ambulance just in case
i am pretty in shape but i have even started working out so much more so maybe i can hold a flame to these celebrities but i know it is pointless
i am so scared to live life without her by my side and she zaid some things that were extremely hurtful and just not true
try and make it so people care about me even if i will never have a relationship then again i do not know if i have the strength for that either
not until i went through her phone a couple days back and saw some chats i was not supposed toi confronted her about it and she became all defensive and in a bid to still have her around i found a way to make everyone happy myself inclusive
as we were getting ready to go to the market i really was not feeling good and i did not want to walk a long distance in a mask i have breathing problems from anxiety
i am surrounded by deranged awful sexist men and the women around me are so broken they can not care about me because they themselves need help they are all like empty shells
i do not know if this is the right place i want to help him but i worry it would just hurt him more if i try
she is in a home after a stroke and heart attack after liverkidney failure i realize i cannot help her or any until i do for myself its pointless to even try
i want to talk to someone i really want to talk to someone about my suicidal thoughts but i do not want to worry anyone and i just
i do not hate myself anymore i worked really hard to overcome that but i still do not like myself i have zero selfconfidence and it affects my everyday life so much
my mood gets ruined and i get sent into a state of negative thoughts and feelings like anger sadness and feeling like trash based on what they said
than he told me he jumped off a building are not nothing worth a dam without someone to share it with
i often hear really great stories about therapy and i am glad it is working for a lot of people in my experience some mental health professionals just are not that great to me at least some have definitely made things worse broke my trust and said horrible things to me or did not take me seriously when i talked about some issues
i remember siting in a room with other hospitalized people watching trump announce the national emergency for covid19 they tried to change my medications to the bare basics
i told myself everyday that if me and my best friend of 17 years did not make it that i would immediately try and talk to my ex gf of 3 years just for the fact that i wanted to redeem myself for abandoning my daughter
i get to wear a mask in pharmacy again and make people think i like them and that i care about their dick problems but i am done medications are not working therapy is worthless and all i am doing is making everyone is life a living hell i am not living i am existing and i can not live this way anymore
irl nobody cares nobody wants me i m just a fucking outcast shit i have no real friend i try to talk with few but always just end up left alone aside outcast i never got call from any of friends since last 3 months of lockdown
ahhh man this sucks i wish i could have just been normal i wish i could have had a good friend group been a good person someone that others looked up to and i wish i could have helped a lot of people i wish i could have fallen in love with someone had a family travelled the world learned languages be creative grow old and die content
is it hard to let her go if so what is the most challenging part about it what is the strongest emotion you feel while you draw
and the guy i am dating i still like but just not as much anymore we barely text because whenever i try he leaves me on read or i get some annoying sexual comment
3 weeks after that she unfollows me on all social media she said she can never hate me that we can still be friends someday but it is just best for us to move on seperately
to the point i procrastinate and find a distraction i will maybe go and watch some tv or youtube videos and feeling just vanishes
sometimes i either feel too much or nothing at all i do not want to die but i do not want to necessarily live either
trouble feeling like i belong to any group i have many individual friends with whom i have oneonone relationships and will temporarily be part of different groups
he told me he had trust issues he spent the night i think i am okay from it but i am not sure what this means
i just feel like i am such a different person because i can not even enjoy the things i used to enjoy a can not feel things i used to feel and i lost people that were really close to me and it did not affect me like i thought it would i thought i would feel pain or i would miss them but i was just indifferent
i always felt bad alone and i have practically no friends finding a soul mate turned out to be much more difficult than i imagined
after a lot of recent fights i feel very burnt out i am afraid of i ask for time alone she will become suicidal
the days you surprised me at work and brought lunch or just to give me a hug on the bad days
instead of telling yourself i am so stupid for reaching out to my ex today with a sappy text you could say i acted like a dumbass but everyone does that at some point it is ok
i have tried having celebrations but no one is ever interested they claim they are too busy or just not in the mood
anyways ever since i was 16 i have wanted to date someone went to a different school did not click with anyone got a job did not click with anyone
crying because i was so damn worried about you 2 years i got expelled from my previous school for that reason
love never treated me well my first ever relationship i was physically and verbally abused then taken advantage of and raped and i never thought in this cruel world love ever truly existed but you swept me off my feet and showed me it existed
he thanked me for being so understanding and lovely and we agreed that we would give each other back our stuff that got caught up in the middle
hate myself more than i can describe everything i create or touch or say the words i am typing now are repulsive beyond description
i think i was doing the right thing by always making sure she was alright always offering my help and support and we were celebrating every one of her and my small victories together
in these 3 months i started taking pills and smoking weed because i thought that it would help me to take her off my mind
more specifically someone i used to be in love with it is been almost 3 years since we broke up we would even exchange phone numbers but as soon as my semester ends people stop talking to me
its really affecting my grades and concentration levels and i am trying to not make my family suspicious i just need some tips if anyone has some on how to get over her faster
but when i get chance to socialize and make some friends i just get quiet anxious and weird and have zero motivation to make effort to be friendly after that i usually hate myself for not talking enough and the cycle always repeats
i do not know what to do anymore they are literally seems like no good reason to live life is torture the emptiness and the sorrow just never ends
no it is not my upbringing no it is not this or that happened and that is why this sounds so dramatic but it is really how i am feeling and i just needed to get it out ig
for context she has a history of faking stuff my only source to know this is from a blog that she writes but does not let anyone in the family read
i want her to be happy though i know that is what love is about i just do not know how i will get past this at this point
sometimes he helps with advice sometimes he can just hug if we meet when we parted he did not leave me online but invited me to take a walk
it is physically painful too and i hate it i can not drink anymore either or it just gets 10x worse i do not want to go on living anymore i fuck everything up for everyone
i have not heard today from him and i can not check yet if he is seen it i hope breaking nc for that was worth it i gave my final shot i had more things to say than i did in the letter but making it too long is also too much
i talk very fast i walk very fast and the worst is i can never enjoy a moment because i keep thinking what i am going to do next
last year in october my girl left me on our anniversary via text i am still recovering to say the least she left as apparently i stopped loving her and insisted i was a terrible boyfriend
i also struggle with anorexia bpd n a depressive disorder so i am really scared that being alone in total isolation will jus bring all the bad shit up again
does it make me a bad person if this is what i am most afraid of her giving to someone else i can cope with her giving these other things to someone else because i have had time to heal from those pains already
i think i have tried everything there is to try to improve my situation from reading philosophy and literature to getting addicted to video games but nothing seems to do it
i do not even want gifts or any of that stuff just someone to be around that might actually care about me for once
the person she was with was a really nice person at first but it slowly turned into a deceiving relationship and eventually she found out that he was lying to her about something the whole time
i do not deserve to be here i am not a good person and i do not think i will ever become a good person
i keep telling myself that i am over it but deep down i know i am not the whole breakup was extremely traumatizing to me and it has changed a lot
i do not know is this is just me but i regret so so much i regret doing a lot of things i have
i feel like i should not have them anymore since i do not have much attachment to you anymore but getting rid of them or at least all of them i imagine will take a long time
that ended up being the first time in over a year that i cut myself on the upside i got incredibly productive for two days afterwards just to spite him
he said yes and that they have been unofficially dating for 3 days so i was really hurt that a day after we broke up she got with someone else did not tell me that she broke up because of him and that have been dating while we still were and she never told her friends about us in the first place but that part was not so bad
i have big goals and aspersions and part of me knows i have what it takes to do something great with my life the other half of me thinks my heads in the clouds and life is too hard to aim high for anything i am being torn apart between myself for a while now and it fuckin sucks
do not know why i am posting on here well maybe because its 2020 and this year fucking sucks literally nothing good has come out of it and to add icing to the cake my girlfriend and i broke up last night just fuck 2020
my girlfriend 21f and i 21m broke up recently after almost 2 years of dating and i am not taking it well
i am glad you were able to realize we needed to breakup before we got to the point where we hated each other
is like limiting yourself to only doing the same thing over and over again foreveror did a new world start when this universe start
and i do not think that you would eat a raw garlic clove for me anymore and it is time that i admit that to myself
i said let us move on i am here to help i am hurt but i love you no one truly loves me they just see me and think they love an idea of me
well i hope she lives a good life with whoever she ends up being with i am sorry that i can not be in it but that is the way that life is
she wants to stay in my life but we have decided to give each other some space to adapt to being friends i am heartbroken even though we would only been together a few months i really had a good feeling about her
right now i do not want to try and kill myself again but i do not know what to do to make sure that does not happen
our 2 year old is so very smart and silly and just plain happy our 6 month old always has a smile on his face and loves to laugh
if anyone has struggled with depression in the past and has any suggestions for little ways to help it would be greatly appreciated
she was and still is a saint she is so ambitious smart funny generous caring thoughtful and literally everything i have ever wanted in a wife
i can not stretch enough how many times latelaturs and the lines like all this pain is an illusion helped me trough life
we were together 6 years lived together for 4 a month and a half ago she said she was not in love with me anymore ha that rhymed it was a killer my emotions went wild i lost 20lbs over night and did not sleep for nearly 3 days
but a couple of nights ago i had the worst anxiety or depressive episode i think i have had yet pacing around my house thoughts racing through my head letting my incredibly caring parents listen and care for me all night i am absolutely terrified of another attack
i will be there if she needs me but right now i just want to do is curl up and feel safe with her
saw him outside when i was leaving and same thing happened but he added that i am crazy damaged uptight and that and he sees no future with me
my mother is trying to get me to move back in and i have attempted to set boundaries but each one is trampled on and disrespected and i do not know what to do
anyway we ended things but i can not stop thinking about him and feel like i will never move oni would like to apologise for my broken english anyways let me break it down
you have made it so clear you have decided your life is better without me in it and i have to accept that
the doctors told us he would be fine and we went home with him i do not remember much of the summer after that
how can i make this work i do not have a clue how can fix it ahhh fuckkkkkkkkkk meeeee i am in my mid 20s and have been moving around alot the past 5 years
when i went back to school last fall i was depressed and my coping mechanism was weed usage the porn had stalled our sex life and she felt i was uninterested or found her unattractive
i have gone to a psychiatrist but i stopped seeing him before we made any real progress it was simply too expensive
i felt so unimportant in his life and when i told him it was received as an attack on his skills as a boyfriend
i do not know why she felt the need to try to leave without saying bye but i know she loves me so much
today he told me a story that was rather sexual in nature and later he told me that he got blocked by someone let us call them q
i am panicking about it all and i could just imagine how he feels and it hurts me because i do not want him to go through it and i can not stop thinking about when he starts hugh school becaue i know that he might get bullied and stuff
i am feeling like this and it is not stopping i am just reassuring myself that it will all be over on new years eve because i plan to kill myself then and jump off my roof i am just so tired of everything to me i do not see a reason to live
i came to the conclusion that life indeed is suffering but it is a beautiful suffering for the past three years dealing with depression has been a mental cancer not saying that depression is worse than cancer or vice versa they are terrible in their own ways dealt with adhd my whole life porn addiction since 10 and friends i am pretty sure we are all struggling with something in a different way
i felt it happening again and was on the phone with my friend and i kept going in and out for 2 hours
started smoking went to weed and now to cigarettes work at a job that does not pay me enough i never want to hurt people
we spent hours laughing and smiling whether it was watching meme compilations watching anime going to thursday dinners with her family playing video games or just discussing books and movies
i am just being realistic forget being optimistic aka false hopeeverything sucks a bit more than usual lately i feel like i genuinely have no one
i told her i did not understand i would given her space i would tried to be supportive but i was feeling a little taken for granted
i was even paranoid to see a therapist that he would tell everyone i am messed up and that it is all my fault
my boyfriend feels sometimes like lost when overthinks he is not able to express his feelings and he just changed his attitude to me from when i met him to when we started dating
i just want to tell you that you are not alone if you want to have a conversation about anything my dms are open if you want to talk about a problem that you have or a passion that you discovered or a dream that you want to pursue let me know i am genuinely interested on talking about that
but the depression also takes over when i have the opportunity to go out and do something i just feel stuck and really lonely and sad
i knew she occasionally did drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine but i smoke weed and have experienced with stronger substances as well so i did not mind it too much furthermore she rarely did them so it was not an issue for me
every step i get closer to it the less i want to to jump but as i move away from it i regret not jumping because i really do not want to go home and be alone with my thoughts
i tried telling her i thought i had ocd and she told me it was not i tried to i know that i can not blame anyone else but myself
italy was put in total lockdown for 3 months straight and then problems started to arise we both suffered mentally for the distance his mother worsening condition my grieving and the overall pandemic going on
i have been taking fluoxetine at 40mgday and occasionally i am nauseous when eating and will vomit has anybody else had similar reactions with ssris
feelings are the mirror of our soul in action of our behavior senses coming to life you could embrace a feeling an emotion and go straight into the storm
i had a brake down and i have not been the same sense when someone so close to you stabs you in the back it hits different
anyone feel boring in quarantine dm me let us have some funi have this feeling all the time maybe it is loneliness maybe emptiness
so my history w libra men is seeing a pattern of acting out with hate towards you and the world because of something even if you did not deserve it
i cannot understand how a grown ass woman who is also a doctor can morally torment her loved ones like this
this year has given me the lowest lows but in the last half i pushed forwards and have understood that the only way to fight back against lowest lows is with the highest highs
its so annoying not being able to enjoy the best time of my life and i know that there will be a moment that will come and i will regret wasting the good times with overthinking useless things but it will be too late
i no longer think that even with all the work i have done all the work still to come that there will be a goal worth holding at the end
everything i try to do fails everything i do have breaks everyone i have in my life is quick to leave it
a house we can decorate the way we want have what we want here and a place we can truly call ours
i am part of a team which has taken an initiative to help out lonely people here is a survey it will be great if you guys can fill it out as it will give us some insight httpsdocsgooglecomformsde1faipqlsciorcsr3sodhgaqctuzumhpf96pgdfrkezr5b0oowa_nyakqviewform
i find myself lost in this world without my best friend the only person i feel lifted my spiritsi have no motivation and i hate every day and i think it is about time to go
it is tough it is hard it is not fair to go through this heart ache but it is part of life and mostly everyone has to go through it
i think i made the right choice for us but he is adamant he wants to be with me forever and ever
hello there just had a thought and wanted some opinions on itit is ok if this gets ignored just needed to pour my heart out
if you ever want to vent it out pm me i would love to help if i canhey guysi am new here i am seeking for support
i have been trying to make plans with her over the past month but as i said she is completely ghosting me from messages showing clear signs that she is not interested
although i had to stop talking to my friends online they did not like him and they wanted nothing with him
i have been wanting to post on here for a while reading posts and knowing that there is people out there having experiences similar to mine has made me want to share my experience in hopes that other people might find this post and feel like the way they feel is shared by more than one person
i feel like i could but i feel like that is not how i feel i do not feel like i need to cry over her maybe its because she is still slightly leading me on and in the back of my mind i get a false sense of security from it or maybe since i am always surrounded by people i do not feel like i am alone in the sense that i have people i can go to and hangout with even though i do not yet feel ready to talk about jordan to anyone
we never argued he just gave me the silent treatment until i came to him begging for him to talk to me
hi i am writing this because i am under the illusion that in some way it will make my suicide more acceptable letting some one know why i am doing it makes me feel better this will be my 3rd attempt at this i have learned a lot from my previous attempts
and i have gone back and forth with pressuring her to get back with me we have a child he is my world
i do not want to make them sad but they will only grieve for so long all my old friends have forgotten about me they will too and their lives will be better for it
i really do not want to ruin it my anxiety has already made me getting help take an extra 2 months now that i have finally managed to push myself forward i really really really do not want to waste this opportunity
is it worth pursuing or am i just caught dreaming about what could have been sorry for any grammar issues please comment if you have any questions or ofc any remarks good or bad
i practically sent her a long ass message about missing her friendship and she did not even bother to respond so i took it as an obvious decline
maybe when i was with her she was still too youngimmature not ready for a real relationship she was only 23 the first time and only a few months out of a 3 year relationship
however every time she leaves to hang with friends or family and leaves me at home to look after everybody i feel lonely i start to have fomo can not believe i am saying that it reminds me that i really do not have anyone else to lean on my mum is a grownup and i am younger so it would be nonsense for me to tag along and she does need a break at times
then again i do not know if i have the strength for that either sooner or later i will be back in the same position
i feel like my only worth was if i devoted the rest of my life to servitude because otherwise i can not do anything productive enough to be worthy of existing
my older sibling used to tease me a lot without knowing how i felt she has a vision in her mind of how i should act behave and look as her son
you just see them and your heart starts jumping all around you getting butterflies every time you look at them damn it you even imagine them sitting on that bench waiting for you to come and make even more memories
we had been texting just small talk but we broke up last week we are all unique we are all 1 of 1
i googled it and they say its probably some sort of mental thing listed is some information that tells about me and what is going on
i asked a friend to make a group on whatsapp to add me and her so i could write her something
i apologized to her for all the bad things i did and so did she i thought i was beginning to rectify my mistakes
all my life i have lived for other people and received nothing in return when i was in need and now i will finally get to do something that will bring myself peace in the end
my previous friends did not like me and pushed me away they say i always looked sad and that is why i am not welcome with them
i do not have the childhood collection of friends nor am i surrounded by family i struggle a lot to make new friends and new connections and is really affecting me
these days i felt worst always having headaches and i am always dizzy i wanted to seek for help and wanted to be happy i also have been thinking of suicide but i am too scared to do anything
i tried to show him how special he was to me i tried to be understanding and empathetic about how difficult a time he was having
found his profile active in tons of dating sites bumble latinamericancupid where he wrote he was looking for kindness and honesty
i tried meditation no luck i try reading before bed no luck it is just had to believe that he moved on so quickly and was not phased by this at all
i have a very hard time right now in my life on this moment i am 21 years old and live in europe there are a lot of reasons why my life is hard and why i hate myself for that
i was comfortable around them i was myself i was alive if you love the wrong one so much imagine how you will love the right one
i just get so sad sometimes because this is not fair all i feel is this whole fucking shit ton of sadness while he is actually happy with someone else
i have an odd work schedule so its difficult to consistently go to any library eventsthe very few they have for adults
then i got my laptop and brought it to school and people admired it in my mind and stopped calling me poor
he made me feel and think that there is still a place for someone like me in this world he made me think there still was something there
i see people all the time who say that their so saved them or gave them a reason to live and i never understood that
life will throw you so many curve balls and it constantly will but look at yourself i am expected to be this strong perfect giant disappointed and jealous that others can just pick themselves up
and if that did not work either she would then start hitting me and challenging me physically the fucked up thing about it all is that i cared about her
calling me a loser making me feel completely worthless and how do you think this is the right way to get me to stop you could have just told me ok i am done with replying to you
i was never formally diagnosed because you can not be depressed with jesus in ur life but i saw a psychologist for it for a while so i might he technically incorrect about using the word depression but i felt very alone isolated and extremely miserable constantly and i was selfharming
but i have had a few people before that i talk to at least one person i can name that has tried to help me just by being a friend asking me what i like i have people even if it is only online even if they are a conglomerate of individuals that maybe just push the like button on things i say to assert that what i say is being said and listened
i am a little older and we did not have social media when i was a teenager i will probably not be fb friends with someone again until we are marriage official lol
i am just writing a piece about healing your broken heart with art therapy exercises and i am curious if any of you have any experiance good or bad with this form of therapy
anyway all these messages about a hamster seem a bit intense to me especially given that it died a couple of months ago now
but i am just so profoundly empty with no answers as to why or how to help it it does not go away
she then sent me a friend request which i accepted but limited my profile as i wanted some spacei would really appreciate it if you could answer my survey thanks in advance
he was my first real love and boyfriend and i took it extremely poorly went to therapy and everything i have written on here about at least 45 times prior to this
hi i am 44 and i am turning 45 next month i have been single for a really long time now that is 8 years now
sometimes it is a tv show sometimes it is a vacation or a concert just something to look forward to ya know
it was an alright valentines day when i saw her and had sex with her went horribly and now somewhat i would of liked to have a validating and intimate relationship when i was in my 20s and probably would had if i was not so shy and insecure about myself for having autism
she refuses to go to a therapist or take medications she thinks she is fine but she is notpeace and love everyone stay strong my lone wolvestoday one of my close friends from college got married
the amount of messiness that occurred is so ridiculous but he ghosted me when i was in a deeply vulnerable place i felt so inconsequential already and that just nailed it in this was in the midst of lockdown i did not have anyone around
well all we do is go to school collage work until we can not anymore then die some die because of other things yes but if they do not we just live on until be kill ourselves or we get killed it is pointless yes we have happy moments but why it is all pointless and stupid we hurt and laugh to feel things so we are born to just work that is stupid
so i call uber and go home which i have apologized for endlessly for letting my fears get the better of me that night
ps he told me that i help him be at peace with his feelings and i make him happier which makes me rly happy and so i think it is a good step
i can not bear these intrusive thoughts anymore i try to walk as an exercise now and then but it is not enough
i am stuck between both wanting to be alone out of comfort and habit and not wanting to be alone because i can see myself eventually doing what so many of my elderly relatives once did finding themselves alone and at a loss of purpose they stopped caring for themselves sat down and just faded away until it was time to bury them
has anyone ever felt this way am i just being lazy and immature how do i get out of this mess
now here i am 2 weeks later lonely heartbroken and bored without her the worse part for me is knowing that i will not feel her warmth again for who knows how long or if i will ever feel it again
i do not tell him anything bc i think he will burst at me for being week or will start the same rant where he says in my days these facilities were not there and would never think about my problem
i do not want to have suicidal thoughts and hurt myself buying her drinks food etc she said do not worry about it
also i do not think these are exactly hallucinations but i sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye but i think it is just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost
but now i am really struggling with what to do because i am torn between keeping my family safe vs
but without physical classes next semester my family prefers that i stay in the countryside for the next five or six months
i do not know how to stop believing he can and will wake up to himself one day my gut tells me he was supposed to be the one for me
and she will not be in the christian heaven waiting for me as a reward for everything i have gone through during my sorry bitchass excuse for a life because she does not exist in our cursed reality so i do not need this heaven even if it exists which means that even in the afterlife i will not be happy or even if she is there do you really think she will agree to spend the rest of the eternity with a weak and ugly old man let even the omnibenevolent weak and ugly old man
i just lost my closest friends who were the first people i truly felt like i finally had a place in the world with
i listen to music or podcasts when doing chores but sometimes having something audio only makes me feel my loneliness more
during lessons i can not focus at all it is very difficult for me to pay attention at lesson i always end up just sitting and not paying attention or getting distracted by doing other stuff
the contact we have atm is purely via instagram and whatsapp and mostly consists of just sending each other memes and funny videos
how much more likely if at all is the doctor to dimiss the patients concern without investigating it further than if the patient had no known mental health issues to what extent does this affect the quality of healthcare provided to patients with a preexisting mental health condition is it possible to estimate the amount of missed diagnoses or misdiagnoses due to such bias
he was so madly in love with me i just do not understand i am so so so sad but i still view myself as fat disgusting and unworthy
how do i kick this feeling i no longer have a say in what direction her life goes but i want the best for her and everyone around her is saying she is not on a healthy path
if i try to get help i can enjoy a permenant black mark of being mentally ill i have had ambitions to become a gun owner in the past when i still had ambitions i am a euro by the way or immigration assuming i live long enough to get the emergency access to a therapist of any kind 4 months is a great turn around time for emergencies got to love irish healthcare
i guess i am looking for advice or if anyone could tell me if they think he is going to come back or not
i am a student and i have to make this presentation in order to pass this class there a teacher listening and giving me scorei have never met her before
her strategy is if i am just going to be mean then he will stop but that is not how you get me to stop
me and my girlfriend of two years broke up about a month ago and it is been the hardest thing i have ever gone through this came at the peak of losing friends due to not seeing them irl i just feel so lonely i just want to know how to feel better within myself
now most of them are married with children and going on disney vacations instead of playing poker their wives do not want them hanging with me specifically because i have no family of my own
i love her so much that i am willing to do that but it has been really tough to not talk to someone you have grown accustomed to talking to daily for years
sad thing is i know if i take my own life it will devastate my family i am 30 next year and have nothing going for my life
but it is been 2 days now and it was only two drinksit hurts you will not know how much it breaks your soul unless it happened to you
i am too tired to even do basic things there is no way that i can accomplish everything i need to in order to get back on the right track everyone says that you should not kill yourself because there is always hope and maybe there would be if they were in my position but i did not get here by being a functioning human being
it is always hard seeing her but in the last month every time i go to work or think about seeing her i get crippling anxiety
my biggest fan hugging him to this day is still overwhelming how much i feel i never want to let go
i can not even socialize it is like i forgot how to talk now i fucking hate the house that i live in it is so fucking dirty and cockroaches everywhere
that night we started now i am pretty illiterate and i could not read until a few months agofor example all day today it is been hot and humid
i feared two things the possibility of happiness and the impact my suicide would have on othersi no longer fear i may be missing out on life the die have been cast already
and what she did instead of selling nudes she just post them for free to everyone and to this day still does
i acted a little needy during the end of the relationship which got her a little annoyed during the breakup and a the day after now she still initiated contact with me the day after the breakup and has said she still loves me so i do not think neediness totally killed it either way i had to go on no contact today is day 10
that said well people get married have relationships have kids or have their own problems they have less time less energy and less inclinationand they are less able to be really around when i need them the thing about mental illness and loneliness they tend to be pretty constant and they are not very easy to plan around lol
people keep leaving i have lost numerous ppl in the last few monthsin fact on the last call he blamed me for things that i never did or said
just do not know what to do anymore an feel like such a failure knowing she does not love me anymore hurts an feel like nothing i can do will change it
i need other people to survive and no matter how jaded or cynical or misanthropic i become i still realize this
i am too lazy to actually formulate a well thought or response about this but i genuinely have no reason to live
after our second break up we did not talk for like 2 weeks and then i was starting to move on and things became easier i could sleep without thinking of her and my life was getting back on track
i would go back to school but i would not be able to go to the classes because the ones i would attend are primarily in the middle of the day and i have to work full time
he told me he still has feelings for me i feel like he is the one for me but i am seriously running out of any real defense
i also feel so sad that my husband will have to watch me die it is indescribable what effect this disease has had on me mentally and physically
it was great but after it was over i felt really guilty it can not be that you have to make yourself emotionally dependable on others i refuse to believe that
fast foward to octuber i tried to fix things so we could be together again i was blind because of love did not work she again said horrible things to me and just left me
so i have a friend who is been battling with mental health issues for so long we have constantly tried to get help and i have called multiple helplines for her
that was my first time ever and i do not awful because i was so anxious my heart was broken into tiny pieces after she did that
i know mates rip into each other but this has been going on for years and it is every time we talk
you decide then to go out see your friends have funyou get dressed you get out of the house and go see your friends
i do not know if i will ever be in love again i do not mean to be dramatic i just do not know how i could trust anyone as innocently as i did with her
i can not hate her and although that deep depression and unrelenting anxiety has subsided to a very manageable dullness it still breaks my heart that i lost her that we are not together that she did not feel the way for me that she made it seem she did the way that i felt about her and now even worse the way it seems she feels about her boyfriend
i know me and i know i can not knowingly ruin her life anymore or the life of a por woman just looking for love
mentality loneliness where the individual feels that they are alone in their values and beliefs making it seem as if the whole world is against them
this year has been terrible and i attempted suicide for the first time but stopped 2 seconds before it would have been irreversible
and it is time to take your own advice instead of just thinking about it show that you are more than this breakup
because of that he believed i was over reacting by not supporting his behaviour but the feeling makes it clear that i am straight
i started to get really obsessed and i feel like it is only become worseuntil the age of maybe between 1418 i started to become a dumb person logic is not my friend
i am so fucking hurt how you just felt more fear than anything that is how much power they have over you and that is how cowardly you are
and finally i was comfortable with him i was completely into him whenever i was depressed or sad i would masturbate
i can only hope i can make it out if this hell i have been living in which is pennsylvania for me and into something hopefully better before i die or go mental which is about the best you can expect being from central pa
i know i should work on myself but its hard when i have no one to help me through the process
i am a good person i have all the love in the world to share just no one to share it with its just something i will have to get used too i guess
but you see i was so confuse but i really ask her to rethink and she said she will try to do it and she did say she was very tired but she think about this for few weeks now
i felt like i was getting happier while he was not when we met we were both lost confused and without a solid path
right now i do not know what i am doing not just in general of course with everyday life but specifically right now as i am writing whatever the hell this is or is going to be i heard that writing about what you are feeling what you are thoughts are and what you are experiencing helps to cope with those very same feelings
anyways with that i will be leaving this group you all were so much help and i wish the best for you all because that is what you deserve i will get off my soap box now but really you will be okay
it sucks and all i can think about is getting on a dating app and talking to new people i do not think i want to die i do not want to hurt myself i think the unknown scares me
he became offended when she sent him a photo of her unborn baby who had the mouth open on the scan he thought it was a reference to his big mouth
they do not even care that i am still here when i could have been dead last month they take me for granted and it hurts so fucking much i feel so betrayed and backstabbed
to just sleep and hope that my dream would take away all the pain that i am feeling i wish that i could just live in my dreams
why do i have these thoughts side note i have never been diagnosed with any mental health problems would never think about suicide either
or sometimes i am swimming in the depths and find where its going to the shore i follow the voice and i try to swim to the top but when i get there there is ice
i still think way too much about you about the wonderful trips we took and the fact that i still cannot imagine a future with anyone but you
they told me no one would love me except them and that i was lucky to have them as my parents
i just want to run away and cry and scream till i can not anymore like i am just wasting my time existing
i do not fucking want to he is also been sneaking this person in at night which makes me super uncomfortable on so many levels
i asked him about the girl from the festival lisa but he told me that they were friends little did i know
i am not a pervert or anything like that i am not looking for a wank partner i just need to talk but i like talking to girls more sorry boys
my mother came i my room and said why do not you and your father have dinner together why do not you speak much now he thinks that i am only here for his money and you do not need him
and now i worry so much to the point where i sleep all day and night so i do not have to worry
they said the presence of those you enjoy sparks joy rather than the activities or conversation sometimes it is enjoyable to simply be together even if activities are separate or conversation lulls
i can not blame her she calmed herself and asked me to talk to her when i get such thoughts or urges again
and now i am starting to think why am i writing this the reason is that i am too lazy to solve my problems and i do not have it in me to just end all my problems so i just blabber into the endless abyss of the internet
all he do is playing with his friends online and honestly i am people person it is so hard to be by myself in nowhere where the only conversation i have is when me and my bf go to cook and eat
but i have also seen several immature tendencies since he has less relationship experience like canceling plans showboating his past sexual experiences whether it be nights at bars dates hanging with strippers or just the general mention of how cute someone is when it is completely irrelevant to the story
three words if you had to pick three words to describe you what would you pick i sure know what i would pick lonely ugly loser
i messaged again and asked if it was abuse because if i could oversee being an abuser god knows what is wrong with me
standard it is not your fault someone broke into your car compassion goes here but that does not really change the imprint that experience left on my mind
ever since i was 15 i started dealing with depression and the only thing that ever helped was being in a relationship
i hate cops and do not want to deal with them while i am suicidal not to mention i could get placed under some sort of inpatient care program if i am deemed a danger to myself or others which i probably can
both are important to me and my mental health but choosing the one that mostly benefits me makes me feel bad and choosing the one that does not benefit me as much makes me feel bad ugh i am a horrible person can anyone tell me how i can make myself feel better about these kind of decisions
we hung out basically the next 5 days following our first date talked all the time and just really got each other in the goofiest loveliest ways
bout seriously i just think that these things only makes you feel worst in the end she cuts me because i did not give her space and time that she needed
i just do not get it i hate being alone my spouse left me the other day because of my mental health and it would be nice to have a buddy to just shoot the shit with
at first i said okay we can but he need to be like 100 sure of his decision and now i feel strange
i would like some advice how to get out of this since i really have to fix stuff in my life right now college and work and i can not start seeing someone new for the foreseeable future
i was watching a show that went deep into the issues of those on the autism spectrum my younger brother has severe autism and can barely speak at the age of 11
it is been 3 months with no contact and i still have dreams of her if only i could find a therapist who would not see the masshealth bit and just help
when i try to say certain words i feel such an intense feeling of shame that i just physically can not get them out of my mouth
i am trying everything i can and it is not working it is affecting me aswell i am feel so tired and depressed all the time and making me suicidal as well
some ppl are their for shorter than others and they teach you a lesson maybe it is showing you that they were not good friends or showing you that you were the bad friend
i am unsure if this is the right sub to post this in but i will do it anyways15f i have been diagnosed with anxiety depression ocd and add
they also suggested i can just text them the ice cube emoji anytime and they will bring me one so i do not have to explain how adorable this is honestly a game changer
i am having trouble finishing this cuz my head just goes completely blank and i can not remember what i was going to say
if anyone has experienced something similar to this what happened and can you give me adviceshow solidarity with me if you ever see this b listen to godspeed by frank ocean
but then i am reminded that i am so mentally unhealthy to the point i can not take care of myself and i think do i really want to do that to someone
i have had ocd all life and pocd the last yeargroinal response makes me not being able to be with my littlebrother how do i recover
the only way i can think to escape this hell is to kms and right now that sounds pretty good i will finally be at peace i will be with my mom i will be rid of this awful disease fuck
i wanted her to tell me one last time that there was no chance for us if this was the case she need to leave me alone and let me go
i feel like every time i think one good thing could happen to me i get another slap in the face and i wish for once i could feel like i deserved to be alive
probably could ease the situation but then again who really knows the wiser ones always emphasize on building a relationship with the self
i am pissed that i can not give my love to someone which is all i really want idgaf about sex honestly i just want someone to share life with and cuddle and talk with
and she just said and look where that is gotten me i know she is been a little depressed lately but i thought we were working on it together
but sometimes i do not really know do i really care am i really sad or do i just force myself to feel something or maybe i just do not know how to greef at this point i really do not understand my emotions
but maybe i went in too strong we had a conversation about love languages and he said his was gift giving n stuff
maybe it is a bit pathetic but i wish such a person could just appear in my life that would make me feel something besides emptiness again
she gave me an example i forgot how i even made it to work this morning or i forgot how i even took that exit to work this morning that is a form of dissociation
all i wish for is his happiness i forgot about myself and my needs the day i met him i want to take care of him and his needs and wants
it is like this everyday now i just wait to hear what i did wrong we make a mistake this is a really big confidence lesson
that kid in 8th grade is me and each year that led up to my 8th grade year i have gotten 2 times worse
i just started reading kafka on the shore by haruki murakami and i came across this part that really resonated with me
i asked him what he was doing for his birthday he throwing a freaking party with his friends he said he does not care about covid19
it is been a year since i have mooved away from my family and hometown to try and live by myself it is been a year that i went away from the town where i broke up with my first true gf and the place my then best friend raped his girlfriend to try and start anew
i wish we never in a relationship so i never hurt you like this i want to be selfish and run away from the pain
i am pissed that i am still living in this shit hole i am pissed that despite my best efforts i can not connect with anyone
how long can i keep living just because other people want me aroundi really do not give a fuck about what they want
i was worried about some of the nuances in him but i loved him so much that i closed my eyes
all of this going down within the span of five hours i am too hurt to cry i need some helpsorry in advance this is going to be a long rant
mostly this would not bother me because this has happened a couple of times now but this time basically nothing is working
like everything with this boy is over and i have no way to fix things that never needed fixing he texted me and said really self deprecating stuff such as i am the worst trash on earth
i talked to my friend about this they have been studying mental health for a few years now to which they said it was not normal and it could be schizophrenia although i do not believe them
at the same time i started talking with a friend of mine with whom i went to bed two years ago
my close family member has cancer they are fighting it and have gone through a ton already and right now they are living their life
when we fill the cup with water most of the time the water is not so pure dirt bacteria rocks and many undesirable things can be in the water making it cloudy even when settled and clear it takes only a little bit of motion for it to become unsettled and unclear our mind is like this but this is something we can change
think about my future think about never having a good job no wife maybe i will die a virgin or never kiss a girl
i am not going to spend my life on reddit crying about my problems like all my previous posts it solves nothing i still feel the same
i do not know if he would settled and got comfortable and thought i would stay forever or he is had a change of mind or heart but it just used to fucking hurt so much when i would be in such a bad place and he would still reply coldly or not reply for hours at a time
the main point as to why i had not realized it is because i always had people to lean on now i do not really
whenever i think about what i have been through i feel myself tearing up it is this feeling of sorrow regret anger disappointment and pity that i do not think will ever leave me
i treated her like my own child and i never once abandoned her until that moment she was always super outgoing caring and she was just overall so supportive of everything
at first i thought it was my other uncle who was invited just stopping by to say merry christmas but then my mom answered the door and said that it was my uncle
the only thing keeping me from reaching out is respect for her wishes and her new family i know it is not right but i have always had difficulty letting go in my life
even though we are good no ill feelings i do not think i can call them friends though i have been working at my current job since october i have not really made friends with my coworkers either
i told him we do not feel the same anymore at another occasion i will tell him that if i did something wrong again
at first we were going to split i was still floating around not sure what i wanted to do but we both decided that we would give it a shot and i follower over a few months later
i came over every weekend and i cleaned his room for him one time it always helps me when i am sad to have a clean space
i offered countless times to fix the issue and addressed it because it was important to me we were a family
constantly needing to watch myself for signs of revealing it at work or for signs that it is somehow corroding at my values or my mind
was slowly overcoming suicidal ideation when family is hit with covid not sure if i am going to a pull through it if father passes
and for me i will just keep on writing my thoughts here wondering how happy i would have been if i was not forced and manipulated to break up with her
about léna my imaginary friend she is the same age as me she is skinnier than me and has dark hair she is much more confident and braver than me she always says what she thinks she takes care of me
i can not even think straight anymore i do not even know what is real and i feel like the world is so fucking fast
i just want to be normal to feel normal its like there is always a feeling in my gut but i do not know what it is its a pit in my stomach that you only used to feel when sad or angry or nervou but its always there
he claims to still be really affected by me and he says he loves me a lot too but he needs to stay away for sometime
i was put on wellbutrin recently for social anxiety i have had hints of depression in the past but all related or tied to my anxiety
there was one other time i do not remember when but i was going through my grandpas emails to help him clean up his inbox and i found an email titled something on the lines of dead parents are going to get it and his parents are my grandparents that i love very much
when we break up with our lover we often sink into a haze that blinds us from reality and propels us to feel worthless and lonely at this point some people find themselves desperately chasing and pursuing their ex
my exes dick stinks and had nasty white bits in his dick turns out he had a std mycoplasma and ureaplasma
during my playing time i just sent her a good bye text and leaving her all the passwords of our accounts etc
everyone is too fucking busy with their own shit yet they still get the help they need they still have lives still find love still are able to find happiness or at least be content
he has a gambling problem and it seems like every time something bad happens in his life he starts doing crazy shit like gambling excessively he promised me would stop and then leaves me on xmas eve to go gambling and gaslight me idk it feels crazy that i have been with this person for 5 years and i love him it feels like i do not matter sometimes
my life was over i had no reason to continue i still have that mentalityall has been released from my chest sorry for taking 5 or more minutes of your time
i wish so badly that i my feelings for you could be gone that i could be above it all and continue our friendship
why did he change his mind so quickly was he trying to push me away was there something going on did i do something wrong did he not feel the same strong connection i am just so extremely confused
i know now that the lack of sex was really affecting our relationship but anytime i would try and talk to her about it she would insist that it was a normal amount and that we were fine i told her that once every 3 months was not enough for me and she would just say well idk what to tell you i am still horny everyday and my gf was not fulfilling that end of the relationship for me but she was amazing everywhere else so that is why it just turned into me going into the bathroom at 11pm and jerking off to some porn just to get it out of my system
i just never could make him happy i was yelled at for apologizing and yelled at for not i was damned either way
i just want to get over them too i want to be happy again my best advice is to take everyone is advice on how to move on
through everything that has been happening the last two weeks i could talk to her she understands me but it is not romantically its emotionall suport do not get me wrong i like the little contact we have but how can i go from soulmates to friends it just really hurts
i have spent my past fearing what the future may hold fearing that i may get hurt again fearing i would never learn from my past and invite the same mistakes but you took me under your wing and supported me and showed me how much potential i had
the biggest problem for me is that it is so close to christmas and new years and i already know he and his family go me presents and i already told him i would get something as well it does not help that i have been partly quotes because he is fun to hang around yet romanticintimately it is different faking being nice but every time we kiss and such i just want to why away
due to being in pharmacy i was able to get all of pain pills that went on clearance i have 7 bottles of 650mg 24count tylenol
cutting oneself gives physical pain and therefore the body and brain responds accordingly and people are more likely to recover however if they just let their thoughts fuck their head and the just catastrophize everything they actually worsen their condition and they are less likely to recover what are your thoughts should i cut myself will it help me
i do not do change well i know it is a basic aspect of life and i can handle the usual kind of change when it is slow and hard to notice but when something is sudden it justgets to me you seei had finally gotten over most of what had happened before during the beginning of the year and i had found someone who i connected with
woke up at noon stared at the ceiling slept again woke up again and stared at the ceiling for a while once more took a thick cloth belt from the closet tied one end around the bookshelf put the loop around my neck
and they do not understand that many people would give 40 years of their lives just to have someone they can love and that loves them back they do not understand how it is to live in a void feeling separated from everyone in every sense
i just wish there was some way to get everything back to the way it was this is over two years into this every day so imagine the level of involvement
i have a diagnosis of mild depression generalised anxiety disorder and social anxiety i recieved this diagnosis when i was 17 and scared of being completely honest
arms and legs spasmed took a conscious effort to not reach for the belt i have considered it but i know i am too scared i just can not understand why i have to exist
i wish i could just sleep over this week or even month doing nothing all day drives me crazy and dark thoughts visiting more and more often
i have suffered ideation almost daily for the past 21 years i have no friends we never talked about it after that
oh and because it breaks my spirit makes me feel so fucking worthless and so on i start to neglect myself
my 27m sister 24f has always been very high anxiety and depressed however she had always been able to function on her own starting with covid in march it seems like something switched inside her brain
towards the end of it i kept hope and said this next period is good new years eve my birthday a new job i have something to look forward for but out of nowhere we get slapped with a 4th lockdown and it is 25 days long it is so hard when you fail despite doing everything right i know i have been extremely strong this year and i had not given up i feel like i tried everything and now i am at a point where idk what to do anymore i go to bed wishing not to wake up
i try to drink water it is her voice in my head asking if i am hydratedeverything around my place where she has not physically been reminds me of her and the plans we had
i understand that i should be asking this from a professional and i have tried to more than once whenever i try to talk about this the conversation just tends to drift somewhere else
sit down on the floor with your legs crossed if it hurts just grab a pillow or two and stick them right below your ass get them all nice and fluffy down there now do not overstress regarding your posture it does not have to be perfect try your best to sit upright and find the balance between having a somewhat correct but still comfortable posture
i just wanted someone to call to tell me that they love me and that its going to be okay that they will be here
lately my loneliness has been through the rooflet us post here and share some advice with everyoneall my life i have struggled to connect with people
everyday he used to add new girls on instagram and facebook only latinas until this day l still feel so sad
i do not know man i am fucked up i am doing unexpectedly great at school great at my sport that i am currently doing
i can not remember how it feels like to do cute little gestures for someone i love romantically vice versai can not remember the last time my lips locked with someone elses
i would finish a giant fucking projectparents called the cops on me said they need to take me to some hospital see ya ig
i have a severe problem with concentration i get these constant build ups of energy i just can not let out in a focused outlet
my family hss been taunting me for staying in bed all day even though i usually do due to my manic depression
after being in a relationship for a year i started to notice things he said did not add up or he would tell me something and when i would ask him
thing is this person kept pulling me in and giving me signs of wanting to reconnect whenever i told myself i am done this is enough
for a 12 year old whose hamster died yesterday i would not be surprised but for a 30 year old it seems a little concerning
edit we were in a long distance relationship but we still tried to see each other its been almost a month now sense we broke up and she stole my hoodie and said she is not giving it back she also said that she kept and still sometimes looks at our pictures but she still does not want me
i am happy it was my best friend because i would not trust anyone else with keeping them happy but at the same time
if not is there anywhere else i could go for thisi had a dream that my ex was with someone new established and everything
its been 1 whole year of depression and loneliness i want to kill myself just die cuz there no one all my dreams have already trashed by parents and every friend just left me alone
i know these fake gurus tell you dudu like become so much better that they are going to miss your presence
he would never say sorry and all i would ever get is uhh i am just a shitty boyfriend 1 month ago she messaged me and she wanted to try againand of course i accepted it
i ended up killing myself in the game and got the bad ending and i can not try again because it deletes your save file and says that some decisions do not offer a comeback
i am not being able to explain everything here but i am going through a lot please god please make it stop
i swear i have autism or something i have had my heart broken so many times in the past there is so much to unpack i am so scared of death and dying alone but i cannot live like this anymore i do not know what to do each day just gets worse
if we could fall back in love so hard only for her to drift away again after a few days apart then that is it
he does not feel the love to cope with this situation the pandemic the distance the grieving it would be so much easier for everyone i just want to be gone and forgotten
i also never had a relationship i am not a virgin anymore but that was so long ago i do feel like one
i have tried getting advice from people but they always say the same shit she did not deserve you you are young things will get better etc
it happens sometimes that she can not go to college due to her mental state and when it happens i tend to tell her it is fine and she should not worry about it
i am glad i experienced the breakup because it taught me how to be a man my brain is telling me to jump i have been taking my meds but they do not work
my cutting started up this morning when i woke up i felt like shit today i do not give a fuck if its christmas it does not feel right when i am all alone during this time of year so i said fuck it i do not want to feel how i am feeling rn so i cut two extra lines on my left wrist next to my previous self harm marks
this is my third relationship and it definitely hurts the most because i seriously thought i was going to marry her and i never would have imagined that she would do this with how perfect things seemed to be
we liked each other in middle school drifted apart i took her to homecoming my freshman year but she was not ready for a relationship
so lunch will become a normal meal dinner will be a normal meal and although i almost always skip breakfast anyway i will keep eating properly
this is more a rant than me looking for a solution because i have wanted to get this off my chest for a while
i have dealt with some things in the past i think that is what changed me i was in a bad relationship and i always felt like i had to defend myself
i am wondering if there could be something else at play here or if it is just the depression i asked my psychiatrist about adhd a year ago but she quickly dismissed it i am not looking for a diagnosis but this really sucks i can not do anything even the stuff i want to do
even just feeling like the night is winding down and like we are about to go to bed it brings me so much fear
you showed me what it means to be with a real one and you helped me overcome some of those body image issues i always struggled with
i have a question that i can not wait to ask you guys haha i am a very very impatient person and i just do not know how to cope with it
yet still i have severe anxiety i have panic attacks that can last days that leave me crawling on my hands and knees in pain
now that i am realizing how fucked up my mind is in ways i have not listed it is telling me to just buy some razors and start cutting myself again
i am very selfishly scared of not being loved again like thati am so embarrassed to say this but i have an imaginary girlfriend that keeps me company
not trying to sound full of myself just finally feelin myself again so i am putting everything i have into this my grades suck my parents think i am wasting my life
i was deeply depressed because in 20years i had never been out of work like that struggled and fought back foreclosure and suicide
no one really messages that much anyways maybe i just see it differently who knows is my ex girlfriend trying to get my attention
and usually i just deal with that a lot of days i have nothing to do but then that catches up with me and reminds me that i am wasting my life and that i am really really bored and i shut down completely and i am dying to do anything at all but nothing feels physically possible it all seems draining and unrewarding and frustrating
i just feel like i will never achieve anything and that i should just end myself is it normal to always have suicidal thoughts when you are supposed to be happy i do not feel like i can talk to anyone around me i do not want to be a burden to them they do not deserve it i am always thinking about hanging myself when looking at the ceiling
when people have the most basic material life happiness is more important than money for them if they want to earn more money and they will lose many things like family companionship the companionship of friends and the companionship of children which influence them to have a happy life
i have no idea how to heal because everytime i start healing i stop i feel irritable and feel like i mistrust everyone i also do not have many people i am close to around me
i do not have to worry about food insecurity or whether i can make my mortgage payment this month i am not being abused or threatened
the more and more i think about what happened the more and more i realize that a lot of the problems that we had were not because of me
i already feel like i am breaking his trust by making this post but i do not know what else to do because i feel that he will not really talk to anyone other than me about this
today i found out that an acquaintance of mine from my old college got a boyfriend and i also saw that people are meeting up on social media and having fun while my claim to fame has been training my cat to shake and give a high five
i am a quiet shy autistic kissless virgin guy that despises parties people here tell me to go to every party i can even though i really do not want to
honesty is simply a thing i value a lot in any kind of relationship even if the truths can be painful
flash forward we have broken it off a couple times and had a couple of fights all stemming from me not feeling like i actually exist in his life have not met his friendsmomno public instagram posts and him gaslighting to the excuse that i was too fat to be in his life
we both had anxiety and depression issues we supported each other 100 i do not believe that i know it so for context we were both aware of consequences of actions towards each other
i am constantly looking at all the windows and closets thinking somebody is there the slightest movement of a curtain and i get super freaked out
she ended by saying that when and if i ever felt ready to be friends again that i could return but not too soon she said she really enjoyed being friends but the fact that we were talking so much and that i liked her was too much
the only reason i have not tried to kill myself yet is because of how my parents would feeli can not feel anymore my emotion are so numb
it is very distasteful because he has never personally told me anything aside from i am pettychildish and that if i can talk to him in person i can talk to him over the phone dismissing my anxiety about phone calls and in the end he said he wants space and he will consider a friendship later
i remember asking why this happened to me if there really is god after that night i cut myself countless times deeper with more blood than i ever saw
all these 5 years i do not love you i cuddle you i kiss you i am with you out of habit
she opened the flood gates and made me feel safe and loved smoking drinking until the point of being blacked out just to feel something
i just have this deep burning anger for her which is useless because she does not even know i am constantly wishing the worst for her
every day i move an inch closer to killing myself and i used to tell people how i felt but now i understand that it is just a burden for people and i feel like i am worthless and useless in life
i wonder if i could ask fellow redditers for some advice one tuesday i broke up with my girlfriend the reason for the break up was because she was constantly being argumentative and was in a bad place mentally she agreed some space would be a good idea and agreed to split up
i feel sad that i will not ever have the person i love again because i have blocked him everywhere removed all his friends from my social and asked all my friends to remove him from theirs
i have been very upset with myself telling myself terrible things about myself sometimes i can control it and other times it like takes over me
it is a really hard decision but i think the right thing to do is step away and search for better healthier relationships
i could not see my only two family members i have left because of this so now i am home alone on the holidays that are the worst times for my depression in normal circumstances
i asked why he did this and he said to kill himself and told me not to call an ambulance bc of the cost and our dad would be mad
and like the titan atlas in greek mythology i feel like i too have been condemned for eternity to carry a world except for him it was the earth and for me a world of complete and utter despair
i also want that but how hard i try i can not do it not again yet she haunts my dreams i do not know what to do
it is just something that seems so me accidentally killing their family member and everyone hating them even though i could not do anything
after crying for a couple minutes i felt fine still shivering but no longer feeling that anxiousness i think that i might have just had a mild panic attack
this may sound kind of sad but i feel beyond the point of wanting to interact with people i have tried so much in real life and it never works out for me
during that time i was reexposed to pornography after not touching it since i had met my wife 6 years prior
or maybe a back rub with out sex attached or maybe him to understand that i need him to empty the dishwasher
i know it is a bad copying mechanism but idk if talking about it would even help i have not told anyone the whole story most my friends have only gotten snippets or just the basic gist
when i was a child also i used to be bullied at school mostly people ignoring me calling me things or telling me to go away
now i am back to where i was before cold and alone with no future no relationship no anything i hate my job
i know we can not officially diagnose this behavior from a reddit question but does anyone have any ideas here my first thought was schizophrenia drugs or a combination but that is just off common knowledge
but sometimes i take time to surprise her by going home etc suddenly she ask for breakup but still i act like i follow what is wrong like i want someone to notice me
i used to listen to music but it got too repetitive and it was driving me crazy started to listen to let us plays just so i could hear voices
i will not have to depend on anyone for my happiness and my relationship if it works then great otherwise i will deal with it
it was a long distance relationship btw we went to meet again in weekends and she became sick so i had to leave early
i do not have a problem talking to people i do not get anxious or anything of that matter i do not feel nervous at all i am not socially awkward i am myself when around others
i thought i could make it to 2021 but i guess i will bring some good news to 2020 and shoot myself i will not chicken out this time
i went back to being alone again maybe for 2 weeks and then again made contact with my ex this time it was different we took it slow and were supposedly only seeing each other we agreed that after 3 successful dates we would make it official again
i am starting to think this is not normal as i have bpd and usually get attached to people very quickly has anyone else been through this will i ever fall in love again
i see a dentist next weeksome lonely soul trying to make a perspective visualit all started when i graduated from primary school
but i genuinely feel like people are not even smart enough or observant enough to even understand that what i am saying is actually a rude response to what they said and it happens so fast that i do not know what i say was rude until after it passed and then i feel bad about it because i felt it but i did not mean it
is this really common it makes me feel so sad i am in so much pain now but i have been hoping that i will get over it if i commit to nc but it seems like for so many people that is not the case
i have always loved speaking with people sharing stories giving advice and i was finally ready to do that in a healthy mind set
no matter how interesting dedicated to my passions or whatever i am i will always have to make up for how bad i look in comparison with men who are just not that interested in whatever they are doing but handsome
it came out in a panic and i know it hurt her she got really distant and then i gave her the space she needed
stop trying to figure out the exact reasons why they left i do not want to do anything with you anymore ending up hating you is my freedom
i do not think i am ugly and tbh i have been told i am pretty many times i have my insecurities but this is not why i did it
some moved out of town for college the few who are here just ditch plans i am so tired and alone
people do not want to be alone are afraid of people judging them want to fit in somewhere which is why i think loneliness is growing and more and more people find themselves with a lack of friends or a lack of quality friends
i think it is only really hit me now and it makes me so angry upset anxious just i feel like my mind is in shambles unable to concentrate on anything for long without a feeling of complete gut wrenching hitting me out of the blue if the thought crosses my mind
i am not the best in my socialising skills and because i am a average quit boy it was hard for my to make any friends
messages sent to friends constantly left unanswered promises to be invited next time broken and just an all around lack of effort to try to be what a friend should be
i was quickly distanced from all of my friends and he began to periodically assault and rape me and even went as far as to roofie my drinks 45 times
the last couple of weeks i have just been thinking about how to do it i wish i could get a gun here but i can not or do not know howthough i should maybe try harderi would really pay someone in nyc to do it for me i have a decent amount of in my bank account right now i would like it to not go to waste anyways
maybe if i just accept the hopelessness of my situation then the pain will go away like i think that if i was on a island alone
none of that is wrong but arguing about that every time you see someone is not exactly the best way to solve it and neither is only addressing it from one side
i am so sad i broke up with him and he is devastated and wants me back i live in a state of constant fear and despair and i can not take more of it
i just want people like me and i just want real friends and college is the place i would meet them but i am not getting in
one day they suddenly stab you in your chest the closest to your heart take everything you ever gave them and run away ringing any bells
i started 2020 depressed but with a strong mentality i was not so chronically bored i was imaginative and found joy in small things as kids do
i am a 20 year old male i have lots of friends who i love to bits and the love me loving family average job and i am happy all the time literally smiling all day yet when i lay in bed at night i just want to talk to someone who loves me or hold them
but every single day was a mountain to climb over every day she would come over i would lie in bed all day and not do anything until she got here just so i would not get wrapped up in something and could be available to hangout with her
and told me not to call an ambulance bc of the cost and our dad would be mad i had to carry him to the living room and call the police
i have been hanging out with my mum all the time all i feel is sorrow and misery i am so stuck and tired
he wanted to dump me at the end of the year go to faroe islands and meet another girl online go to her country and live with her without working
we talk every day but mostly just send memes back and forth i tried to set up some boundaries for myself
maybe i am just blinded by my emotions and there is a real answer but i can not see anything for now and tommorow i will get out of my bed after asking myself the same questions barely eat play some games and watch the same youtube videos again and again and getting in bed because i do not have anything to do
i stopped trying to even mention that i like a girl because all i ever got was you are like a brother and you are just a friend and now i feel like i am caught in the choice of settling for whatever life throws at mewhich 98 of the time are girls i am not attracted to or just living with the fact that i will get old and die a lonely and bitter old man
edit for update wow this got a lot of comments to me its really nice to hear from you all and know that i am not alone in this thank you all for commenting with your continued stories advice and thoughts it means a lot to to know i am not the only that experiences this and hearing it from so many of you has helped me a lot
but somehow i am still not i m just got out of the most serious relationship m i have been in this past wednesday
i plan on killing my self tonight within the hour goodbyewhat are your tips for dealing with mental illness during the holidays
those who broke up and tried for a friendship did you manage to make it work is so what is it like now if not why did not it
i know i deserve better and i know i will find someone who will give me so much more and someone who will never makes me question
might help to know that she had gotten a job with her friend about a month before she left me and she always wanted me to take her places despite me not really having much money
now of course everyone grieves in their own way but let me tell you somethinga broken heart with a pure soul and honest love
she thought she could not adequately care for me and did not want the pressure since she was pregnant so i moved in with my grandmother and i was bedridden
i can not it is so hard it makes me so depressed i feel like i can not do anything i wish time will turn back to last month and you were still here
everyone loves to just say you are too young move on but i am an old soul and i would give up my best years to help him through this if it meant us coming out the other side like i believe we can
gets out of the car and begins walking to fathers house store etc while i am still getting out of the car
i wish i could say i thought of the drive as a way to say to goodbye to him that is what a healthy me would do
i am sorry i do love you i will try better i care about you so much but yet i always tell him if you love me and care like you say you do you would not let this relationship fall into pieces and treat me like this
he even moved on and is in a relationship he told me he is a better man for his new girlfriend and owes it to me
she said she does not like me waiting for her and she feels too oblidge to respond to text greetings like good morning and good nights
you may be far from it or you may be close but you will never know until you reach it do not give up
sometimes i dream we are back together or it is like we never left off or we meet up and are together once again
there is a part of me saying this is terrible and i should feel guilty but there is also part of me that likes the game of cat and mouse and the thrill
i am asking for help advice what is my next action to prevent anything do i tell my brother about this surgery he will go ballistic and to me this is enough of a reason not to tell him it just does not make sense to add more to the situation aka him destroying stuff i do not care how he feels about this decision as to me it is his own fault blunt and honest
internally i never felt like i could ever be someone is number 1 coming home to an empty house felt worse that i could not even express my concerns properly to anyone
maybe i would like a fucking home cooked meal once in a while that i did not have to make and claen up after
insecure about my body i tried to be better everyday i hit private gym before and after school ballet class and gym class in between
the only place he can really go from here is a ward or to live alone and have his brain drive him to an early grave
we may become homeless over this with how fast things are going and it being hard to come up with extra money to find a new place since with the house we did not have to factor in rent
but after he made me laugh for 3 hours straight the first time we met i found it hard to believe that he was in so much pain
his computer phone and instrument have been taken away from him in his words i can not explain the feeling they are restricting everything that makes me me my music my phone my personality my friend has contemplated suicide because of all of this
i just wanted to say thank you to all the people who comment and support everyone on here i really struggled this year and i do not think i would still be here without the people here pushing me to keep going i am not fixed or free from suicidal thoughts but i am much better than i was and i found some support that works for me
got the strength to talk about my problem to face what i was doing wrong what i stopped doing become the darkness and who i was affecting the people who loves me and around me
it can take years and i do not want to feel this way for years then in the last month and a half of our friendship she was different
everything feels like it is just all wrong no matter how much i intended for things to go well i just had too many personal blind spots to navigate them
there was so many red flags in the beginning but i ignored them because i felt alone and he was there
my life had finally come together we moved back to help tend to my ailing father stage four cancer it was in remission or supressed whatever they do to keep it undercontrol
anyway with all of this he still wants to be friends but i want to move on not talk to him ever again not reach out for closure not see what he is up to not wish him happy birthday does that make me a bad person
i did not want to do anything whatever i picked up nothing would bring me joy any kind of good or at least occupation
me and my husband broke up after a 3 year relationship because he cheated and blamed everything on me it is only been a month and i am pretty much over things and all my feelings are gone
just feel like i have hit a wall my bipolar and anxiety makes it so i can not work more than 3 months at a time before i crash
i have not felt suicidal in months but suddenly all i want to do is down a bottle of tylenol nothing even triggered this i think i am just overwhelmed i work a lot and i do not have any friends i can hang out with i live in another state and the friends i do have do not want to talk to me about my mental health which i totally understand but fuck
or some others talked to me a bit but quickly friendzoned me in like a week and then stopped the communication althogeter
i started drinking daily to combat my need for clonazepami am tired of trying and expecting to be ok even in the end of the day nothing will change
that everything that was wrong with me was me and that would not have happened if it was not my fault almost two months ago i met this guy and we hit it off
i made this video after my own journey through many breakups and i pray it touches some of you it is 27 minutes but i promise you will get something out of it i share my tips on how to heal in a healthy way
anyone have any idea why i should go on or any ideas on how to change this messi just want to be kissed once before i die
also another thing i hate is i can not stop binge eating i have been struggling with this for three years i hate it because i used to be skinny but i thought i was fat but now i am actually fat i can not stop no matter how hard i try to i just hate it so much i want to get out it but it is driving me mad
i am only 16 and i do not have my license or a job so i can not pick up more financial things to take to some strain off of my dad
i will try to keep this short but i have this ex girlfriend who did some seriously messed up things to me and it really damaged me
he did not say those things just to provoke me maybe i was just doing something wrong maybe i was going about this all in the wrong way
you think of them whenever you see something beautiful or touching whenever you hear an emotional song or read a romantic novel they are the first thing that pops into your head right
do i just let those i am worried about live their lives and let us situations roll until the end and just be there for them in the end i do not know how to deal with my severe fucking anxiety
i am so depressed i have been just surviving for a while it is almost christmas and i do not know how to fake it for my son and husband what do i do
i said what did i do to deserve this but i find myself slipping back into depression every day and its fucking terrifying
also i was not diagnosed with anxiety or anything like that i am not one to worry about things i am always chill and struggle with having any intense emotion but this is stressful
i wake up after sleeping just a few hours fully rested and in the mornings i pace and practically bounce off the walls
i need to know if you guys can explain to me if the medication is the problem this has actually happened on more than one occasion to me
i overthink a lot to the point where i rarely sleep because my thoughts do not let me to i feel constant detachment from reality
for example i saw a video of how to put a face shield and when i tried i messed it up
i know that may seem strange to neurotipicals but you have to understand i have been diagnozed with ocd which means that if an upseting idea gets in my head it never goes away never unfortunately i got the worst fucking idea get in my head that i am the only mind that exists and other living things do not have an inner experience like me
give me my shit now and he did without opening the door completely because he is a fucking chicken shit sissy boy with literally no backbone of a real man to face the true fury of a real woman i have made up my mind
which leads to now she still checks up on me and we have rekindled something recently in the past two weeks but i am still afraid of her
i do not want to go into too much detail as this post would take forever if i want to really go into everything he is done
but i am and i do not think that is going to change to much i just want it to change a little bit in order for me to deal with it
i just do not know where to go from here or what to think i made all the effort i offered ideas and solutions to reconnecting
sorry if it seems like i am rambling i just really feel lonely and i feel like wherever i go i will end up feeling lonely and it just scares me
my brain basically felt like in split in pieces and took 3 years to piece together again i was only a 25 year old woman
why did i have to play it it brought out existential feelings i have not thought about in a whileso through middle and high school and late teens i had plenty of friends i was never mr
i am so fucking bored and i have been bored for as long as i can remember and it is unbearable and i do not know what to do to change that i am not managing to accurately express what is going on in my head there is no point in anything literally speaking and i can not end things because i know people care about me i am just drained and empty and clueless
i ended us because i saw you were unhappy and needed growth that you could not accomplish with me i gave you all of me i could offer and it just was not enough
i quickly opened up the message log and i read her last message i am really sorry but i can not have sex with you today kyle came with me to do laundry and is in the way i think he suspects something
but i think i have become a little paranoid and would check his messages or posts if something was off i find myself looking for signs but i just know this is not healthy
it was something that needed to be done we were both struggling in life and not happy and looking to each other for happiness
i can not sleep i can not eat it takes tremendous mental effort to even get out of bed i have become hopeless and delusional as well
anyways after only a week i regret this decision mainly bc i know that we are both adults that are able to work on ourselves while still in a relationship we are both so in love and i love everything about our relationship
after 6 years of having her she died last october due to kidney cancer they opened her up and had tumors on top of tumors that killed her faster
i am in a loving relationship rent a nice apartment and am studying a masters degree my family are supportive and i am generally a happy person
my mom starts getting frustrated from ryzi constantly claiming she is cutting too much hair off at some point she starts slamming the hair cutting machine into head
she had her ambition to move abroad and i had the same as well so it all seemed to come together
not sure if this is the right place to post this in but i do not know where else to go if there is a better thread for me to post to please let me know
i have been trying to do nice things for people more often i feel like a good person doing these nice things
he said that he was not and that it was just how things had to be you do not need me and you never did so again please do not kill youself
until this day i am still in love with her but i feel like i need to go see her and just feel like i need closure
it kills me when i am always the one who care for others and literally no one gives a damn about me
i came to the realization that even if we love each other so so much right now i have issues that i need to figure out and so does he and we are only hurting each other and making things worse at this point
i know it is emo hours but i wish i could tell you that i would wait for you to figure your shit out
after every interaction my brain would pinpoint all the things i did wrong and it just felt easier to hide than to deal with those failures
about having to fend for myself in an oversaturated job market about how old my mom looks and how better her life could be if she did not have me
i have a few friends that i would classify more as just acquaintances who i talk to sometimes on groups but neither of them ever asks me specifically how i am if i want to meet or anything like that
i just always assumed it was okay and this was normal because he never really made a lot of friends and when he did he gets extra close to them super fast
i am a college student in the us i do not really have anyone to vent to and tonight is the first night i have felt suicidal and i just need some cheering up to get me out of this hole
it is 2020 how are emergency service operators especially the police still shitty at talking to people over the phone why did they have to ask me 3 fucking times if i was sure i recieved a suicide note and you want me to read verbatim a 3 page document i am telling them my sense of time is fucked right now i have been dissociating pretty badly as of late i am struggling to focus as is i am not doing good but i am picking up on the context clues
not that i really care about their opinion but it is disheartening asf that no matter how much i tell people that my life is falling apart and tell them why
it feels like everyone else has this inherent appreciation for those in their family which for some reason i just do not have
the year we spent broken up i saw what was out there i realised how rare this mans heart is and we never stopped checking in on each other
i started 2020 depressed but with a strong mentality i do not know who that person was or where he went but god damn it i want him back
i feel unseen but it is not their fault because how are they supposed to know nobody notices because i present really well and i keep it together even when i am just barely keeping it together
my eyes had completely rolled back and i was unconscious for a while i honestly do not know how i made it home
i just wanted to know what is your reason maybe we find out a common problem and also a solution for it
hey i am part of a team running a mental health discord server centered around 1on1 active listening sessions between members and listeners
social media can drive you crazy when you have broken up i am a little older and we did not have social media when i was a teenager
this feeling in my head has been part of my life 247 since middle school so it is become an automatic response to everything i have done in the past and any new thing i will do in the future
it is lovely having her as a friend and we are very close but it is a bit sad i go there almost every day because i have no friends to go to
i am at a loss for words right now i thought i could trust her i thought she actually loved me we are planned to catch up in the next day or two how do i bring it up do i just confront her head on do i hint at it please help
we talked after that and it seemed like it was just her way of living she did not saw it as something so horrible as i did
all of those things every single one of those things they are like clothes if you put on clothes and you do not like the way you look in the you change them
i am so lonely it is ridiculous at this point today i talked with my coworker for a bit and then we fought and it still feels like one of the most meaningful chats i had this month like i just do not have people to talk to i do not have a single person i can just send a text to
last few months of my web dev job i did force myself with drive discipline and willpower to give it my absolute all and restore my job performance and get the job back on track then i could decide the next steps that seemed like a reasonable course of action
she is smitten by someone who is just using her for sex but convinced her that they were going to start a family together
i can not seem to tell if what i said is rude or offensive therefore everyone thinks i am a rude person
he said he did not want to work his whole life and that is why he did it he wants to fix our fathers mess and after that he probably wants to commit suicide
the problem is he is acting in a way thag does not say exes or housemates he is cooking me dinner making an effort confused why i do not want to watch tv with him in the same room ie we used to do the usual binge watching a new series together he started one today and got miffed when i did not want to settle in to binge with him
they all stand looking at me in fear hands or their mouths like i am answering a death call i know it does not make sense but i am scared of who i will be
december is the month that my mom passed away so i am already in a heightened emotional state couple that with some unfortunate job problems that have affected my ability to adequately take care of myself and my bills i have fallen into a bit of a depression
i felt it in a million sharp stabs to my chest cavity as she reached for the block button and killed me off with a single click
or i simply hide it by telling myself i had been raised the way i am a lonely life she never did
my cat died horribly right in front of my eyes we lost almost all of our relatives to some nasty fight
they had been lashing out at me for months over constant texts over phone calls and in person due to their high anxiety
and while saying this you mourn even more and scream your body starts reacting more and you shake from your toes up your head you shake so hard that your head veins pop up you feel like there is a heater on you that is called a panic attack
i need to be drunk or asleep i need to be numb and distractedtbh the last part of the text insulting my apparent lack of independence etc
so my options are to live a life that makes me want to die or to risk taking away my ability to do anything about it and increasing my overall suffering with no benefit
i guess what i am getting at is that i can not help but wonder if he will come back i drank severely in early 20 s i stopped when i met this woman
me being angry took the piss covered dog blanket outside and stick it in her car i came back in and told her its all good now her car can smell like piss not the apartment wash it at your leisure
in saying that i do feel empathy but it is kind of inconsistent sometimes i do not like people being sad and sometimes i just feel nothing which is a very strange and contradicting feeling
and my very small support system are all asleep and i can not make contact just to think about it feels gross but at the same time death feels so inviting
i felt reallly bad about receiving christmas gifts long story not the point of this post but i was in a baaddd headspace and sent someone like 4 pages of text just had my whole life story in those and at the very last message i said out loud something i have never rly said before and it was almost on accident i accidentally figured out when looking at it all laid out on a screen
i feel so empty inside like i have no reason to live no i am not homeless nor lost my job this year due to covid
i am happy that i am finally coming to terms with this story and many others now but my god is it painful to realise that hole i have dug for myself so many times if i would been better if i would known myself more if i were more positive but i stole a wonderful future from both of us and that is deeply painful to deal with
but that relationship is now my new standard and i am sure that is not even healthy we had almost everything in common with just enough difference to keep things interesting
i have been stressed the last couple of weeks because it is impossible to get part time work atm i left full time work in september to go to college and have not been able to secure work since or get any money from the government and i have two big car payments this month on top of christmas gifts
i regret not noticing ever secret i love yous we sharedjust here thinking of all the possible ways i could die
i hate the way i view things now i have become such a cynical person and i can not even explain how badly i hate that
i have made it through this whole pandemic so far without once video chatting with friends or family and i feel like such an odd man out i have always wanted to just so i could see the people i care about but they never have the time i have not seen most of my friends or family for almost a year now and it just feels weird
at the moment i am looking into scholarships to get the hell out of here and improve my quality of life but getting one is like winning the lottery
at least i know that i have and now i can finally choose myselfhow do i continue living when it feels like i do not deserve it i just want her back
the guilt for the sister situation was strong at the time it was just me and my dad already we had a guinea pig
sometimes those help me a lot with my anxiety and my thoughtswhen you on facebook have 1000 friends but in real life 0
something that would show remorse for how she left me or display some form of respect or adoration for what we shared
my mind keeps bouncing between that and the what ifs what if we get back together i have everything i could ever want except love and companionship
first time he ended things second time i ended things because he was not being honest about his feelings and was scared to be in love
it is not that i would ever do something like that but just the fact that i have a lot of characteristics with these lowest of the low scares me
a trusting loving kind yet passionate partner who supports me and let us me love him bc god knows i have so much love to give
thank god she has a good guy who takes good care of her though he belongs to another caste and my dads been putting our whole family through hell to convince my sister to marry some guy from our caste
i finally told him it was just anxiety and to forget about it it is not like i starve myself or fantasize about suicide
meanwhile i will try to save money so that i can make a trip to meet her it is going to take long to save enough but i will do it i am a broke guy but got a job which pays i walk everyday to work and skip 2 meals only having dinner to save money i hope i fulfill at least this one wish
she already lied she already got caught trying to use me and then dump me at the end of the year
i do not hold the baby like she does so i hold it wrong an now she does not let me hold my kid i do not feed him like she does now i can not feed him
i am only 15 but i can not see myself living much longer knowing that i could have been the reason that someone got hurt or died
what about me and how unhappy i have been for years why do not i get to choose my own fate like the rest of us it is not fair in fact i think suicide is not selfish forcing someone to stay is
i was so shocked that i was speechless for the rest of the day and shortly after i started my therapy the therapist told me that his behavior looks like a narcissistic psychopath and that i am the victim of emotional abuse i am not sure what the hell was this and i feel so broken on top of that i miss him so much
i have been to all manner of psychiatrists psychologists and therapists the only resource to ever help me was therapy and that was still very mediocre most therapists made me feel like they were just checking their watches and waiting for the session to be over it is a horrible feeling knowing that you are paying someone to do that
i felt so alone i just meet people once and there we never met again i have a hard time making friends per say because no one can actually relate to you
i fear i will never approach someone normally thinking that once again my sexuality and my body will somehow gross them out and i will get rejected wasting a lot more time
i miss all the mundane things and just having conversations it hurts so much to think that i will never experience that or have her back again
i am still struggling with depression and dpdr but i just wanted to share that i am officially 5 years sober and 8 months self harm free today it is been hard but i think i am starting to live again
i am growing more then ever as a person and in some ways it feels like i am start to find out who i am really am
as many others know i am not judgemental i give you my honest thoughts opinions and no matter what it is i help you out as much as i can
i did not choose to be in this family i just am and now i have to participate in all of these holiday events why because if i do not i will make other people sad
i tend to believe that she was sexually abused by her brother but we never talked about it and i do not think she ever talked about it with anyone else
where he was a man of faith a nondenominational christian the jokes on me my parents do not really take mental illnesses seriously
i still live at home i still self harm and i suffer with bdd and issues like that i feel very
i keep trying to be okay i am in college i had to take some semesters off because i attempted suicide twice
it is been over six months and no matter what i do i can not get her out of my dreams she is always in them
thing is i feel like it is much easier to connect with anglophones as i have been living here for like damn near 10 yrs but i still never had a fufilling social life
i hold her while i am working i am a developer i work at home i take her near me when i am cooking and i like to cuddle her while i am relaxing
love is not always butterflies it takes choosing the person over any hardships and learning to love the person through their harder times
but i would talk to these girls online because mostly i got anxious when talking to girls and i would get really quiet because i would not know what to say and i felt that talking over textsnap is way easier
as title suggests i am having a terrible day emotionally i hate my life and the world today however the in the past two years he is been really annoying
i started feeling depressed angry i would hit things my knuckles are scar tissue to this day what did i do in my life i ask myself that too
i also can not remember sounds smells or feelings some examples of this would be that i can not think of what my mother looks like
yes my fiancé gf cheated on me with a god damn pedophile which they gave they said they were really happy for us
why has the narcissistic ex crossed the road they thought it was a boundary i am sure many have had better results
i have bpd and depression and i am currently trying to get away from abusive family i am not really friends with anyone at university and my boyfriend is the only close person there
his friends told me about it because they are my friends to and the day we should go back together he decided to officially dump me
i regret making online friends because they have impacted me negatively and i can not just delete everything and disappear because i want to be considerate of their feelings
i do not know how to forget forgive move on this hatred has ruined me as a person and has ruined my life
after a couple of months i realised that i was falling in love with said boss sure that hurt because he was engaged so i knew nothing could ever happen but i was still happy because he was my best friend
as the title states i have a desire to hurt everyone around me i have been told by my therapist that i have issues feeling certain emotions like remorse empathy etc
then again i met with someone recently not a date who also talked about her exboyfriend in a really affectionate manner hearing that took me to the same place that pit of darkness every time anyone talks of intimacy i fall into that pit
now why is this that does not make sense it is called familiar pain i thought that what was missing in my life was other people
try new things talk with people share who you are and just be you it all comes together as it should
i talked to other girls and flirted with them i never physically cheated but if we are all honest emotionally cheating is still cheating
i can not concentrate and i feel this overthinking is potentially dangerous they are all my own authentic thoughts and not intrusive thoughts
i can not help but to still love him but i know it will take time i was thinking since i am on social media a lot
had a rough year like us all close family member died jobless for months and living in another country with no friends now a 12 year relationship ended yesterday by my bf he is going through his own stuff so i can not even be angry it is all too much people are asking too much for me to smile and join in this christmas
tbh i do not even remember what i typed in these few minutes i just needed to say this if you read it thank you i guess and if not you will probably never read this either
last week was my closest one to that day 16 cuts around my body wherever i found a vein there is a cut some will fade away some will stay longer
i do not want to live a life without her by my side the thought of her being with someone else absolutely kills me
i do not know what to believe anymore he told me he still has feelings for me for more information visit wwwmindfuluh
i was on medication for the first 3 months of the year and came off them because they made me super sick
when i was 13 i started to neglect myself eating poorly not taking care of my skin drinking too much coffee and later as i went on 16 i started to delve into my eating disorder
a year and a half of dating just gone in a day because he said he does not know if he sees a future with me anymore
in my dream every scenario we end up breakup i got dumped my ex looked me with sad face and i got dumped pack my stuff and leave
i thought i had a lot of friends but in these i have noticed that is not true i tried messaging and calling my supposed friends and none has answered not even one it appears no one cares about me for me this is a first i have not feel so lonely in my life and i have considered killing myself
but his thoughts are now entirely consuming the peace of my mind and i can not deal with the sadness insecurity self doubt hating myself and the loneliness
what a great time to be alone society is saying to stay home and not go out with others but i live alone and work from home loneliness will not be amplified
i instantly thought she was the cutest girl i had ever seen and i have not had as big of a crush on anyone in a couple years
i do not know where to start i am in so much pain and i feel so alone i have been crying for days and nights now i can not eat or sleep
copd emphysema she kept smoking and one morningshe set herself on fire while smoking with her oxygen on i recently broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years and not going to lie i expected some comforting
i think in lotto you call this a double jackpot someone to test my limitsis there anyone coz i am missing her can not even sleep
i have been in treatment for so long and before that i was depressed as a child and kept it suppressed it is been a really long time i know it gets better but in the moment i just do not know what to do
the box came with a card and the way she signed it tho was like it was written for a coworker full name and a period so pretty cold with a template write up not her style
it was never as deep for them and so you can allow yourself to recognise that they they can not break you because they never had you
my job has taken a significant turn for the worse in the last couple of months i am almost 30 and still live at home i have next to no friends and just as i thought i was getting into my first real relationship the woman decided to call it off oh and we work together so i still have to see her most days
i have made so many huge mistakes around my friends i put my faith and trust in someone who was emotionally abusive towards my online friends i blame myself because i acted on it she complained about her so called toxic girlfriend i proceeded to go on a witch hunt to tell her off
i have never felt this way about any of my five other relationships i was always able to look back on them and like some aspect of what we did together
i think we both had our faults but i know i could not walk out that door but you could my life has dramatically turned upside down
someday people are going to start caring about me and that is going to be when i am dead but no friends have ever really planned anything for my birthday like ever i can not really explain it
from the first day we met i felt you are my soulmate and you are the one i want to be with
now i am thinking about trying again since it is christmas time and it is only right to make up for the one i blew however this time i am not looking to date per se i do not know if i am quite ready for that yet just want someonepreferably a female to spend some time with and potentially become friends with and in the future hopefully girlfriend
i still loved her deep down but held it in and focused on just being her friend but i got annoying and she got mad and she blocked me on everything
of course they were not perfect as no parents are and of course i have negative memories from childhood too i was an anxious and shy child with fears of lots of different things and especially once i got to grade school i sometimes had trouble making friends and feeling included
i hope you guys get up and do something better in your life read go out with your friends staying at home crying about someone who clearly does not care about your existence is such a bad idea
i find it hard to breathe wherever i go to the kitchen the living room my siblings room anywhere i want to leave
it started to feel like a tryout as oppose to a loving or fun thing i thought i was slowly starting to get better with the limited attempts
i have made it an effort to now take the initiative when to hang out with him and have more so recently as my sister has been over his negative and weird texts also he has never sent mean things to me and i feel like i have been the only one keeping real contact with him
hey all so girlfriend of 10 years and i broke up in june so like 6ish months ago went through the process of grieving and stuff but i find myself still hurting and wanting to be back with her but at the same time finding bullshit reasons to hate her lol i am so lost and so confused
when peeps only text you when they feel lonely then after that they pretend you do not exist last night i dreamed we were back in class were we first meet
i do not have many people to call and the few i do never answer or the conversations just leave me feeling empty
when i was younger i developed a me against the world type of mindset and felt weak when i could not handle my problems on my own
i just wish i was not so spoiled so i could actually do it and not feel guilty that my family spent all thjis money to go to waste
i am good at making new friends and talking to people but somehow it never feels real enough because they do not know what i am really like
i woke up today at around 12 pm with a messed up sleeping schedule it is been goin on for about a month now
due to these factors i never really thought i could be depressed i have friends who have been diagnosed with depression who exhibit serious symptoms such as self harm or who have had obvious risk factors such as abusive childhoods they obviously have it bad so what i have can not be anyhting in comparison
what are some of your ways of coping or something you do to make yourself feel better during a breakdown or hard times
i told her everything the porn the weed the other girls and how i was stopping all the bullshit for her
now i do not have much of a stockpile of pills anymore at least not anything useful so now i am scared to death he will get it or give it to his family
i do not want to go back to him he does not deserve me i really love my apartment and financially think it is best to be here emotionally i think i will be ok because i have been frienddating and see there is so much more for me out there
one day i just hope to die in my sleep or just pull the trigger and jump of a high building
i know this is a hard time in everyone is life but not responding to someone for 2 months just does not feel right
i had not really felt like that about someone in so long so i gave him a chance bc i seemed to think he was mature
i mean yeah if i am horribly affected or suicidal or whatever i am sure they would drop everything to helpbut i know i am not in any danger
he told he did not want a relationship but he is already talking to a new girl i fucking hate the holidays i hate the presents food family and all the other shit
everyone else has left me and even though i still have some family that love me it just is not the same
i have been recovering from anorexia and bulimia for a while now and i think i am doing okay but i always find myself worrying about whether i am eating too little or too much after what happened with the eating disorder i just do not remember what the normal standard would be for a meal
i am leaning more towards not but i just want him to remember all the good times we had and miss me
i pray to him to heal me and when we are ready both of us to be back in a relationship
i am scared help i am a sadantisocialoverthinkerinsecureworryingmadhateful jealous and tiredsleepy sack of shit funny thing is i am only a freshman in high school
i am scared that if there will be a day that i no longer have control of myself and eventually do something that can harm me i am scared of this that i stay awake at night so sleep is hard
he says he does not have this deeper connection and it is not right to carry on but he feels the same about everything in his life and generally empty
it is not that i want to be alone or something but i just can not talk to people welli had not talked to my ex in 6 months now
then i realized that when i shared my room with my brother i always had someone to talk to while i played videogames and i never realized that was a big part of the fun
everything is a chore even sleeping is a chore even though that is the only time i can get a break from this existence
i really do want her to be happy and for everything to work out for her but part of me wants it to blow up in her face
its so uncomfortable and unnerving and i can not believe i am actually genuinely considering suicide i used to be so pure and innocent now i am just a casual fucking dumbass lesbian who can not even pass middle school
i failed so much and i do not want to feel this way anymore please help but i do not dream about you anymore i think less about you
he still has messenger in case he changes his mind but i have already done my part and if he really decides one day he finally wants to make it work then he will have to do his part that is if i will still accept him
i talk to people all day people that like me you know but real friends do not exist and i think a relationship might be a bad idea in my situation
i have trying to make a plan where my suicide seems like an accident my last attempt was on october and i do not want to make my parents and sister go through that experience again
i do but though i thought she was past being contagious another cousin who is a nurse corrects me and says i have to act as if i have been exposed
say a month from now i do not fucking know what to do to see myself having made actual real progress instead of another giant spurt of great effort dedication planning doing action and work routine getting after it that culminates in some pleasant conversations here and there if that and nothing more and leaves me in essentially the same fucking spot that i am in now
so when i say do not think about your break up do not think about the situation you are going to think about the situation
miles davis is my all time favorite he got me into jazz but i do not want to sound stereotypical so i will say ornette coleman is my favorite
oh yeah let us place my ex next to jesus then let us put a diamond decorated crown on their head and a gold spear in their hand oh wait one thing is missing that is right it is me kissing their feet and professing my infinite love for them
in 2014 my nonbiological dad and mum split up leaving it to just me and my mum with no extended family
i have talked to my family about this before and explained how i am so this is why it hurts even more i thought they would have a better understanding of my situation and my mental health as i have struggled with confidence and anxiety for years and have been battling depression for some time now
hi i have created this group in facebook so that people feeling lonely due to circumstances may meet other people around them please share and join as it will enable many to connect with people and have an enriching social experience
we make a mistake this is a really big confidence lessoni am really lonely it is the first time i am experiencing this thing and i have to say it is crippling
but i also know i am being selfish because i had my chance i knew what our relationship was and i knew there was a chance things could change
i guess until the other night i thought i was mostly over her and what happened but slightly tortured by much less invasive thoughts but ones that were pretty normal since i have not found or wanted to find anybody else since her but i do not know it occurred to me that deep down i want to be with her again somehow
i broke up with him because he said he did not love me because he does not know what love is i told him if he figured it out let me know but i need to go because i can not give everything to someone who treats me badly due to not loving me that was three months ago i asked him a month ago if he think we would talk ago he pretty much said lmao idk
hey guys just felt like i need to rant somewhere but here i go so me27ym just brokeup with his gf25yf
i made a reddit post asking if my final exam was hard and my professor found it and now i failed my class
in those 4 years with her i lost my original group of friends and made another group of friends nothing like the first
i do not know what is wrong with me everytime i am supposed to be happy i am feeling like i want to die i just spent christmas with my family and everything was quite okay but right now i am only thinking about ending myself either that or running away from everybody
i hope everyone is okay and has a good day i am a 19yearold woman who really struggles to find meaning in life outside of my relationships
then simply let it all out do not think just crawl into the fetus position and let yourself cry wail scream punch everything around you
today i i was about to end it and i was ready to but my brain pointed out that i i do not deserve to be let out of the torture of this world and i am scared that once i hear my ex speak again i will go back to wanting to die even stronger than i feel at thee moment
disclaimer this is not a ploy for sympathy i am stating where i stand in my own thoughts need some advice please keep drama criticism to yourself
since you run back to her every 30 days or so due to the infamous and idiotic 30 day no contact rule she is just going to perceive you as someone she can have any time and that is unattractive and leads to only more rejection
well my ex opened the phone and read everything he became so angry with me so he broke up with me
i told him i had trust issues before we slept together he told me he had no issues and grew up in a happy family and life
at some point i do miss the good old days celebrating birthday with her i hope that one day i will feel a lot better than now
i did not even answer the call but he asked why they were calling i am just still in a lot of pain i do not want him to find someone else
if somebody can please tell me what to do to improve or if they are going through something similar i would really appreciate your advice
i can not speak to anyone because they think i am trash and something to discarded at least that is what my mind is screaming at me they want me to disappear so i can not annoy anyone anymore
yeah sure my christmas was awesome but one thing i can not get someone to be there to hold me close and talk to me
i just want to die now immediately i almost have these passive suicide thoughts everyday that is becoming more active by actively planning my eventual suicide
he even told his parents about me he never tells them about anything like that we were all about each other
i felt helpless knowing i was too far to do anything to help i still did not give up and almost lost my mind
i am in an endless cycle of pain and i do not have or see a future on earth so it really does not matter
i want to say that i can cope with it but i am crying on my own at midnight while typing this
for the record do not deny friends with benefits with the guy your partner accuses you of cheating with than admit that that is exactly what your now doing
i soon became sick with a breast lump and my sister kicked me out because it was too stressful for me to live with her while she was pregnant
i am feeling awful today again it is been 7 weeks literally the same amount of time we were dating i saw him over the weekend and we had a chat and i got my closure i felt absolutely fine yesterday so what the hell is going on honestly this is just me practically journaling so i am not expecting much here
i think the most shocking thing to me is knowing that is what he wants and that he is completely okay with that
i feel no positive change i feel so empty i feel so empty about feeling empty i do not know what to do anymore
but right now she wants to be free so that is what i have to give her i just do not have any reason to live
true love is when they take responsibility for their own actions rather than just throwing it at you and telling you is your fault not theirs even though it could be theirs
we still talk here and there and share memes and pictures to each other and yet i can not shake the feeling that is a bad idea
last night i dreamed we were back in class were we first meet i did not like that it makes me feel less human
i am not really using that as an excuse and there may have probably been things i could have done to impeach this from happening
goodness she played beautifully where she stopped playing and looked at me peeking through the door way then i heard her hello mom
i feel so bad and the reason is the stupidest reason ever i got out of a really toxic relationship november of 2019 and it took me months to really heal
honestly i am at a point now where i acknowledge there is something wrong with the way i function i am not in the same level as everyone else but i am teetering on the edge of deciding to just give up trying to be sociable and just shut myself off
i deleted any messaging apps we had to communicate with the each other because on whatsapp he blocked me anyways and on telegram he reads my texts and does not answer to me
i feel very sad i want to die sometimes i think it is being more and more often with time i do not enjoy life i fell in love with some girls and thinking about ir why they were not very good people or very smart they were certainly pretty and not having them breaks me
on this moment i am in college but i have no friends i am very broken but i try to push myself for my mother i can not let here down i whines that i could bring some friends sometime over so that she could see that i was truly happy but of course that is a impossible task
i m 22 just wanted to put this out here that i for one am also going through a lot in my life i have lost motivation in life to do anything but trying to take baby steps to help me feel better about myself again however another thing i can do to help me feel better about myself and also help other like me isumhelp them
i am afraid of everything all the time this fear is very hard to live with especially since it is present since i was so young
i do not necessarily mean in another relationship but i want to stop feeling my feelings sometimes i feel better but that is rare
because after being raised a christian my whole life some should say that i got to have fun at the age but it seems blah
if you want to reach out you will have to do it via email i have blocked you on my phone because you have not even attempted to visit me
i feel like a she will pretending to be human i know what i want to be but i will never have the funds or mental strength to get there
also sorry if it seems like i am mad at him i am really not kind of just letting it all out because i have been genuinely confused
i was very depressed i cried a lot and experienced my first mental breakdown which started happening a lot i was depressed for a very long time and it was not healthy
i know that i am projecting my own low selfworth onto other peopleremind yourself today things fall into places they are meant to be
there was no more suspicions no more secrets we could be completely free and open with one another this is over two years into this every day
he told me he could not mentally go through that again and i feel like a horrible person and do not know what to do
this is when we use the word brokeni wish i was the guy walking with her not her specifically not him specifically
it usually feels like i am just doing everything i do out of habit but especially in the past few weeks it is become harder to do these things
its getting really hard to stop those thoughts about how i am going to kill myself i have found myself being submissive towards it i really think i might do it this time
and this hurts worse than anything because i know i need to give him this time to work on himself and for me to do the same
i have some family and like less than a handful of friends that have shown their love and care for me
he kept shutting me down shutting me down and focussing only on when we would have sex i said i was not in any rush he could barely wait
it should bring me joy but when i try to do anything it is like my whole body is resisting it is like i am trying to move through peanut butter
he never replied i checked his tinder again where he had updated his bio to something something fighting his own demons first
i have been lonely all my life i have never understood why i have made all the effort i could made to try to join a group and i just never succeeded i just gravitate from one groupe to another and never have been a full member of a social circle if i want to go out i have to message first all the time exepted maybe two or three friends that ask me to go out
so i would not have to claim any race i envy mixed people for this reason recently i even started hoping for any kind of romantic love in my life even if it is unrequited
first they hook you in with promises of how you can get your ex back in x amount of days hell some fraudsalleged like
my distorted sense of time is making me worry about how fast days are flying by even though some of my friends say they felt the same about 2020
i suffer from social anxiety so that has made making friends a difficult thing to do for me which inevitably has led to a life of loneliness solitude has its ups and downs but when the downs come they are truly overwhelming i get so consumed by my aloneness and crave to have a social circle a friend or two to hangout with have conversations with and just basically do stuff with
he is very careful deletes all his conversations and i never ever tried to open his phone while he is sleeping in the past he connected his device to my telegram to see what i am writing to people
we clicked right away and the chemistry was crazy intense we could not go on a date without ending up having sex
i am calling friends exercising picking up new hobbies etc but the typical things to tell yourself to move on from a relationship are not really working for me
you have to move on with your life because while your over here trying so hard to heal yourself what are they doing
a couple days after we broke up she had sex with this an old fwb and then a week after the bu she started seeing this guy who is kind of a total asshole
everything feels so meaningless i want to find a job meet new people and all that stuffbut i do not have the energy for anything i do not even have the energy to clean up my room
i speak to a therapist weekly but can not bring myself to tell her how horribly i am doing but took civil in the same university as me because he could not get a seat we still talk
after the breakup life has changed so so much for me during covid it has been harder and slower it has been more alone than it could have been and difficult too i was very lost in the past few months still kind of am but nothing like before
i have been listening to your music you probably already know that though i downloaded your songs and played them when i was asleep and i am listening again now i also listened to the one you made the day we got together
the pain was too much the memories of my past were stronger than the drugs and alcohol i could not fight them anymore
now one way of doing this is through changing the way you handle and talk to yourself as you may know i am a big proponent of the idea that positive self talk can be just as destructive as it is negative variant so that is why we will try cultivating a realistic version of selftalk throughout this exercise
9 months later i still find myself waking up and hoping that today is the day something changes for the better
my mom is working to get mental health conversation on a platform and i am incredibly proud of her i would love nothing more than you guys to check it out and even contact her if you are interested in speaking of your experience with mental illness or one that is in your family
she brought this up again in september and i once again reassured her that i was committed to her and would stick by her and help her in whatever ways that i could
and even though my soul is aching i will not lie i am also relieved i had hatred and vengeance boiling in my blood and festering into my every memory
and i think my friends think less of me i am just generally not a great guy i likely strike people as a pervert and a creep
for the past week or so this weird thing has been happening to me the tiniest things i mean the smallest of the smallest have been making me burst into uncontrollable tears
i know i am not healing but it feels so good to be with him and it hurts so much not being with him if that makes sense
so i held it safe because i felt someday soon that relationship would end badly and i guess i selfishly knew that it would be my doorway back
she has been talking for the past 2 months about how she lost the will to live talked about suicide multiple times and looked about assisted suicide and where and how to get it
i want you to hold me and tell me everything is going to be alright i want to hear you say i love you to me again
you can not even recognize yourself you can not bear but looking at yourself and crying even more well maybe not even move on but just shut down
anyone move on from their ex and think back to last year and look at old photos and videos of how sad they were i just watched a video of myself screaming at the camera after my ex broke up with me and it made me really emotional because i really did think i would have to live with that pain in my chest forever i am over him now i just wanted to reflect
no one ever considers me a close friend i am constantly forgotten and now that i am feeling deep pain i feel the absence of love more than ever no one in my life cares about me
i know she told me she saw a general doctor and he prescribed her a very low dosage of zoloft but she of course is not taking that because apparently ssris are not good for you in the long run
i have taken a break from the internet for a couple weeks and have just been playing minectaft on my switch
people who becomes a part of me and then slowly fades away to nothing i remember laughing with her our relationship has grown in some ways but there is a lot of anguish there as well
and i do not know i mean i enjoy it sure but i feel like some of my friends are only friends with me up to this extent like very superficially and the last person i felt to be a genuine friend who i could always open up to i ended up foolishly falling in love with him
i will probably just throw up but i plan to keep going for a while and eventually drown myself or some shit
i am also an active blogger and am slowly but surely building up a decently sized following to be useful to people to help in the community to make something of myself eventually
three days later i woke up the feeling was peaceful when i was unconscious i actually long for it at times
third was perfect and blindsided me by leaving after two years and told me i was worthless with no explanation she is since explainedapologized for everything and we are friends too much damage there for me want anything again
i already tried to talk to people make friends the people in my dorm are nice but i will not see them much and they are only here for a few months
tried to kill myself at 9 years of agelife right and did not get any better got worse and worseehhh atleast pointi believe i do not exist and yet i help people who remind me everyday of my life that iam lonely as fck
you are being unrealistic that is way out of your league wow you are seriously crazy or just delusional after so long of hearing that i constantly go back and forth with the emotions
please let us know discreetlyhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposeto2fr2fsuicidewatch if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours we do not recommend trying to engage with them directly
i am talking about gimmicks like posting pics of yourself with other women on your social media with the hopes that your ex sees them and gets jealous
i was depressed and did not leave my bed for years and now i am overweight in physical pain and consequently can not hold a job that requires me to stand for 8 hours aka the only job i can get as someone with an 8th grade education
and as i was driving over a really tall ramp the thought of what would happen if i just lost control popped into my head
if you only knew the tears i she would for youi wish you knew how much i love you love is hell of a drug i just realized that
trying to accept or hoping that their decision to leave will do them good that by going on with life without us will make their life better and that they are happy with their choice
i changed my whole life for the guy and moved across states to be with him because he gave me an ultimatum after doing long distance for a year
not a sound around me that i could hear i saw him as a threat and it was a threat towards my angel
i used to always think i could stay so long as it means i do not hurt anyone by leaving but i can not find it in me anymore
after the second try did not succeed i kind of just sat there for a while feeling nothing it was oddly soothing feeling totally blank when usually my mind and emotions spiral incessantly in a depressive pattern
is he thinking about that at all i think i surprised him a tiny tiny part of me hopes that because of telling him everything he might change his mind
what can i do she also recently on text started making sexual references to how certain things i did etc made her go crazyyyy
having no one else to have that how was your day conversation with at the end of the dayi just miss him so much and can not get him off my mind
but the fucked up fear is that i wasted years on a person who deeply disliked me for whom i was a joke about a poor person about a queer person
i never took that much interest in someone my whole life it was all in vain part of me understands this it sucks when you know you care more than the other person
like what you are in a public place can you socialize or just listen to important information from others is it just me or anybody else
yet every night every morning my heart hurts deeply and i miss her sorely for some people time simply is not enough to heal
i do care about the people around me and i understand humans are social beings they need attention love and care from people that are close to them that is how you maintain relations
i just did not care all the pain i was feeling in my heart could bleed out through my arms and thighs
i was trying to turn him down politely i told him that if i was drunk perhaps i would have sex with somebody but not sober
had to lived in the slums when nothing but violence poverty fighting and constant reminder that you are in a shitty place
it hurt physically and took me about a year to get over that person i went absolutely bonkers borderline stalker like i had issues
please understand that we are all for wellinformed strategicallysavvy activism it is essential in the fight against stigma misinformation and discrimination and the fight for research treatment accommodation acceptance and understanding most of us one way or another are mentalhealth activists irl
then when he dropped me off at my moms i cried for a bit and then my brain automatically switched to denial
he would threaten to kill himself every time we had argumenti do not think your job is not important i know i said it but i know it is not true
i have not decided completely when because i am a coward and can not do it however i am going to build up the courage to do it
i wish i did not have to go through christmas this year i feel even more alone on that day then ever nobody will message me and even if they do they will not mean it and it will be just automatic message but nobody will actually care what i do on christmas i want to spend christmas with someone i love i know it sounds mean but i do not want to spend it with my family
i have tried to keep jobs but i either get hospitalized talked down at like a dog by my supervisors and hr and then fired or my employers do not approve of my unmanaged adhd and gi issues and i am fired
i considered checking myself into a mental hospital as i needed a break from taking care of myself i never did though
he was kind and patient throughout the ordeal and i was the one who was crying the entire time i cried because i had never had a nice break up before
i also have some modafinil pills which are the only things that help me cope with my situation but i can not take them daily and i feel whenever i take one i end up having a great day whereas if i do not my day is awful and the small lethargy afterwards only makes it worse
it is kind of sad to think that if i was gone that besides my parents two people might possibly feel obligated to care about it
i go to the gym 67 days a weekthis break up was only a week ago but i told myself that i can not let myself go
is it rude to say i am glad we are talking again but i still need a bit of space or that i am not ready to put my walls down so meet me where i am at
i have an addictive personality and i can be very judgemental at times i never was to her however i took her exactly how she was
why is it that i love spending time in my room is it because i appreciate my peace a lot or is it because of mdd
during this ignoring period one of my first suspicions was that guy and i felt really bad for thinking that and imagining things about it
the realization that i am too far away from my parents and loved ones during this pandemic for not being able to travel like i used to
but i am at the end of my rope i want out i am so tired of making excuses for him when my parents ask why he is not coming around for family events
i basically accidentally repeated myself cuz a few days ago she got back to me after not talking for a month cuz she was super busy and apologized
i was able ti get my phone back on and saw family reaching out my moms youngest sister invited me over for dinner and i told her about my being unemployed
after a long long painful breakup with my ex fiancehusbandbaby daddy he was all of the above lol i looked shly into the mirror just now this morning and i was like owww now who is that sexy blonde lil numberoh yeaits me
i feel alone in this and wish there was a way to get stronger but it is getting harder to bottle it up
yet i still still think the way i do am i a attention seeker for doing thisi am not sure what it is help me please
he was my best friend and partner and i thought about him every single day for the last 4 years i obviously have other friends but he was the only one always there for me and i am fucking scared i am never getting over him i can not foresee when it is going to be the first day that i do not think about him at all it really sounds so far away that it terrifies me
it sounds weird but i am still grateful for what cleo showed me in the bedroom everything else about this relationship was total shit though
because i know that hes hurting mentally with alot of childhood trauma all the siblings have had differing trama and to know i have contributed to this as an older brother breaks me down more than i already am
i just do not know what to do with my life all i do is annoy the hell out of anyone because of my add and my two ways of coping are gaming which my brother is always doing so i can not and drumming which just annoys the hell out of everyone even more i just do not see my reason to live or why i even should continue to
you decided to walk out of my life two times now first as a friend and now as a past lover
it is like i never really grew out of that sweet16 age at least in my headso my stepdad got me a tripod thing for my phone to shoot videos for school
thanks for letting me rant have a great day everyonei had a panic attack i just want to know if my loneliness is causing them
how you would feel if you were me i walk closer to death every day maybe it is time to retire from this hell
we talked on the phone and it was awful all i did was sob and all you did was get mad
i am sorry for all of this i do not expect anythingmy problem is that i do not hate my ex i do not think he hates me either
watch them leave your side walk across the shore and leave so far that you can not see them anymore they are out of sight they are gone
it is made me feel bitter that i have to live in this body a body that i despise and fails me
i do not feel like i deserve this help even if i asked for some of it so much is hinging on if my dad pulls through
and why would i feel lonelier with him than when i am alone i never had this issue with other friends or lovers
i was already busy and told him that it is okay but that i can not and that i am busy for the rest of the week but that i would keep him updated
i went to bed i really wish i did not i miss him terribly and l wish so much everything was like it used to be
in the time of confinement i tried to restart therapy and all of that bout seriously i just think that these things only makes you feel worst
for the first 7 months of the year she would say you know all this time together is just as friends right i knew she was actively pursuing someone else
second giving someone too much importance giving everything i can to please the other person to stay it was like i bribed them to stay they constantly expected me to do and give things the same way at all times they got upset when i could not
i am supposed to graduate from high school this year but i have not done any of my work this quarter i just can not get the motivation or desire to do this what is the point of working my ass off in school just so that i can slave away at a job for my entire life to continue living how is it worth it when life just shits on me
then i got absorbed into my gaming life in there i also had a bunch of friends and the same thing happened i fell out with them when i realised how toxic it really was i had made a new female friend and after seeing how they bullied her i did not want to be part of that group anymore
i hate how i look like i have so much acne in my face
then they fall out of love with that idea because it is too much work and if they stick around after that it is out of pity
however these past two days something happened which made those thoughts creep in strong than ever and the whispers became a wave drowning me and i find myself slowly yielding to their power
sometimes i think the best thing for him would be for me to let him go but i do not want to
we had only been together 5 months but because of small social bubbles this year we spent a lot of time alone which kind of accelerated our relationship
soon enough every night we ended up arguing about how my anxiety was making me pull back from the relationship both physically and mentally and fuck was that tiring
i fear that my goodness is just a false image i project and my real self is retchedreflecting on it three years later there are multiple changes that affected me
i right now just can not make sense of how two people can care about each other so much and want so hard to make it work
what i do not miss and i know she will find out sooner than later is the manipulative lying the gaslighting by finding some flaw to exploit the anger temper tantrums
i feel broken in every way after 5 months i am still struggling to leave bed somedays i just ask why people are becoming so minded over their own life and happiness to the point of not caring about the damage they can inflict on others
my energy levels are at an all time low and i feel like a robot who just works and then sits alone and then repeats
but if choose life thank you you are worthy and not alone we can go through this together show me you can do it too make me believe we can live another day
everything is really confusing and complicated right now i still was begging her to not do this but when we both fell silent she left
i19m writing this to try and express what is going on and to see if this is something everyone feels if so how anyone deals with it and if not if anyone has a solution because it feels like i have hit a dead end and i am just going to be stuck like this until i die sorry it is long and i have definitely used empty and bored way too much
we are not our past and we are not always our dreams but you are hope personified the amazing truth in my path
so now this strange selfpity as evolved into empathy i feel for othersjust moved to a new place for school everyone is new in my class
then a month ago today my current college coach also died of a heart attack he was the one from that team who fully supported me and i was open with
i have been dating this girl for the past 4 months and my brain has been ruining everything i have had my happy days my family is great
it was lovely but the screen had lousy viewing angles and was a little desaturated i decided to replace the screen myself taking the excellent display out of an old chromebook that had proven inadequate but undestroyed to put in this 116 inch laptop instead
what have i done to deserve this i loved with my all of my heart and he meant so much to me
i once pointed out she might have dressed a bit too skinrevealing i did not feel comfortable about other guys cheking her out it is stupid i was honestly proud of being able to call this amazing very good looking woman my girlfirend yet here i am saying stuff like this that makes her think that i see her as a who are
but it then happened at work then university which i left after one year and then community college anywhere else i have been i just happen to be the one who no one wants to talk to
i have been in bed since 2pm on christmas eve and finally up at 10pm tonight christmas daymy body is frail and my kidneys hurt the past 30 hours or so has been hell
why can not i feel in my body that she is horrible the way i feel in my body that i care for her that i miss her i know i should want to think of her or hear her name and think absolutely nothing of it
i feel like breaking up was the right thing to do in this moment i feel overall good about it we ended things as mature people and with mutual respect facing the hard facts of the real world
he needed two emergency surgeries to live and thankfully the other driver was not seriously injured on the exact same day my stepdad was put on hospice because his cancer treatments were no longer working
i have dreamt of me being ill enough to die and i felt relieved for the first time ever i feel terrible for wanting to be ill when others wish they were healthy
my childhood was not filled with bullying a kid i did not like shouted into my ear during a game of telephone once in elementary school i responded with no words just stabbed her in the stomach with a pen she went to the hospital and i was expelled that is about the extent of the bullying i have had to deal with
he kept going upstairs eventually he said he was making food so he again went upstairs been selfharming for six months attempted overdosing on pills once
before this i was terrified of men and even went as far s to label myself as lesbian but towards the end of my senior year i could not deny i liked guys too
my old friends are drifting away from me too so i just feel really lonely i am dreading going back because of this
a few days ago i was talking to an online friend and it sounded like they were planning to commit suicide
i just recently turned 30 and never even got to kiss a girl let alone be in a relationship i am also afraid of sex even though i masturbate and i see everyone as kids and i am childsih myself kind of losing hope and feeling depressed about it my whole life
we never got to meet but i felt like i already knew him of course that all changed in the last few months of our relationship
he came 3 weeks and took all his clothes he did not say where he was going and up to now l do not know where he is staying i am so heartbroken
i do not have any close friends that i would be able to see regularly you see honestly it is just so nice to see other human beings at the weekend particularly ones around my age
our friends his family jobs everything he promised he would never leave mei am not being able to explain everything here but i am going through a lot
she had this private story where she would post some things that seemed innocent like changing her bedsheets or playing with her dog but it was pretty much her bending over her bed and showing off her ass
so i am just feeling very lost and pointless and just all of that feel kind of blindsided by everythingtldr my gf of 8
i should have called more but i can not go back now she came back from school every now and then and she missed me so much
in that entire timeframe i was working the position but had not yet received the position job title or pay bump because i had failed my interview the first time around
i panicked yet again and hugged my knees to my chest starring at my hallway with wide eyes until my cat came to me and started rubbing against me calming me down
i feel like life after trying to attempt is never going to be the same my parentsfamily will never look at me the same and throw me a pity party and then get angry at me for being selfish there is no fucking escape from anything
so i really owed him something and thought that was the only thing i could do to pay him back by thanking him for everything
sadly it was not until after that that i started to come to terms to the reality of my situation these are things she said were pushing us apart
then i found out about his wife and family i am so badly broken i do not feel like i will ever recover
but here he is texting me how much he loves and misses me when i am not there yet i do love him i do miss him
we were both divorced him for over 10 years me for just 3 he had two teenage daughters and a bully of an ex wife

that specific punishment is invisible i mean it can not be seen its maybe something similar as if someone asks as a punishment to be always unlucky in his life if he breaks the promise he can not know if the punishmentcurse unlucky happened or not

at first its great it is as hot as you can stand you might get a companion in there lots of fun little by little though the hot water runs out at first you pretend not to notice but no matter what you do if you stick around long enough you are standing in cold water
but when we discussed how we would raise our children we quickly found out we both had a different idea of life and we are both not easy to convimce so we said we will figure it out later and i let it rest but she did not
but one side of me is kind of scared of admitting right now today i am feeling good it is like what you just can not feel good this soon but i do i guess my only advice is to not establish on your head how things will be with so much certainty because you just do not know keep in contact with yourself ask yourself how you are feeling and own it we can do this
he showed no signs of unhappiness prior to the breakup did not bring up any issues he had now he tells me he has fallen out of love with me and needs to end things

why am i still obsessing why am i still hurting myself with these images and scenarios even if it will become true even if the worst case scenario ever came true why am i bothering myself i am projecting all the pain and what ifs that i am literally manifesting to myself and causing myself more pain and harm
i like being alone it is such a peaceful moment however i like being alone not because for the sake of it it is because when i am with friends or my group i feel lonely lots of times when i am alone i am not lonely because there is literally nobody around me therefore i can not feel lonely i wish i were closer to my friends
but i know i am not it feels it is not allowed to talk about it but it should it should not be something to be ashamed of
the only thing she does is judging me telling me to stop contacting and so on her strategy is if i am just going to be mean then he will stop
we trained on it he taught me how to speak right and smile right so that no one would guess about how much i wanted to die
and it feels exactly how it felt right before you and i broke up and i am not going to do anything stupid and he and i are staying friends
she is so fucking childish as well like if she gets upset with me she just gives me the silent treatment rather than actually talking like a fucking adult
literally no further word i mailed her a birthday present that i had already gotten and that was that she will not be ridden with anxiety everyday wondering if i am safe

i have never had a kiss or a date etc long story short being alone so long is a real morale crusher
the ones you do not even try to remember or imagine them happening againthe ones you murdered but know they could be easily revived
this is a really long and complex story i will try to keep it as short as possible but if you want to dip i get it i would appreciate people familiar with these types of situations to continue reading and give some advice though since i am actually really done with life i have lost everything i have no one to talk to
maybe i am asexual or maybe i am truly horrified of intimacy it is not like i have no sex drive but thinking of having sex with another person always puts me off

during class sessions i used to always sit in the front most row because that was the place that was least occupied the reason why i rarely used to sit in the back rows was because wherever i used to sit people would always try to shift me to another bench and exclude me because they would be sitting in groups with their friends and then they used to ask me as to why i never used to talk which used to infuriate me like hell and even now it infuriates me
and i am not always sure i can express how deeply lonely this set up has made me feel because the pandemic limits how much we can see each other anyway i just want someone to feel like they want to be around me
i generally do not want to live anymore i broke up with my girlfriend around a month ago so no one too close to me would be effected by what was a suicide attempt this attempt failed btw i also got rid of toxic friends which may be a positive
looking at my body just reminds me of loving him and i can not stand it i have completely lost my sex drive
i went to tennessee with my brother and his fiance for his birthday looking to have a fun time and get away from my crazy roommate but when i came back things changed depression and anxiety spiked she started talking about how she has clear meth and dope

i consider myself a pretty extroverted guy especially on a daily basis at work and with friends but i often get stressed out around my family which makes me very introverted mostly due to whether or not the topics of conversation are fun or not then i often try to get away to get some rest etc

he and i first met a year ago and became really good friends of course there were sparks but none of us accepted them due to various reasons
i am 14 and have had a really bad relationship with my mom for quite a few years now it all started with me repeatedly telling her about symptoms of depression and her ignoring them
i guess i just wanted and needed to make up for my misgivings my mistakes and everything i felt that i did wrong
the other issue is this i did stupidly ask her on the second date if she had slept with anybody else since we broke up i just had to know and her response was i am not answering that because it is none of your business which leads me to presume she has
i just want to know he is not afraid to be honest with me about where he is at so i can decide if i am willing to meet him where he is at
maybe i just want someone to tell me that there is something worth living something that really worth of keeping trying and going in circles until the eternal darkness finally hits me

she told me she had faith in me and loved and cared for me little did i know it was all bullshit

two years ago i moved to london to study i split with my boyfriend and i started dating an old friend of mine who now is my man
we were only together for a few weeks but in that time we still ended up telling eachother that we loved eachother
i f24 realized that over the past year i have become too reliant on my partner m25 as a way of denying my loneliness
i learned things from her that made me happy and things that made me feel so unbelievably sad and one day i am positive i will find love again but today i am hopeless in my idea that somehow i do not deserve happiness with anyone
so in honor of myself and in an attempt of moving past the will she will not she contact me bull i am asking you for some words of encouragement maybe some tips on how you get through tough days if your birthday is today and you are going through it too give me a shout out i would love to hear from ya
sometimes i just feel really exhausted of getting better and getting worse and doing it over and over again sometimes it feels like i should not keep trying like maybe i am just not supposed to love a long or happy life
i just started a new job so it keeps me busy fairly much but i have this urge to play games or watch streams to distract myself every second i am not busy with something

we all lived together when we first got married because well my partner was too lazy to work at the time and i struggled to find a job when i moved and mental illness took over me
this year all the same but when i was leaving we were standing st the door talking and she asked me if we could not do the christmas presents anymore
all i can think about is dying the research on it has been soothing i have been calm about it too calm i should be scared hopeful sad anything i am numb all i can think about is killing myself my brain is in pieces
perhaps it was always evident that you thought and lived your life in different ways or saw the world differently but you chose to ignore it or worked hard to conceal or correct it
that was my first mistake in any case our relationship was fine though it is destructive to your heart its destructive to your soul
soo i feel very shitty and numb as if i had everything i wanted for a day just to have it all taken away from me and its not like i am talking to any other girl right now which would have definetely helped
he supported me emotionally all through grad school through the stress cries papers etc i worked full time while full time grad school
i have heard a lot of horror stories though about remaining friends with your ex and now i am conflicted i know things will not ever be the same again but i still want to end on friendly terms
meanwhile when we were not together he would get drunk and fall into a whirlpool of depression leaving me concerning and cryptic texts
it is a life having loved to then choose not to due to it being a painful journey of rejection and realising sorrowfully that maybe one might have to refocus on greater things passions work school
so earlier this year my brother overdosed and i have never felt more like a bitch because i was not there to help him with his stupid toxic piece of shit girlfriend
we were together for 8 years and lived together for 2 about 2 months ago she woke me up in the morning to dump me saying it was not working
i feel like i am always arguing with people in my family it is to the point that i leave the house when it is christmas thanksgiving or someone is birthday
i just idk how to put it but it is been on my mind for so long i am not alone but i feel so lonely i gave up on alcohol and nicotine a few weeks now and i still keep it up but it feels as if there is a void in me that can not be filled no matter what i do
she was confused because she found me attractive finds me funny and we get along amazingly but said she was slowly losing sexual interest in me because of how bad i am how insecure i was starting to get
i am too depressed to make strides in my life knowing that on the other side are a bunch of people conversing with good energy
it is gotten to the point where if this pandemic had not started i would hire a professional cuddler for sometimes truly outrageous prices i do not care big spoon little spoon platonic or not i have ceased to care at this point
i never want to be connected with anyone else on that level i still feel committed to you i know that is not reality anymore
i should add that i never felt that we had any problems with our relationship of course she felt differently but she never even talked with me about it so i was really shocked to hear it and it was too late by the time she told me
my main problem is that after i grew older my parents became somewhat distant even more so when i moved out not in an unusual way in fact i visit them every weekend but i mean i am not a child anymore so i do not get the hugs and all the physical contact you get from caring parents as a kid

i do not feel like i am afraid to die though i would prefer to kill myself if i would do anything i feel like i am in peace with death in some way
it is like when you are young a friend is anyone who you can talk to your not worried about them liking you and you have no expectations on what friendship has to be like you just talk to them and enjoy their company i need to return to that kind of thinking by clearing my mind of doubt and expectations
we are each others everything we have both never been this close and open and comfortable with anyone in our lives and i am so close with his family i just can not bare to break up with him no matter how many of my friends who know the whole story try to encourage it
no one can help most even claim there is nothing inherently wrong with me besides the fact that i want nothing more than to stop
she becomes particularly attached to one of her new guy friendsi fell into a hole myself i stopped going out and got depressed

this happened every year each new year brought a new suicide scenario and suicide note and as the only gay child in a homophobic family these suicide bears came off less like pranks and more like suggestions
sometimes i would send a dry response and would be left on read i normally used to reply trying to spark conversation but she does not

he needed to get help and he needed to do it for himself not for me or anyone else i am so tired of this i am tired of being my own torturer
i wish i could tell you right now my feelings but until then i will just anonymously post on the internet to release this tightness in my heart
i am glad that i did not do anything sexual with him i am glad he showed me in such few days he did not actually change just wanted something to wipe his shit on when he felt like it and i am mostly glad that i will not have to hear him lie to my face and say he loves me again
we broke up bc he was a fear avoidant so he called it off and everyone said this type of person does not really miss their ex instead they just keep having rebound so i was not expecting my ex to miss me or anything but deep down i think he does
she blamed me for everything but still told there was a chance things could be worked out was being hot and cold with me for months with periods of asking for space and would not clearly tell me if we were broken up or on a break and trying to figure things out
we were each others first real love we shared secretsanyone else experiencing the same thing or has any way of fighting lonelinessi do not know man i am fucked up
i am so scared to manifest these thoughts and i do not know what to do it is causing me so much stress and anxiety

after that situation happened we have lots of trust issues with each other i become very jealous and he hates me for that
it seemed to me that if i was able to actually become a web developer if i was able to learn all this and actually secure a real job and work in this industry then i am set i have a job that is both cool and respectable i do what i like doing i earn money i do something with my life relationships would happen naturally
i also attempted to take a bunch of advil pills but i could not do it whenever i felt hurt inside i wanted to just hurt myself on the outside
how can fix it ahhh fuckkkkkkkkkk meeeee i can not stop crying thinking i may not be mature enough for him that is pretty laughable now
in the past years i have thinking about an idea of how to help people who feel lonely since i suffered that kind of feeling so many times in my life
another way that loneliness really slaps you in the face is when you need to buy something huge but do not have a friend to call to help you carry it up to your apartment
most frightening of all however are my thoughts i have been heavily paranoid recently always thinking my friends are up to something bad thinking they dislike me or are planning something
it is the holiday season here in israel and we are on covid lockdowni am home alone no one around i wonder if i can ever survive this

nobody will have to sit through my voice ever again i am sorry for all the hurt i have caused world some days i just wish i no longer existed in this world i feel so lonely

she called me a lot of times so after 30 days i spoke to her and it was closed she offered to be friends i denied i never spoke to her after that

i am not the type of guy saying i am not going well even if i guess it is not too hard to figure i am not well so i never speak about how i feel to family and friends because i do not want to be a burden or loose my few friends
even though i knew she had been with a whole shit ton of men at this point confirmed by several of my friends she fucking insisted that i was the father and started trying to extort a bunch of money out of me
i wanted to try again so stupid i felt that i failed to die i was put through xrays and turns out i broke both my feet
please share your advice how should i handle all this i can not say that things would have been different they just seemed inevitable
i tried to reach out on here last night the holidays have been horrible i have been so fucking alone i feel so much fucking pain every day i just do not want to fucking do this anymore
i am 18 m currently in 12th grade and a few months from now i am expected to be in college i dread every month the upcoming college years and my transition to early adult life
the issue is i am getting mixed signals she has said repeatedly on these dates about taking it slow and that she is not sure what she wants
now i will add that these people walked out because of the colossal asshole that i was i have changed alot recently and hope i am improving everyday
i spent 19 years of my life bottling up everything being deprived of any form of affection from my family and she showed me what it feels to be loved
i am grateful for my family but i feel like i do not fit in my dad is more religious and my mom is not as much but she is from india
no i do not mean people who score really high on exams or get into great colleges or win competitions or any of that bs i mean just genuinely smart and intelligent people with an above average intellectual depth
i also know that due to my other trauma with people i have major trust issues adding to the list my fear of losing someone dear to me by death is downright crippling also i am hyper self aware when it comes to my psychological issues which brings me to the point of this post
or i found a new place at the forest at an trip where i controlled my friend hes goes to tree i never see befor talking from hees mind something liek look at it here is something for you
after almost a month i got her to tell some of the truth she had kept from me and that is she had been talking with him and met him behind my back when we were together it is been bothering me so much destroyed my feelings and my mental health i do not know what to do anymore
at a certain point i thought i wanted him back as a boyfriend but i realised i just missed him as a person
i escaped an abusive situation and was kicked out of my home 2 years ago and things have only gotten worse from there
genuine question what is the point i dealt with the existential aspect of that a while back if this j pouch surgery does not increase my life quality dramarically i have nothing left to live for
its been 11 months since melanie and i split i feel like i compare every girl to melanie especially with jordan
i genuinely like helping people and am always thinking of people bye for now sorry if this is a lot of reading for you
the only reason i did not down an entire bottle pills and drink myself into an early grave on christmas eve was because of her
i reminded her of all of our amazing times together like our first date when she texted me afterwards saying thank you for the best first date she would ever had
a part of me believes her wholeheartedly that she has had a lot of self growth but i am also pretty scared of her
no guys delete these things from your brain these are toxic intentions to have when trying to recover again recover move on and work on yourself for yourself
the next day i worked 12 hrs on my bday my boss texted me at 11 pm in the night asking whether it was my bday i replied yes he never wished me after that just ignored me
people were very kind for that day and the following but after that people go about their business and i am left alone
i literally just left it there and went back to bed in my work clothes i feel ashamed to say it but
i have been struggling with major depressive disorder since my adolescence i would explain everything i have gone through but the story is far too long
this is a short section of one of my articles firstly do not engage in any sort of overly positive and selfaggrandizing selftalk
recently my currently boyfriend who is been with me for more than a year just texted me saying i have lost all attraction for you and that he is been holding back on telling me that for a while what is something wrong with me i do not know what to do i mean i should care for myself i should call for a break up but again for the same reason i am so sad
my theory is that it could be focal onset seizures partial seizures since most of the symptoms i experience coalesce with the symptoms described
but i am slowly losing that emotion i am being so comfortable within my own solitude that despite genuinely caring for people i do not really think about them i do not know why it is so
i really wish i did not i woke up to him early in the morning throwing up over the side of the air mattress
it hurts now but it is better to go through that hurt now than to regret it in the future know now what you want in your future and what you do not
me and my sister were ther only grandchildren so we are more or less obligated to carry the torch she held up for so long
do you wish it finds you at your worst so that you can drag someone to your pile of sadness and probably mess it up even more
i can not truly open up to anyone because i scare them make them sad or they are mandated to report me to others who make it worse
it is weird how some people leave a deep impact and then you are never the same there is no point to this post lol i just felt like posting thoughts
a couple years ago i turned to this thread to vent along with so many other sources and i want to be proof that everything does get better over time
in all likelihood i will never talk to her again she is blocked on everything and i have not spoken to her since august
everything seems so pointless i am so tired of existing just bc i do not want to hurt my relatives if i die i am so so so tired i am tired of people saying it gets better when it is not true for everybody bc everyone has different situations in life i am so weak i have no will power or spine to start doing something with my life why am i even here at all
so this is the end now we had a conversation and i really thought it would be i have realised that you do so much for me and i appreciate it etc but instead it was i enjoyed my freedom and i did not have time to miss you till i seen you now and now my heart hurts
just could use some advice with my situation i am slowly approaching the end of me or the beginning of a life where i will be a bum
why was i given a life of misery and depression all the bad things and abuse that i have gone through
i am not doing well right now in general and my hypersexuality is out of control and i just want to fucking end my life because i am in a cycle
this is my main problem in life but things have being going to shit lately i lost my savings in the stock market got fired from my job moved back in with my parents
for as long as i can remember i have had brief instances of hatreddisgustrevulsion that last for about a minute or so
but i figured i would rather have these friends then be alone again i stopped when i met this woman but because of miscommunication and mostly my stupidity i have hurt her greatly
if you are worried you will embarrass yourself learn to laugh off your mistakes and do not take yourself seriously and others will do the same
a few days in she has to go into the hospital from low oxygen along with my dad who started feeling symptoms she was admitted fir a few days my dad who tested positive also diagnosed with pneumonia was sent home
sorry in advance for formatting i blame being on mobile for whatever kind of garbage this looks like and be warned it is looooong
i am still in love with my ex ofc he broke up with me and lost someone who i thought was my best friend over it
very few teachers would recognize me if they saw me today i was always quiet and shy especially in front of my teachers
she was having a zoom meeting with some therapist or dr and most of her time was spent talking about me
i had not cut myself since last year when i was 19 but i recently had some kind of fitepisode where i had a total melt down and ran into my house tore apart a plastic razor like a psychopath and used the blade to deal some really deep cuts that were definitely out of character for me
but none of it helped still i remained on the outside last year i started a new job for which i am studying and taking exams
i have learned to deal with the bad thoughts and the loneliness but what bothers me the most is how i am not capable of completing any tasks outside of my actual job like at work i feel energetic and i can complete many tasks and try my best but i have many unpaid bills get tired from just doing my laundry and can not get myself to do any cooking and cleaning
she makes a list of all the things she should be doing big or small and i assign point values which she can redeem for rewards
the absence accompanies me every night embracing me like how a lover would yet its touch makes me shudder i wish not to be rude but i think it is time this ghost and i go our separate ways
i always felt out of place though everyone was already in other matters and i was not prepared for anything at all
as time has gone on i have started realizing that maybe i am doing okay maybe i can be satisfied and happy with what i have got and have achieved i have also realized that i have a really hard time understanding what i want in life
not today is another fantastic short film that depicts a man battling suicidal thoughts as seen in his head short films like this help us remember that we are not alone and depressing thoughts are a part of the universal human experience check out phillipe jolys short film here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvmilscnkkvafeatureyoutubehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvmilscnkkvafeatureyoutube and for more films like this go to httpswatchargocomhttpswatchargocom for more
i have been thinking about my failed suicide attempt and it is been eating at me i went to work the next day acted as if it never happened
he ended our short relationship due to depression and still getting over a toxic ex i suspect things with us just moved really fast and it was too much
almost immediately i started to get worse from mild depression my condition became almost critical like the victim of any sexual misconduct i told no one one day enough was enough
one of them was put down a few months ago and i felt nothing but a slight sadness the other was just put down today and i felt hardly anything again
a couple days later this led to a conversation that led to our breakup because of multiple conversations and arguments about how i did not trust him
he is said he is depressed in the past but the break up is really causing his depression to flair up he has said before that if he did not have my sisters and i he probably would have killed himself
i really need to talk to someone who might be able to help me but i do not know where to begin
it was pretty miserable and i have yet to get over myself he cheated on me multiple times forgot my bday and on and on
almost anything you can think of that you are not born with the ability to do i struggle with it can affect my typing texting talking focus handwriting reading and soon enough probably my driving which is very scary to me
even though it was so horrible i would still talk to him because i felt so beyond alone sometimes he would be horrible to me and remind me that actually he is my ex
more callsmore chats all goods and bad we solved at our own all ups and downs we handled with grace and about everything we were assured about
i am almost always in a good mood trying to find the silver lining and just happy to be alive or at least a majority of the time til i start thinking about how lonely i am
it was 50 i had the receipts i tried to show him that i bought it and how all the money was accounted for
i have never spoken to health professionals therapists or anybody until fairly recently talking to my family about some mental issues i had gone through
i find it hard to talk to females because scared of rejection i find that i am always working because it is the one thing that keeps my mind of stuff
i have no idea why but that struck me so hard as like i cared because i really do not see a reason to care but i guess i do so after that i have been thinking about said person quite often and wondering why am i thinking about him like why
i said i am glad you liked it can i ask how you are doing which she did not answer it is been six months and we have not spoken at all
recently me and my wife had a series of long conversations about my future plans and if it was worth staying with my previous employer
i did not ask for help i did no one responded i have got so much to live for but at that point it felt like i had lost it all
this was my first real relationship i have had plenty of lovers but this was the first time i have ever asked someone to be my girlfriend
i was really the only person in her life she could trust and she told me everything and anything about what goes on in her nonessential brain
except for whenever she appears in my dreamsi am starting to feel like my life is over i am 24 years old
her goal is me out of my dads life and she will not stop i am just tired his mom said i can call her mom she helped me look for my first car
now a week had passed and people around me keep asking why did i broke up with this person and i could not tell them why either it made me feel like i am the bad person for leaving such niceguy
highs of productivity but excruciating emotional energy then terrible numbness and sometimes peaceful neutrality and then crazy deep depression i have no answers as to why i am this way or what i can do to stop it
i have to find someone else to talk to i do not have a lot of family i am basically an orphan with abusive parents i disowned
and do not tell me not to sleep with him my mind has been completely made up just please help me figure out how to make him feel something again
because the one i love the most left me for other interests our body is reacting in different ways to the pain crying in different unusual occasions
that he does not care if i am hurt i have to deal with it when i said what we had was beautiful he said no it was not beautiful
maybe the one good thing about this is that i am already so used to this even as a kid i did not feel like i would ever fit in or connect with people i have managed to be fairly successful in some aspects and find things that i love to do but sometimes i wonder whether it is even worth it if i can not share all the good things with someone
it is creating a panic attack for me even though there is a lot of reasons why she might not be able to answer
i can not remember the sensations of holding someone is hand it started when i got some bumps in the back of my throat and they started to bleed once
what can i do how can i help him can someone help me please i feel like i can not do anything although we are so close as hell
is there a way to prepare for something like this merry xmas and stay safe watch your loved ones close i wish someone was here to watch me
she is always been there for me in times of trouble but it is never been this bad and i do not think she can put up with my shit for much longer
it was a tough relationship to get out of but i managed to leave i am dreading going back because of this lockdown was amazing for me as sad as it is
i try to eat but i feel so anxious that i get super nauseous and can not do it i try to sleep but every day consistently i have been waking up at 4am in a cold sweat from an anxiety attack
sometimes i have a thought in my mind but do not bother getting it out to someone because you know what is the point
i have seen him out at bars in our area where he was kissing a girl and one time going home with a girl
for now the plan is that i have to figure out a way that ensures real continuous progress in genuine cool mutually sincere and fun relationships nothing else can even begin to begin getting off the ground until that condition is satisfied which makes this scenario very tricky
because they want to fill the gap of look everyone i asked about him personally and i am doing my best to be the better person here
say it out loud manifest one day you will wake up and spend the rest of your day without thinking about him anymore
i go to college where i am one of the tough guys and am quite popular amongst athletes and normal people because of the news
like why did not he tell me immediately when he knew he could not make it i would have understood but that way i felt played
the latter is a path i have been down a few times in the distant path and it is hard to remember sometimes the damage that was caused
of course i do not show this because i want to help i do not remember the last time i approached someone and they were interested
she blocked me a few days after the breakup but at one point she unblocked me so i messaged her that i understand she does not want any contact whatsoever but i keep thinking about her and her daughter and we got in contact again
i do not know what else to say but thank you for reading me but you did not choose me you decided to let me go
my family loved her and my friends liked her everything was perfectly fine but she explained to me one day that she needed a break from me to get her life together and once she had done that get back together
i hate being transgender it is the fucking worst when i came out to my parents they beat me and i bled and cried myself to sleep that night they also called the only man who was capable of loving me and accused him of sexually assaulting me
it would basically be like i am dead the things that i am holding on to in the past that no matter how hard i try i could get rid of the person would not be me anymore maybe they could be better not having all these thoughts holding them back in life
i felt better about it and did not miss him that is much over the past two days but i had a dream about him last night that left me confused when i woke up
did your ex resonate with any of the above points if so you have dodged a bullet fuckeralso any feedback on my definition is welcome i think it has room to grow and evolve
merry christmas to everyone i wish everyone many more of this christmas was a great one but the most unfortunate thing there is that i did my christmas all alone because i broke up with my boyfriend because he is a cheater and a liar i wish someone just add me up and say me a lovely word and clear my boredom my name is juliet
spoileddisrespectful and all the things that are wrong i did those things not trying to beat myself here just being honest with myself and the world no bullshit
i decided to leave the relationship and they attempted suicide after that this behavior has gotten worse and worse and now it is slipping into everyday life
i tried over the course of 8 hours to work it out he said he still loves me and wants to be with me but he can not give me another chance
hi guys wondering if anyone else was going through has been through the same sort of thing i work at the same place as my ex who broke up with me nearly 4 months ago
we broke up in august of 2019 we have seen eachother around campus a few times but we never spoke once he waved but i looked away
i attempted to strangle myself again but hated that vibration that i was feeling so i stopped i feel stupid but also kind of laugh at myself for attempting it
my life started to fail since i started taking them i do not know what to do tbh i also think about the inevitability of death because after being raised a christian my whole life
i can not afford a therapist so i have tried to do a lot of self reflection on my own and think it stems from my insecurity of my body that was amplified in my relationship with him we used to go to the gym together all the time and would talk down on me all the time like i was never good enough
i lose track of my thoughts at times and my body just kind of takes over and starts doing things perfectly fine
i hate this body i hate that i was born this way life is agony and every time you try to poke your head up it is going to stomp on you with a steel toe boot
my friends are all busy trying to help him and i can not trust my family any more i do not know what to do right now and i do not want to think
even when i know i have an assignment it is extremely difficult for me to force myself and make myself start and do the task
now here i am days away from my 25th birthday for as long as i can remember i never imagined that i would be here
does anyone else pay so close attention to their body that they manage to manifest physical sensations of pain i have been doing this for over a decade now and it is starting to feel overwhelming
i know i am only young but i have always thought how pointless and hard life was and how we go to school for education to get a job and basically work until we die and get old
hi everyone i know there is much more pressing matters and others in worse situations but if anyone is willing to help i would gladly appreciate any words you may have
last year i just started seeing a psychiatrist who had prescribed me antidepressants but they did not really improve my overall mental health and around that time i had just opened up to some of my loved ones about my depression
ill enter every room like i own it to hide the anxiety but at the end of the day the tears will flow the sadness will grip me and the anxiety will whittle me into paranoia
it gives me hope everyday to see a message pop up and i find myself longing for them to message me
i thought i could do it be friends but i can not i was and i am still in love with him
when we broke up she said she felt guilty breaking up despite it being mutual since she is leaving i now think that the only reason we remained friends was because she did not want to feel as guilty
as of midapril it is really been next to 0 mutual communication and back in june she pretty much said she wanted things to stay the way they are i
i am loosing my mind i am lonelier than i was ever before i am 24m then i would return to my cycle of doubt and sorrow
i had the opportunity the night we broke up and following it i had the opportunity before my freakout over the facebook incident
working from home took away a lot of the anxiousness with my job in terms of being around too many people and commuting i got more free time had more money as i was not going out as much or spending money on music festivals
but i slipped i felt like everything i have been working on for the past year had been for nothingi am not expecting anything from this letter but for you to read and understand it
i regret almost every decision i made 5 years ago and feel like i should be in a better spot happier
i just feel so sad like i loved him a lot and somehow that was not enough to make him stay i was not enough to make him stay and like i know you should not compare but i really can not help it i think she is better in every way she is prettier writes better idk man she is better
the truth is at my core i am dead and i have been that way for a long time all that remains are these personas used to mask this void
when i snap out of this i am filled with immense dread as 14 of my day was completely wasted i was watching sad movies and listening to sad music last week
i make no sense she must have known this is when i needed someone the most and she just did not care
i do think putting myself first and learning to mind my business will make these next months ease on by i did tell him seeing him facetime her and moving on so fast hurts and he understands
today he told me he still have feelings for me but loved me everyday less and less than he was thinking about me less everyday
i spent 3 years in this way it is absurd and i feel so guilty for it but it was like a nightmare
how can you go from best friends to strangers so quickly i have never felt pain like this i am a whole pile of crumbs today
i do not know what to do i have tried absolutely everything i can think of but all she wants is to die she says the only reason why she is still alive is because she does not want me to grieve her death so now she is begging me to let her take her own life
when you just want to for once in your life be on could nine opinions are welcome i need someone to talk to to or anyone feeling like i do
yet when i was in eighth grade they did not care about my grades all they cared about is that i tried my best
and no they are not sex dreams which i could just probably brush off they are just these weird dreams when you can actually feel their arms around you in your sleep but wake up to realise it was all just a dream feeling emptier
i am 16 years old and i am the only child in my family i was born in australia and moved to singapore when i was 7
i could not breathe and i was crying and i could barely stand up at this point my dad was sleeping and my mom was comforting me
i have been struggling with depression and i just feel like giving up and just ending it sorry in advance if i do i do not know if this is the right place to post this
even when my peers did not really care i still had people around me who were passionate about same or similar things and i could relate to
ask him who the fuck is crying just because someone hugs them he made me feel and think that there is still a place for someone like me in this world
the last of my childhood friends that i keep in contact with messaged me about a month ago i replied but have not heard anything from them since
all this stuff is hers so if she moves out then i am free to have plenty space and decorate how i want
it is never a doubt that i am an outcast as much as i try to fit in i never feel like i do i do not know what is wrong with me
where do i even start i have always been a positive person and i have always fought through adversity no matter the challenge i have always risen to it
at first things seemed to be going good as friends despite our breakup but slowly to me it seems as she does not put in anymore effort
i can not help him or myself and i do not want to keep feeling so useless anymore my friends are all busy trying to help him and i can not trust my family any more
is there something wrong with me i am not really sure how to approach myself on this any advice anyone has is appreciated
ever since covid started i have been in my house almost every single day ever since march and being in my house for so long with just my thoughts has been horrible
my parents does not know that he is a part of a gang and he is coming over to our house like 3 times a week
i do not have many friends living near me plus the covid makes things more difficult to go outside to socialize and change my mind
i just want someone to care for me the way i do about them the saddest part is i think it is impossible to find my search has come to an end but if you think you can do better please be my guest
but it did kind of hurt it means once again i learn that i am nobodys number one sighwhen you can not relate to the quarantine loneliness posts because your life is the exact same
i hope you are happy you tore my heart out and stepped on it you lied to me for god knows how long was it the whole time how long were you cheating on me i never wanted to check your phone because i trusted you so fucking blindly i was not worried about any of this until now i was so sure that you were as blindly loyal and faithful as i have been
the best thing for you to do is grieve do it let all the tears out burn his shit block him on socials delete the pics and get something for yourself do not check on their ig it does not matter what they are doing they chose to leave buy plants get new lingerie or take some bombass pics whatever works for you
if you are scrolling through looking for answers do yourself a favor and seek therapy i am not licensed to guide you through your thoughts and emotions but there are people who are trained to help even if you never did it before or never think you would need it
i am a pretty lucky person i got a full scholarship to an expensive private school and my family is not abusive or anything but i feel like i am kind of messing everything up
i know that this would not be good for my overall physical and mental health but i also think it is good that i technically do not notice my anxiety as it just feels normal
i have told my friends i am 10 months clean and they just say nice they have both self harmed and not gotten as addicted to it as i am but still
when he came home and saw my cuts he took me out for a walk or eating snacks i think and that is it
to make the situation worse the last time me and my ex talked we were playing that same game together and got into a huge argument where he confessed that he is already talking to someone new
i broke up with girlfriend last year and have a really strong desire to cuddle it is like feeling starved i end up cuddling pillows etc but hardly comparable
i can not take living this fake life i do not deserve my friends and i do not deserve anything i have as a result of my sa i started to feel lonley and depressed till my 20
i am really sorry you have been feeling down lately if you want i can unblock you and call you tonightis what i would say if i was stupid and did not have any selfrespect
i am 16 years old i do not want to feel like this my whole lifeso i am not sure how healthy this is i think it is ok
addiction issues and bpd were enough to tempt going outside of my marriage for a bj i told her about all of it
my god i know the gift thing is selfish because my dads guitars og nintendo consoles and ps4 are down there but
we talked and he said he wants to work things out then proceeded to tell me that his ex wants face to face closure
repeated draining toxic negative interactions with said parent and fighting the battles to minimize those over time even when working full time in web dev living on my own with good check
i feel like i have some goals but they are not strong enough to motivate me also the corona situation also affects me mentally bad not just me everyone actually
others instead may have someone but still feeling alone because they are not understood or not accepted for who they are
in retrospect and because she was bad at keeping a story straight i knew she had hookups in that timeframe with at least 5 people that i know of
so if anyone is interested i am in the uk female 30s and happy to talk to either male or female maybe dm and we go from there
this morning he drained the life out of me i told him there was no reason for him to talk to me disrespectfully and to him the reason was because i was acting entitled that he was supposed to ship my stuff but he offered to help me ship my stuff so i took the offer
it is crazy because i could see myself taking my life yet i would still stop someone i care about from doing the same thing
he shared all my tasteshad a successful careerseemed like the full picture after 2 weeks of just text conversation i find his facebook with him and his wife
i do not blame anyone for the way i feel but sometimes i wish my parents could be there for me and i could tell my mom this without being scared she will not take it seriously or that she might do something to herself in fear i will do it first
we were spending more time together than ever he opened up to me and told me things he never told anyone else he told me he could not wait to spend the holidays with me
it feels invalidating to anyone who underwent all this trauma hundreds of therapy sessions searching for a medication that fits you etc
we have been dating for 4 years and around 2 years without interruption this time i am heartbroken and she seems unbothered
i was the youngest in the family along with my brother who spent time with my parents more because of route routine and my closest cousin in age was ten years older than me
most days even thinking of going out to meet my friends and family sounds too tiring and taxing for me to handle
everything between then has been pretty superficial and few and far between with covid going on i have been isolating and made an exception for this
i liked a girl who was batchmate and my friend she also knew that i liked her we use to chat twice or thrice in a weak but when i asked her she just simply denied saying that she wanted to spend time with herself as she had a breakup a year ago
first time posting here never really felt like i was able to make a strong connection with people in my life
at first we agreed to talk sometimes during the week and hangout during the weekend but then we recently agreed on no contact because that was too much because of expectations
i still think about our cute moments together and all the nice things he said to me but i also hate him
i am loyal i do not ever go over my promise i am not too assertive or nagging seriously i have no idea what is going on
which is pf course not good for development you do not want to put much effort when an ass is more important in how most people treat you
i am starting to feel really worried about my girlfriend she told me a few hours ago that she hallucinates a lot
i am always in pain and i do not think anyone gets me i will maybe go and watch some tv or youtube videos and feeling just vanishes
i have always struggled with anxiety and obsession especially when i was younger i have not really looked for help because i have been feeling better over the years
i am having a very hard time letting go of my ex we are still crazy about each other the issue we broke up and i got pregnant by a rebound i wanted to terminate but decided mentally i would not recover this was 4ish weeks ago we had not talked much since then
from then on it seemed like all my friends cared about was talking to this guy a daily fight to just fucking hold on for a little longer
and it really helped because that time it was much easier for me i did not suffer for a couple of weeks but almost immediately came to my senses and continued on my way in search of love
when i met him my guard was up but he worked on me he was so kind of and patient with me
we were headed straight back for the old pattern of disrespect tantrum blame and convincing me it is all my fault and i need to grovel for forgiveness
until one day he decided to tell me that he fell in love with someone else and to be fair i should have seen the signs
when i needed the most support of her she did that i have nothing to offer her which her friends can not
in all honesty i would rather give up a kidney or put myself under a coma than go through that again
there is a lot of love in the household and that is all and well and fine but to not have a damn thing to give as a present that papa and mama had bought themselves on christmas
i feel like i might be ready to start dating again but i also do not know if i am just feeling super lonely should stay single
lately i have been finding myself nostalgic and kind of missing my life in 2017 which i just find weird since i was super depressed and miserable at the time and also feel the same for 2019 which also a very bad year for me idk if these means anything or i am just being weird
me and my ex broke up due to me being immature and saying goodbye over text i never really wanted to leave her but i felt in that moment i wanted to say goodbye and then i messaged her a few days after saying i know deep in my heart we could fix things and make things work but i knew it was already too late to fix what i have done
the thought of food has made me throw up on many occasions i also have not cleaned his litter box in so long christmas used to be so magical
since corona and everything i was not able to go see this girl and we facetimed everyday and i never got to meet her she blocked me on everything because we got into a bad argument it is been about 6 months and i am still upset about it
i know it is best for me to let you go i will always love you please if anyone is struggling please message me on here on instagram saaam_jones
this devastates me i hate that i made any woman let alone five feel this way i feel like such a waste of everything there is too much stress for me
i can not tell my family and friends because they would worry or judge mei can not tell my therapist because she would have me institutionalized
but is all i can do i do not want empathy or pity that is not what i want all i want is a friend
but we spent weeks there after the breakup which was his decision after several months of depression for him and ever since we used to talk and share about us at the begining it became really unbearable the last days
so i have just left an mmo i had been playing for 2 years about 6 hours a day every day except when i go to work
thank you for taking the time to read this if you have any question please feel free to dm me i may not get to you right away so please be patient i do not check my reddit often enough
i do not even deserve pity because i was a bully too i post this and i am going to feel like an attention who are
i could write in my journal and i am sure i will slowly shift that direction but right now knowing that someone might read this and it might resonate with or even help someone is something i need
i am happy to say that i am finally starting to feel like myself again my gf 21 broke up with me idk like 3 months ago
i do have a physical condition but that will go away eventually but it is over it was a very serious relationship which lasted for more than 4 years
she taught me how to love how to be practical and what i should put effort in defending i was honestly nothing when she met me and she changed me to be someone i am proud of
i have sent her mail because she was kind enough to let me know a postal address where i could write about what i am experiencing
well i have been really trying to accept it is over and be okay about it i have been struggling a lot but am trying
i welcome you all on my journey from being a doctor of medicine to seeker of happiness i have began with the road less taken and i wish to make the best of it
i wish ppl treated each other nicer over the internet me includedi am feeling lonely what should i do how to fight it
10 year old me would be so let down she would be very upset to know that her 22 year old self would be like this 18 year old me would have had a massive panic attack if she knew i was like this
i am 19 and all my friends left me when i came out as trans over a year ago and i have been too anxious of being abandoned to have a real social life since
so i just hole myself up in my room and listen to music that gives me a sad nostalgic feeling which makes me even lonelier
11 years he is always had a crush on me and last year in september i decided to give it a chance
i have never read about someone having random complete dissociation from myself temporarily like this without it being a different personality think did
only thing keeping me alive are my cats or escaping through my computer and sleeping to make things even worse our university management decided to conduct offline exams and i am a mess right now
so i feel his absence in every second of my day i can not be mad it was your choice but still it hurts
my current boyfriend first ever of 25 years just told me he has fallen out of love with me even though he says he still holds me dear he is so special to me i have never had this sort of connection with anyone
i am only 16 years old i was feeling better yesterday but today became worse i feel weak and scared when i die will i see black forgot to say i posted here yesterday also
i tried to hide it my parents only knew like 4 months ago when out of nowhere i broke in tears at lunch
i do this sort of thing all the time the same sort of thing happens when it comes to the dating scene
if you feel the same way as i doplease state your reason cuz i am quite curious to find out why this is true for some people
it had been 3 days i woke up at 4 am shaking and crying i was in a sweat and so anxious
i felt helpless and alone for the first time in my life but i was not i had my family and friends to support me through all that stuff i went through
my social anxiety is stopping me from literally just hanging out with people something as simple as drinking and watching a movie at someone is house terrifies me
after 3 months of healing and trying to move on from my past relationship under strange circumstances me and my ex started talking to each other
whilst my partner and me are still together the moment my choice i want to try and build myself up and to show him i am strong and independent but i can not shake the feelings of loneliness shame and general pain in my heart
at that time we were in a different countries so we just contacted he brother who lived in the same country as she
i took nc harder than her and i reached out twice to talk about maybe staying together because some of ld problems had been solved
we actually bonded over the love for domesticity all those years ago it was the best thing for us two to spend a day grocery shopping and touching towels in ikea all that stuff
from august till now i had school and to be honest tinder to distract me but lately i have just been in a sad place and not feeling like myself
individual therapy was also a tough excruciating journey the therapist i saw in the beginning of the year told me that the childhood traumas i went through were kids just being kids i almost had a mental break i did not start therapy again until october with a different therapist
i am questioning because at this point i do not know what to think loneliness and isolation is haunting me since childhood will i ever escape this i am just so fragile fir socialising i want to fight but i do not know how will this ever stop will i ever be strong enough to endure and overcome the rich and sometimes painful world of socialising
i never reported it to the police out of fear that no one would have believed me so i forced myself to forget
me what do you mean like in general yeahhim no you do not remember what happened with us and the teacher while we were backstage
i feel so worthless and so ugly i am so stupid for ever thinking that something good could ever happen to me
3 it has been 2 months she is the one who broke up with me and is living the life she wants why would she be mad at me going on a date with someone i did not shove it in her face she found out
i am failing what am i supposed to even do if i am so damn constrained so i will just commit suicide when you want to stop being lonely or die when you just want someone to talk to
so i started phasing out the med by cutting the pills in half and have been doing that a few weeks and have now managed to go one or two days usually because i forget without taking it and while i did notice some mental weirdness symptoms which i have read are pretty common during a period of ssri withdrawal including these odd brain zaps which very much remind me of a similar feeling i have experienced when being really high on marijuana dizziness vivid dreams etc
after my gf passed i had met a woman from another country now i am disabled to travelling is not simple neither are funds
then it was wanting to make sure my family had a good christmaschristmas is here and soon it will be gone i have tried finding something but nothing feels like enough
every night memories flows into my head and i just feel sick i feel like a disappointment or just some kind of gross person
i know they were real but i can not feel any attachment to those memories anymore like i read them in a book once and now i can not ever truly read that book anymore
i do not mean to be a bother i just want to end this spiral and also maybe get proper help besides just finding the closest psychiatrist
you were so shitty to me you love them you always have but you still made me feel we had a chance
no one left other than my wife but i can not let her know it is too hard for now i only have you the strangers of the internet
i just googled some excercises and hope they will help in the meantime i would like some advice and opinions now i am on the lash out started deleting fb friends being super cranky and angry
the rest of the time i just spend in bed waiting for medicine there is no privacy and being the only foreigner i feel like a circus exhibition
for anyone who does not know anything about art therapy here is a definition and an example of one of the exercises from my blog
everybody was supposed to cut ties with him because he did not complete the course but because of my family being very large his sisters and brothers as well as his parents just could not do that
i can not overcome my laziness because i am too fucking lazy i am trapped i not at home playing video games for once i not as stressed out as always
so remember this you can not stop thinking but you can change your thoughts thoughts are like clothes if you do not like them you can change them
i even begged her to friend zone me because i did not want to be alone especially since i was griefing but she did not want to talk with me ever again
there was an incident where we went to go pick up a friend of mines phone from a party and her and i got pistol whipped i will spare you the details
i am so damn lonely i do not even know how i do it anymore i would lose it if i felt human touch again the emotional overload would shut me down time to walk the slow march of death
loneliness is likely going to stay with me forever some people tell me i should not give up and just keep knocking at every door
i feel like i am moving on but i am scared that i am it does not feel like christmas without her i just want her to yell at me again or something
not sure how i feel during these two last weeks i find out that my best childhood friend and one of my best friend from studies times died they both are not even 30 i am 28 and that is not the age when your friends should start dying
when you exercise and eat well you are showing yourself that you matter and you care you want to be around people with the right energy
i was listening to the album non stop and for the first time since a very long time i actaully felt happy i had my saturns return being 29 years old i felt so complete
she has lupus and its killing her not only that but because of the fact that she is chronically ill she does not see much point in continuing
i understand separation is not the most ideal topic to bring up initially but i was taking aback that it was not communicated
it is like i did not really feel the need to do something but at the same time saw it happen in front of my eyes while wanting to intervene but powerless
during our small convo she randomly informed me she is found someone else and is not trying to place it in my face
today one of my close friends from college got married and i opened my snapchat to see all of our mutual friends at his wedding
i do not know much about tech or game making myself but i know from him that getting a game recognized was his biggest nightmare among all other creators he was also negotiating with some publisher which was going to basically rip him off a huge percentage of the game profit just for recognition
one time after a fight he said i have been thinking about you and i got worried but he said to me i stepped outside and felt the crisp autumn air and i immediately thought about you i thought about all the fun we will have in our future he said i have always hated christmas but for once because of you i was excited about it i told him he was cheesy and i felt the same way but i do not think he ever understand how much it meant to me
i have become distant and i feel liberated by it 3 years of being with this man who i thought i was going to marry the breakup was horrible
i immediately realized my house was on fire and jumped into gear i left everything behind and made a brake to my moms room to wake her up
did he actually love me or did he just put up a facade for the entire year to use me for his own gain maybe in just reading a lil too far into this
so you think that could be the case going on day 72 of no contact and it is killing me he seems really happy from what i have been told and what i have secretly seen on social media
when i found out she was cheating i told her that i expected her to carry the weight while i struggled to look for reasons to stay
i have tried so damn hard to hate my ex so hard i tell myself i hate her i go over the messed up things she did i tell my friends i hate her i tell them she was horrible to me
i am just constantly on edge thinking of the million ways in which the world is out to destroy me every time i do try anything i am met with constant resistance
it made me realize something very important i can not be friends with herso a quick note of what i have learned
i am so tired of constantly feeling like everything i do is entirely pointlesshave you ever wished to have a better social life
whenever i try and figure out what goes on in peoples heads all i get is a whole load of garbage
i grew up in the same city where my university is went to high school there and all of my friends are from that city
a switch flipped at some point around then and i stopped being suicidal and my depression basically vanished but it is like the switch flipped too much and now i can not truly feel sad at all
and then no one around me is like me no one understands me i think people think i am doing it on purpose that i am not trying
she never came by to talk in person after that not that i expected her to anyway but i figured if she had any feelings for me whatsoever we could at least talk one more time in person
i know i am young but i honestly do not feel i will ever truly be in love or actually be respected or actually be happy
is being suicidal and constantly in fear how i should live my life they just tell me man upmy boyfriend and i broke up 6 months ago
i sympathized with her and apologized i can not see my therapist in person so everything has come to a standstill with her
sometimes there is a trigger and it can just about be anything a movie a song something i see anything and then i am just like this for a while i just feel sad and lonely and i shut myself off from friends and hide it from family
now i feel like i have been put right back i wish i was not the race i was born as i wish i was mixed
what am i supposed to do in this ducking situation i do not want to have to stay awake while they fuck each other senseless meaning every time i finally get my mind off the last time they do it again and i am back at square 1
hi i am 16 and i really want to get therapy but i do not want my parents or my school to get involved i have been struggling with mental health on and off for years and i heard therapy really helps i just really want someone to talk to my parents are part of the problem so i do not want them to know
i can not even imagine this in my wildest dreams he thought i am there for his money i love him but am unable to express to him
hey guys this is my first post here and i would have posted this in another group but i felt that this was the most suitable i was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety many years ago and i have been learning to cope with it and not beat myself up over it but recently its been spiking massively and i am at loss on what to do
the constant urge to cut has cost me my job due to the scars and i am currently in debt not to mention its causing the one i love to lose intrest which is making it only worse
there is something inside me and it jsut drains me inside outi have been drinking since then its been about 10 years since i was diagonosed with depression
i do not hear them or see them i do not feel like they are speaking either i only imagine them in ly head i am aware of that except i cany stop acting weird around them
the life lived with feeling all emotions is such a unique perspective it allows us to know that we are human beings and we are alive
i have never told anyone that i want to die even though i have felt like this for nearly half of my life
i got a job to distract myself working 48 hours a week while going to school hoping i would not have time to be depressed and heartbroken i was wrong
i would like so much to be able to be independent to have some friends a small studio and a small job
i could not have blamed her it would not have been right i was lost i broke down in tears and asked him to leave my room and go to his
i am a prisoner inside my own mindand home it feels like half the time and the other half welli am getting yelled at for leaving to go buy mcdonals at 11 at night or treated like i am still a child because apperently i am supposed to ask permission before leaving hahaha no
why do not they sympathize a bit with me what is the point you can not even live for free everyone is lives are monetized we are walking debts and even death costs money no one gets buried or cremated for free let me go i will give you everything i have just let me go death is expensive too it is okay i will pay for it just kill me or let me die please please please please please please
i understand that i need to stop obsessing and my thoughts are not me but i just cannot wrap my head around it that it does not hurt right now
i miss you deeply but if staying together makes both of us unhappy separating makes you free to go anywhere you want in the world and be happy then i want you be to be happy
i feel like it may be too just fade awayi have been ruminating regarding my ex and the experiences we shared including the difficult end
i am also a extremelly picky about everythingi think people who use having a bad memory as an excuse are pathetic mom
how in the hell do i create something out of nothing i can not look at myself my old life how i have behaved
if not can anyone tell me how to go about fmla this job is really killing me and i can not afford the just quit
across all of the counselling and medications i have tried nothing has proven to be effective and my symptoms still remain it has been such a hard few years and i am so devoted to finding something that will improve my quality of life although it seems hopeless after so many failed attempts
in the past couple of years i have been struggling with my mental health i tried to hide iti am going through tough break up
i barely eat and take showers anymore i am not taking care of myself at all you would leave me in fucking peace they are so fucking judgmental
you see he has been taking care of both our expenses for the past 2 and a half years but he recently lost his job due to covid and is in the process of finding another one
months later i had found out they had gotten a new facebook and not added me i do have one irl friend but they are more social than me and we do not hang out often
i wrote my therapist a letter that i am going to email her during my session talking about all of the things i have been meaning to tell her
every aspect of my life feels like it is stagnating i do not know where to go from here and although i want there to be a light at the end of the tunnel i just can not see it and do not know if i have the energy to keep going
there is a fear of what happens if it is not enough and i will never be truly happy i am scared that maybe this was all pointless and i am just doomed in this endless cycle
but overall i was definitely a lot happier i was not so chronically bored i was imaginative and found joy in small things as kids do
at this point now i am feeling huge amounts of resistance to the idea of putting extreme and intense volumes of work to solve issues where before it failed
i feel like an observer and do not have many friends just a small group even then i do not feel super close to most of them and i known them for years
i did try out a few counsellorspsychologists in my university in the past but they really did not do anything for me
it sure did changed my life my personality and the way i look at life but the loneliness is here to stay
one moment i want her back because there is not a moment i do not miss her and in that moment i start realising what i could have done differently what she could have done different and then the next moment i feel so much anger towards her that i just can not explain i do not want her back because i can not go through the pain she put me through when she left
i do not know when it is going to end but i am assuming i will not last another year like this this life is starting to suffocate me
does not really need an explanation but it keeps me up and it is fucking me up every time i am at my step dads house and it is always downstairs
i have been on a really low dose 50mg essentially the lowest dose of zoloft for about 3 years any girls that i have met in person have shown no interest in me
a lack of trust in others or the assumption that everyone else articulates their thoughts and feelings better or worse than themselves only perpetuates the disconnected feelings one has between others
i am not really good at talking about how i feel like i rarely know the right words to express how i feel and i do not really know how to express feelings in general and whenever i try talking about my feelings it kind of ends up as some weird joke i mean it sounds worse when i write it like that but it is just been like that in my family growing up i guess
he mistreated me and sometimes i feel deep pain and anger because of it yet another piece of me still believes i love him
day to day i am able to compose myself and live fairly ok even with the nasty thoughts that i get usually i can just say it is ocd and they will linger but not necessarily bother me that much anymoreprior to being diagnosed it was a lot worse
we liked doing the same things not going out not very social etc we had lots of fun together but he claimed he did not love me
i am very open to any kind of answers and i only need some reassurance on this if there is none then it is fine i will talk to my therapist thank you for your help have a great day
hello i am not sure why i write but i guess i would like to interact with people who maybe understand a little what i am going through please be kind it is quite vulnerable
does anyone else feel like the solitude of loneliness makes them feel super down so much so that you feel you are going crazy
he has not spoken to me since outside of work that is he has no choice there that is when he started getting mad
he even replies saying that i need to work on myself i wish i would not continue to ask this man for validation he does not deserve me
she refused i grabbed her by the arm led her to the door and pushed her out not hardhe lied about so many things and the things about amy really hurt me
she literally had no love left for me and felt that she had lost herself in the process when i heard those words come out of her mouth it destroyed me
according to the mental health association i meet 13 of the 15 criteria wondering how many of us were misdiagnosed and the va just said ptsd as a catch all
then me realizing that i can not really share any of these feelings with someone because firstly like i said i basically have no friends and the one person and friend that i know is a neighbor 2 years younger than me with whom i can not really talk about almost anything because honestly he is not that bright or that empathetic
but to know that this broad 30f is now going to see firsthand what i was talking about is repayment enough
everyday i worry in my life the reason i worry is because i have a fear of a specific punishment from gods that specific punishment was asked some times as a punishment in case breaking the promise with or without the cross sign
i am not sure if this is would really be all that inspirational but i committed myself last week this is the first time saying it to strangers
i am sincerely sorry for all of this i really am i know it was not supposed to be this way but i guess this is just how things turned out
this post talked about different accounts of people tilting from gamers to professional sports players and eventually mentioned something is about the conscious and subconscious parts of the mind
after i passed my examens for the lower level of course i had to going to the mbo this is a school were you need to go and eventually have the chance to still go to college
i am so tired of being trans going to off myself this year dealing with jealously all my life for cis woman and just dreaming all day wishing i was a girl such a boring life would definitly not recommend cya all 3
i was at the doctors yesterday and they have a monitor set up that flashes health stuff there was one about loneliness that said the effects of loneliness on someone is health is equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day i never heard that it seems excessive
but it is not same for me i know she has moved on and she had every right to but i can not get around this fact
i am writing this because today i woke up at 10am instead of 9am and she gave me the most disappointed and pathetic look as if being a late starter is a daily occurrence
i feel like i am suffocating i feel like its so quiet that i am being flooded 5 days ago that was his last activity
i can walk away with my head held high knowing i never cheated when i had plenty of chances i lost weight when i got back in the gym from 301 to 280
i have always tried to be a mild mannered person and have always done my best to be known as a kind person but i spend conservatively 30 of my day thinking about dieing and that is specifically just imagining ways to die
my mental health has deteriorated more than what it had been before due to numerous court battles between my parents as well as the control and manipulation they both used towards me in order to pick a side
ever since this pandemic started i have had fewer and fewer people reach out to me or respond when i message them
but its all over now i have crippled myself because of my stupidity and pride and if the only person i have left is my psychologist and friends that i do not deserve as they care but i am effectively treating like backup friends
i came over here from the suicidewatch subreddit the people there were of absolutely no help to me and only made me feel worse about my condition i do not need to be told to suck it up and move forward i am tired of hearing the same spiel over and over again i need some real answers an educated opinion
anyone out there with the corona virus blues i have not been working for almost 3 weeks and have not realized how just being amongst people made me feel
sometimes i google the actor and check up on the social medias so it kind of disassociates them from the film
my chest feels empty it is hard to find the motivation to do things i know i should do to make myself feel better
i keep hearing you are so stoic how do you deal with stress so well but the truth is i am crying inside just no tear flows out
i have no hope left of getting a real life i am just doneedit oh and i got absofuckinglutely nothing for christmas too
it is like i have to coach myself and that 4 year old version of me i have learned to be enough for myself and hug myself when i am down
she is now living with him i am sure because he just added her to his google home said that at the same time my mom died she aborted our child i did not know she was pregnant
not to mention you can exist without and existence is perhaps the only thing anyone is entitled to the rest is
ew why are your nails so long when they literally have fucking acrylics onor cut your hair as you do not have hair down to your fucking hips
i stay up at night and wish that i would die naturally that i would get cancer or any terminal illness
i guess that where we are now by the end of march b of of m my suffering ended or so thought i
if there was a movie about me it would be one of those movies where you think you are supposed to feel bad for the protagonist but in reality they are the villain and you miss the point by sympathizing with them i am nothing but selfish egotistical and insecure at the same time which drives me crazy how contradicting those last two are
well i am sick of it i am sick of everyone thinking i am crazy i will feel fine for a few days then have a huge breakdown about it
my depression is worse than ever i just wake up and cry christmas today just kind of reminds me of everything i have lost
like the title says i have literally nothing i have no dreams or aspirations i do not have any idea what to do after high school i am 99 sure all of my friends actually hate me i am a constant disappointment to my parents and other family i am failing school and 100 will fail this year and i can not do anything about it
i do not know wat to feel when i laugh i feel like i am faking it and i just feel like i want to burn myself to fucking feel shit i want to smash my head till it crack open i want to choke myself with my headset wire i just want to feel shit i want to fucking scream break shitakdj glkajbhfgilkoujafghopakljhfgklopjhkl
sadly i doubt i can ever regain what they took away in many ways one really frustrating way is that i only have one or two friends
what is really sad is he is supposed to be moving across the country in a couple months for work with or without her
but i know that is fucked up irrational thinking and deep down i know i can not do that i am pretty conflicted by myself and crying right now
he was immature and did not know how to communicate well and i was teaching him things were getting so much better and we were each others first everything
i am kind of proud of myself for that for some reason to have been able to see that far in the future but that is not the point at all
i see tons of people hanging out in the park dining outside etc together now and i am still alone with only faces on a computer screen
i did wish her a merry xmas back out of respect but i do not know what to do or understanding this
i am barely 23 days clean and i want to burn myself up completely i am so so tired christmas and new years is always tiring for me especially since i am turning 18 on the 28th
i entered a competitive university in a steam field my brain was sharp and i think clearly however i became sometimes hard on my self especially when receiving a criticism or not delivering high expectation i was a bit sensitive to it and become workaholic
neither of us seemed happy and i was exhausted mentally and tired of trying to make it work but i understand better now sometimes breaking no contact does help
i waited too long to apply to colleges and now i am screwed i have an ed and crippling body dysmorphia and i feel too ugly to be alive
about not wanting to have kids but not wanting to be alone about having to fend for myself in an oversaturated job market
among so many other things he hid all of the messages from me was mad at me when i found out
anyway i am literally spending an incredible amount of time sitting in my bed crying over him and missing him etc
he has been silent for almost three weeks now which is unusual i have reached out a few times first casually as to not put pressure on him because i assume he is having an episode i also sent him an email a couple of days ago trying to let him know that i am thinking of him that i am not angryupset and not going anywhere
i want to personally thank everyone who read my posts gave me insightful responses and ultimately giving me a place where i express my feelings openly without judgment
i never mentioned any friends past kindergarten stage in elementary school i would follow them around for fun but they never felt like friends i did not have any friends
maybe you can relate to the issues she brought to this relationship i can not and would love some feedback from you about why she feels the way she does and how she was so angry all the time
i was apparently good to them few years back when they had some sort of gain from me now that i need help they are nowhere around
i was looking forward to this winter break because i needed a while to relax but it is so disappointing i am afraid it will never get better
he is literally on my mind all day from the time i wake up to the time i go to sleep i only think of him
on one hand she was only 31 on the other i was 51 and i never needed anything more than than her ever but it was not meant to be that is hard to live with but i will get over it i was happy but i guess she was not
i never have the motivation for anything anymore i used to love to write but even doing that feels so hard these days
i am usually loud energetic and funny i could easily get along with people and i know how to make a room laugh
she could finally be free of my constant sadness and questioning her every action she would not have to worry about me at all
he did not do that instead he changed the subject it made me really stressed out and my anxiety was off the charts lmao
it started to get to the point where she would never text me unless i texted first when we used to have hour long text conversations every day
some guy scammed me reversed a big payment and the bank tanked my credit to 500 because of it i got no way to repay my debts so i just ignore the calls
shortly after his gf texted me to say thank you as well and told me that it was the only thing that put a smile on his face because he had an awful day yesterday i asked what happened and long story short if it was not for that card he may not have been here this morning she hid the keys for his gun safe just to be on the safe side
now new boyfriend let us call him tim23he is great also but no where near as great as alex i guess tim is more like a bad boy he is tall handsome and he really supports my passion in life the thing with tim is i do not think i can see us being together long
we were talking all day long everyday about 3 months into this i tell j about my situation and she is decently understanding
i am literally only still alive so my parents will not be crushed bc i am an only child but every single day i would rather be dead than as lonely as i am
my closest friends live far and although i am fine being alone most of the time recently i have been feeling really lonely
update i still think about his face of how he looks at me with surprise and in shock before i sleep i am more mad of myself he saw me and we were intimate physically not emotionally there yet but we were together i do not know how he can sleep and move on happily after what happened does not he have a conscience
and i even started talking to myself as if i was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what i am doing
it is depressingi just started nc 5 days ago and i am in a lot of pain but i have been hoping that i am going to heal and eventually feel a better quality of life but when i start checking other people out some people say they have been in nc for so long and still feel heartbroken
i am thinking of starting therapy soon i have heard that sometimes there is a need to change therapists due to them not being suited to your needs how can you tell if a therapist is right or wrong for you
my dad died in may while i am living in a different state so i could not see my family for months after it happened
its nice to talk to others in the chatroom but we never get to continue our friendship we only talk for the time we are there
torn between so nice to be on my own hehehe i just learned to be just with myself you know and fukkk i want someone besides me want someone being with me giving me hugs and affection to the max
it is just all i would need is a hug or something ya know social anxiety has well and truly destroyed me as a person and has taken my life
if we are going to die someday why we can not decide when it is better to empty my body and get free of this suffering i have been trying to hold on for too long now i need some rest i just want to see the light because i have been in the dark my whole life goodbye
i am an 19 year old girl who till this day does not any real friends i have lost so many friendships that i believe i am destined to be alone

so now when i miss my ex and feel upset that he does not talk to me that much he suggested being friends but barely speaks to me i try to remind myself that i do not want that life anymore of hanging out with the same judgemental people multiple times a week and almost never having any alone time
i told her that part of me is falling in love with her but i feel guilty because we are not at the same level of love not that i do not want to be or that i will not ever be but i am going to my own speed
i digress the issue was that my grandfather passed in 2016 i was staying with he and my grandmother he had a bad heart she dementia
jump 1 year post move she decides she wants to move areas so she can work with people near her own age more and try and find some new friends
the disadvantage of having this kind of life is for example if i meet a guy i am female and if we start having a relationship and he is mean to me i tend to do anything but get rid of him because i am afraid of being alone again in that way i accept toxicity into my life
so then what do i do what options have i laid out for myself here i know you know where i am going with this assuming anyones reading this
similarly i grew up bipolar and my psyche was scarred with the knowledge that i was a danger to myself and to others with my emotional issues and mania it was not until i met my now ex in 2018 that she helped me repair my self image of myself by loving me unconditionally and helping me unravel that negative self image but i never had that moment where it all clicked
i feel so annoyed bc i am 22 years old and i feel like i am going to get stuck being awkward and alone friendship wise forever
i can not quite meet new people right now because i am already in college and will be in the same college for the next 3 years
i think this is it for me there has always been a silver lining in the past but now there is none i am 100 fucked
did i overreact does he love me at all or was it all a front since he flipped on it so fast does he even plan on talking about it or is this how things end am i controlling and damaged is there a past i am not aware of with the two of them
i battled cancer a terrible ex husband got divorced had to feed and raise two boys on my own till they finish college
i have not been eating and sleeping much it feels like i have to force feed myself and i can not enjoy the taste of food
i have been broken up one month ago he broke up a perfectly healthy relationship from one day to another i was devastated
we were always together we told each other we were the love of our lives and were going to spend our lives together
but i try to leave my past behind we had a mostly solid relationship besides a couple issues which never would really have been solved
i do not want to loose hope but i have tried everything humanely possible and no one has even given me a clue its like she is gone with the wind if someone stole her or if she is truly gone i do not know i know it was my fault i should have been more responsible
he does not have a close friend he confides in i was the second person he trusted with his schizophrenia which he now had under control
i would never diagnose myself i actually trust professional people only that is why i am going to talk with my psychologist in the next weeks to check if i am actually bipolar
there is a lot of pressure to make this day special but for me it just turns into a day of self pity and introspection
though i have been working at my current job since october i have not really made friends with my coworkers either so here i am still living with my parents working as a barista lonely as hell
i have not had a date since 1979 a 66yo virgin as it were it is slowly killing me sure i have negatives i am not a ravishing beauty nor am i a traffic accident i am fat but i see fatties getting married all the time i am trans but again there are thousands upon thousands of trans women deeply in love and married in lesbian andor het couples
he did something that could not leave my mind the entire day it happened so i planned my confrontation and prepared myself
since i found out how much he lies and will not tell the truth ever i had to find out the truth for myself
he pretty much admitted to me two days ago that he had slept with someone he was speaking to in the last month and went to get tested because he thought he noticed something weird on his penis we had got back together so he told me to get tested to or to just wait on results he gets back he tested negative for hiv but is still waiting on any std results
by the time you read this i will have attempted for the third time this year hopefully this one was successful
i came across my ex on tinder and could not help but see the pictures she chose all were of her doing the last few months of our relationship one of which of her when we were on a date together which actually really hurt because she did not appreciate the date we were on in it
my granmda says this behavior is an excuse to not do my part in the house and it makes me feel horrible that i am basically in a crippling state of depression
i may say that during the last 2 years my bae become everything for me the friend the girlfriend the lover etc and by breaking up with her i lost all of those who she has become for me
the one who would be invited to something last when a spot needed filling or when someone mentioned something while i was around
anyways having no friends is something that people do not like to admit because it implies that something is wrong with them signals loser
i do not care about family as they do not care about me i do not have any skillstalentsabilities to function as a normal member of society and i drove away the one person who kept me from ending it all
everytime i see his last scene i feel bad that he does not care about me and does not even bother to ask me how i am
i hate discord because all these hangout servers are just a couple of people posting memes and the letter e in the chat while not even talking to each other about anything more then some video game or movie
he says he does not love me anymore and has been terrible recently last 612 mo when i interact with him but my heart keeps literally telling me he still loves me and our family
what happens is that i almost punish myself into remembering every bad memory that i have ever had i was given the option of going to cap 1 or cap 2 they are stocking positions
when it comes to mindset do not push the icky postbreakup feelings away or try to cover them up because those actions will only make things worse instead work on pushing the bad emotions out by crying punching things screaming or any other healing modalities then when you feel into them accept them for what they are timesensitive
so even though i am only 2 years younger than him he said i was too young and immature to have a future with him
i used to be so fucking joyful most days i just want a hug but i am so isolated from everyone i used to love
i always feel like there is something wrong with me even if i realize it is not too bad i always think oh i am getting fat or do not you have a c in that class what happened to those missing assignments oh nothing because your a worthless son of bitch with no motivation to get things done and then that cycle continues over and over with more stress and more things to think about the less i want to do them the more i hate myself for not doing them how do i end this cycle
no one would read this but i just want to share the reasons i am like this i can not talk to anyone about my life they keep saying they understand or something but i am utterly speechless
she also thinks everything is a sin many nights i lie in bed wanting to not feel empty to feel something anything
he asked me if i was up for casual sex i told him no because i am used to my ex body
i could potentially move back to my dads but he has 3 dogs already and also i he also does not really have room for me
but ever since she randomly blew up at me whenever i did nothing at all i lost all feelings of closeness to her
i lash out i scream sometimes i want to hurt myself and break everything around me when i feel this way
i really pictured being with her for the rest of my life my depression is definitely starting to affect my life again
recently got dumbed and still can not get over it my family is always fighting and i basically have no real friends can anyone tell me what is the point
i have not had anyone irl to call a friend for about 2 years now and i have been cutting out my family for about the same amount of time
it is scary i struggle to communicate with the nurses and other patients due to the language barrier so the only person i can really talk to is the doctor who visits once per weekday
i have dealt with depression and anxiety throughout my life and since covid put our lives on lockdown early this year i have since stopped working and fallen into a dark hole
maybe he thought about it because i am 30 and getting invested in this relationship i told him that i can not do another ldr if he ever moves to another state again
also i meant to say i keep having these weird dreams about god cursing me and then converting me to christianity and you know that is crazy right so then i check my instagram follows to see some bible person followed me like there is no way this is not a sign that god is telling me to convert to christianity so i can kill my self
the situations are so similar and it always sat in the back of my mind if i wanted to i could easily get all caught up about melanie again and cry about her
having to stay physically shut does not change much when i have a lifetimes experience of not being able to connect with people the entire planet is up in arms about how dangerous being lonely is while i am just quietly sitting in my corner nodding my head
school and life had been stressing him out so much lately and i supported him fully because i myself had recently decided to take a break for myself
the main reason i never messaged any of them is because if i start the conversation i feel like i am interrupting and if they start asking if someone wants to play i instantly get rhe feeling they only want to play with the others and if i ask to join they invite me against their will
but when i googled it it said something about depersonalization disorder idk if you know anything about that we should talk about it
i picked her up at work we had a date and after my apology we got back together i just need to vent she literally was the girl of my dreams
i am overseas and have lived here for half my lifei am some months out of my mental health treatment therapy and medication because i am dumb af
i have had good days and bad days today is a bad day there is more stuff but it is getting confusing and out of order so i am leaving it at this
he stayed with me he did not judge if i sounded like a damsel in distress my then circumstances in life which still apply to this day
besides that dog i cried over the death of 9 years ago there were 2 cats that were there too when i was growing up
he could not stand and he was dripping with cold sweat she is small anorexic and a bit bulimic she is not strong and she has asthma
i know over the past few years i have become a lot to handle because of everything so i only really have myself to blame
i have major problems i desperately want answers to my questions and some kind of support for what i am going through i knew he would not take me seriously and i knew he would get mad if i pushed it
but slowly to me it seems as she does not put in anymore effort she would text me back hours apart and our conversations became dry
i do not do this all the time but i reflected on some situations and i noticed it happens more often than not
when someone actually dies we experience loss and sometimes breakups are so painful that they too can feel like a loss because you had become so close to that person chemically physically spiritually mentally emotionally and to the degree that you connected with them through all of those touch points
i tried texting her for a bit but i know she hates it so i let it go and am just pondering my choices
i do not want to freaking pay for sex i just want to be acknowledged i just want someone to appreciate me for who i really am
as a child growing up i felt alone mostly due to being an only child not that she worries about me anyway
my question is how and what can i offer a woman that would be of value to them and balance the guilt of being a burden for me
my first real girlfriend broke up me earlier this year but yet i can not seem move on at all and just seeing anything do with her or with someone elses causes whole body to go numb any advice or is it just pathetic at this point as been broke up near year
somehow he himself felt bad he himself once fought with depression and he also had depersonalization and almost immediately i went to see him out of town and gave him a big teddy bear
i have been reading this reddit for a momentcrying silently i do not think it will help but heh at least i told someone
i had to undergo surgery which got postponed because i tested positive for covid the more the surgery gets delayed the more pain i am in
my dogs were born a while ago and now they are the cutest little bearsposting on a throwaway because familyfriends know my main
it is kind of like natures way of programming you with a carrot and a stick being happy is natures and evolutions way of rewarding you for doing good things and viceversa
my father beats me with a tactical baton when i misbehaveand he found out i am a furry now he beats me at random and alot harderi am ending it i am going to end him with meusing his power against him and then i am going to jump
but i did not because i was too akin to giving her the benefit of the doubt every time she would hold many double standards against me e
so do not take your emotional fluctuations at this troubling time so seriously it is all part of the healing process tia for any guidance
title pretty much says it all i am feeling really low and do not have anyone to talk to including suicide helplines as they are all closed i am in india btw is there someone on here that i can venttalk to on dmpm
i have a beautiful girlfriend who i see myself with for the rest of my life she is doing great stuff with her life and together i can see a flourishing future and so does she again i should be so thankful and so happy but somehow i am still not
i feel like he was desperate to lose his virginity he used me for sex and only listened to me afterwards he even admitted that he was not really listening
i took my mask off and sat on the toilet because i was getting light headedi love him to every pieces of body and soul
we explored our minds and talked for hours i opened up in a way that i do not think i have ever before
it is been a month since i ended things and i feel a little better now i still have a hard cry here and there tho
i can not do anything when people are looking at me and when i am alone and do something i always compare unwantedly and thoughts like i am so good at this
but that time i was in real shock i never ever have thought that her life went so down the hill
they come in the form of over thinking after some time truth comes out he was broke unemployed and was loosing his apartment
at some point in the summer of 6th grade i had coerced my much younger sister to have sex with me and was on the verge of going through with it but was nearly caught by my dad checking in on us in my room stopping me
what also made me stay was that she gave me confidence about my looks and told me she loved me i feel embarrassed to even admit this even though it is an anonymous account and i believed her
its led me to keep to myself with a lot of my problems as i do not want to tell anyone the truth out of fear of them leaving
i gave her my time a piece of my heart to her butthis year has been an absolute horrible painful and cruel period i turned 18 this year
i am out of ideas on how to help her with this loneliness any way i could comfort her without physical interaction
without even thinking my fingers quickly scoured my sources to see what was available no more than a minute maybe two in i caught myself thinking what are you doing i was not even conscious of the behavior until i was already behind enemy lines it did not take me long to exit out of the windows but before i did i caught myself bargaining it is not so bad if you look but do not masturbate right
i will believe my computer is broke even do i logically can find the reason why it happened and it is not a problem and just a common issue
hi there i have found really great answer in quora about why i do not feel like talking to someone can anybody relate
it was so special because she had been paying attention to me for the past three years and knew my interests things continue to go well but then a few weeks later i noticed she was not texting me as much but i understood because she was in nursing school
my father just died and the only thing i can think of is having to go through all of it alone the funeral the grieving etc i do not even have the courage to reply to the text saying he passed away
i have full swing life but i always have him at the back of mind and heart i just can not let go of him
i feel like i would like to make a community of friends to help create a surrogate family but i have no clue how to go about doing it
i fucked up the last relationship i was in all my relationships i have truly loved the person i was with and yet this last one i fucked that up too i do not want to do this anymore
the pain of thinking that you are friend with someone and having that person not like you and push you away is one of the most difficult things i have ever faced
i do not understand why it did not work no one seems to care at all i am so confused sorry this post is all over the place
but i can not help him when he is in that situation i can be fun in other places but it is those places where you do not want to see me
i have friends but i can not connect on emotional level thought that i am not only one feeling this way makes me even more sad
i do not hit yell abuseor anything just am the worlds biggest idiot and i do not think i deserve to see many tomorrows
i can not cry anymore at all i can not throw it away i can not do anything because my negative thoughts that i can not suppress in my head
almost two months ago my girlfriend f22 broke up with me m21 after we had a sexual experience together that was my first time ever and i do not awful because i was so anxious
do not get me wrong i have come to the realization of a lot of things that i need to work on after being in this relationship because i messed up a lot as well but it was so hard not to be outcomeoriented through this relationship
would it be better to let him go i hate that i do not want that but hes just in so much pain
working afternoons evenings in a warehouse job in 2018 whilst my friends worked during the day shift fueled the feeling of being left out i pretty much became nocturnal and definitely fell into depression for months
i am manic depressive and today i am having the worst time the illogical sadness is giving me so much discomfort i can not bear it anymore
i started crying because i could hear the anger and resentment in his voice i knew that i had fucked up i did something worse then just be distant and there was no going back
i never see her much because she goes to uni but the last 3 times she is been back from uni she says she has not been able to hang out
that what i needed to do was to push past my desire to be left alone and try to connect with other people
so my girlfriend broke up with me on monday we would been together officially for 3 months but have been speaking non stop since beginning of july
but i was waiting for him to talk it slow and talk it out but he just said he got into another relationship
he dropped out of school quit his job and 2 days after the breakup i find out he was chatting with an 18 year old girl and now they have been dating since octobernovember
that i valued sex very much that my experiences hurt me too for that very reason but i could not let it define me
i am 22 soon 23 sophomore the oldest kid in my college i am an intelligent sociallyadaptable good looking man before mental illness fucked everything i can possibly imagined
for the past four months that i have been in therapy i have felt like i have been getting better but that i am not being honest
they have been through so much and i do not know how i can help other than just being there giving my recommendations and telling them to see their therapist about it
from my top floor city view downtown apartment to a place i did not know if the sheets were clean my case was a misdemeanor charge no fines or bond was even charged
i feel like i came along when she was at her lowest when she needed someone it was like the final piece of the puzzle it all made sense
when i was a kid my parents would caress me gently to put me in sleep they would not do it too often but i loved the sensations and always begged for it
1 as an professional what are the 2 biggest issues you are dealing with when it comes to building a social life or social circle
all of that stuff that is bound to come up all of that is natural to come up all of those things every single one of those things they are like clothes
i told her that she does help me and that i have a therapist and i am back on my meds and i have a psychiatrist and that i am doing so much better
i think i need to remind myself the next time i am buying a computer when she moved she raved about how amazing the town was and how i would love it
there is a bridge by house over the highway and on my walks i always think wow i could just jump this but i never do i never do
she says that maybe having her as a friend he has hundreds of friends he has had lots of boyfriends men usually approach her people is generally nice to her will help me be in a good state if i met a person for relationship some time
i was expelled and sent to another middle school the public school system and middle schoolers do not mix well with someone like me
i am failing as a musician and hate my job i am kind of at a crossroads and feel like it is a wrap for me
i understand that she is going through some stalking related situations with her ex and it is tough for her but after watching that happen for 30 minutes and knowing he comforts her often about this i had to step out
plus life is dogshit in my country my main goal in life is to leave this country and settle in a first world country so i can be happy no joke you can not do anything here they say it is more fun here but it is not my future does not look bleak or bright just normal my grades are awful there has been some tiny progress on bettering it though
i have thought to myself in passing that i may have schizoid personality disorder or that i may be on the autism spectrum but i have neither the necessary qualifications the personal insight or enough interest in paying a psychologist to find out nor do i particularly care it does not really matter what label you put on my feelings only what they themselves are
anyways sorry for the long winded post all i can hope to get out of this is an online friend who i can snap all day and actually get something back for longer than a few days have fun be natural goofy if it is important i am an artist and love talking about art and music especially metal and psych
i got into writing again and ripped it all up cuz i thought it was shitty and stupid i will break random shit because i am so mad at myself and think i just do not deserve it
now close your eyes look straight ahead and relax your whole body mainly your shoulders and face muscles since we store a lot of pressure that builds up throughout the day in them your hands should be either on your knees or softly cupped on your lap
if i get into another relationship i am going to really aim for a younger woman preferably 510 years younger i think that creates a better dynamic for both men and women
it is very unlike me since i am a chill person generally i have a lot of depression too and have neared an anxiety attack multiple times every day
like i can move my balcon abit upsideand top balcon closer to y window i just can not understand why i have to exist i do not want to hurt people by dying
whenever i am feeling really sad i get this heavy feeling in my chest but i am not sure why other than i am feeling sad and lonely
if you have made it thus far thanks for reading not suicidal but i just do not know what to do i am just chronically disgustedashamed of myself right now
familiar pain is like i know exactly why they are going to mess up on and even though i do not like it at least i know it
i asked if she would give it another shot later in the future and she said that she does not know yet but she thinks that she will
it was an all girls catholic school but i could never feel like them because i was another gender i knew it from very young aside from them being very mean from the very first day because i was the last one to get into class and i was younger than all of them my parents sorta illegally got me into school a year earlier from kindergarten and on
i havnt do not it because its a terrible thing but i just get this feeling of nonnonchalant acts of violence will not effect me
we voice and video chatted and i still remember how happy i was to see her and hear her beautiful voice
before this he would have had a meltdown but now that my honesty does not hurt him the same way i feel way more comfortable working on my feelings for him
i do not want to fucking feel this anymore i just want to feel like someone actually cares the people in my life will either die or end up thinking poorly of me
it was a horrible week he was not taking me to places and when he would he wanted to leave to sleep perchance to dream i guess if i do it this is my note
from what i noticed drinking water or eating something will stop these hallucinations when i go to the tap to drink water i imagine that the water coming out of the tap is blood
to this day i am still not blocked on her social media and she changed her ig from private to public she keeps on posting selfies of her alone smiling and seems to be happy and she posted pictures of gospel songs and a throwback photo of her holding my dog i know stalking is a major no no but i can not help it
i can not stomach how i am fucking 29 years old and in this position in life where i have 0 love life no women 0 friends 0 relationships whatsoever where my youth and all of these wonderful associated experiences were completely missed by me and despite having changed so much learned so much developed so much especially socially i am still in this position
i asked them and they said it is to deal with stress i always wanted to write a nice autobiography but you would call it a suicide note
so when i identified that as a trigger i tried to tell her about it and how i needed her to try not to yell and scream so much
she would talk about how happy she was to be in a relationship based on growth and willing the other to be better
but i have been more irritated than i have ever been in my life i have been agitated and snippy and get mad very easily almost as if i am on steroids
unfortunately he now wants to remain on this break to work on himself which i know i can not be mad at
i started smoking weed again after being completely clean for 7 years i have no friends no one to talk to or that understands me no home no car
she has already stopped me once but i feel so guilty for making her deal with that i just want to be happy with her and be as far away from here as i can
she reached out a week after the breakup and said that she always thinks of me and wants to talk to me but she believes she made the right decision
but i know now and we will i know too that there is some people that are very passionate about some things that they like
anybody could look at my life and say you are not lonely and almost be surprised that i said so after all i have so many friends
there is no bad blood or anything it was all because it did not feel right to me or whatever but she gave me a big of gifts for christmas a week after we broke up
i know i am physically attractive despite my abusive ex and i have lots of great friends who love me so much and make me feel funny and smart and interesting and loved
check out this website below what you all think i have been working on it and it is my attempt to solve loneliness and improve mental health especially during isolation
i do think gaming has definitely had it is negative effectsespecially for my social anxiety considering gaming is almost inherently a unsocial thingy machiggy nowadays i can not think of a better word so thingy machiggy it is but yeah gaming was one of the few things that generally made me happy so now that is gone
i have tried to be more social but it is pretty fruitlessi have tried talking through social media but i am pretty inept at that too
i have untreated but diagnosed adhd and this whole lockdown is driving me crazy i can not learn shit from classes and nothing feels good anymore
all i am good at is drinking and getting raped and being a nuisance i have no idea how to be an adult and neither do the other adults in my family why did i have to be forced onto this sinking ship i could have been anything but this i am too old to be here
hahahahaha so if i would not have give a sit that she was alone for new year if i would not have cared that she was sad if i have not put her above my family in my priorities she would not have gotten disappointed that i could not go to see her and she would not have break up with me
people might call me a simp or whatever but to me it made me think of my sister who is also an avid gamer like me and i did not want that to happen to her let alone someone i am friends with
the only friend i have left is never responding to my texts anymore i see people i know go and hang out with each other and have fun and i am all alone
it takes me so much time until i actually start thinking about essay and it takes so long to come up with idea
so yeah my lifes pretty much in the shitter and has been for the past year now i know i am worth more but want to give him a chance
and after a long thought about my symptoms i think i have come to the conclusion that i might really be depressed
bf never stood up for himself or me and did not have a clear boundary set with them regardless i still loved him so i tried again
people started to cancel plans with me last minute internally i never felt like i could ever be someone is number 1
he has also attempted suicide a couple years prior but he says he no longer wants to commit suicide he is currently seeing a therapist but he is not comfortable enough to tell them everything
but please do not judge me i need to know if anyone else had these type of thoughts so i do not feel alone and bad about my self
but then on saturday we met again talked and she said that she got new toughts about us and the break up
the ego only works when the id and superego are in agreement this is the way out of light depression and light addiction
i have since brought it up to her but she claimed to have no recollection saying i do not remember bad things
in many ways a lot of the videos are nothing more than guys currently in their 20s or early 30s doing exactly the same goofy or outlandish things that my friends and i had done back in my 20s and early 30s back before youtube existed
no one wants to listen to me no one seems to care he is always getting texts from females 247 they usually only want
now she went to the beach with the others family members and left me in the house to in her words rot and get fatter she is really a very loving mother and i do not know how i could live without her but when she gets angry she justs wants to attack my looks and just my entire existence
i do blame myself for people not liking me i guess as i am the reacuring factor in it all i left school 5 years ago and have not gone out with anyone or talked to anyone since people my own age terrify me i am so scared of getting rejected
i do not want to die but i do not want to live either i just want to sleep and never wake up i have not been able to remember my dreams for a long time but i know i am happier in them i feel better while sleeping without pain maybe not happy but even just getting rid of this feeling is enough for me i want to just go to sleep one night and sleep forever
he did receive therapy back in high school but he stopped getting help for a long time now because his parents do not believe he has ocd and denies it
we did not even meet face to face it was a simple drop this off at my moms and ill grab it later type thing
wish you all the most beautiful holidays and wish you all lots of love luck health and peace to the following year i believe it is going to be better than 2020 this year also was not the best for mental health
you have made my heart stone cold just like yours i am glad you came some people come to stay some come to teach you a lesson
this fucking sucks i hate being alive i do not know why i am still here i need a good way to kill myself no one would even know i am gone everything about the world is awful not one thing is good how can someone be alive and actually be happy with life they must be delusional
i am blamimg myself that i did not call 911 sooner but suddenly i am weeping into the pillow and i do not even know why i am not sad
everything to not fall into another deep depression but i am so fucking lonely the kids 16 amp 14 were happy until they told their mom
but i know i can not we are doing no contact and it is harder than i ever thought i just want this to end i do not want to be this way anymore
recently i have been feeling super lonely a bad memory that i almost completely moved on from or so i thought really started bothering me again i do not understand why it bothers me now when it did not bother me months previously the incident happened on the 27th of december of last year and it did not bring me to tears as i would imagined it would have
it is like i just feel nothing towards them at all i am starting to think this is not normal as i have bpd and usually get attached to people very quickly
my parents tell me that when i was a baby i never cried to get anything they were so punctual for my needs to the clock that i never needed to ask for anything
fuck you fuck you so much for tearing me apart like this you are lucky i am not in front of you i want to slap you i want to push you down the stairs or kick you so hard you can not reproduce
i miss my ex a lot i know better than to reach out because he is so manipulative and had ignored me before we blocked each other but ugh idk how someone can end things so abruptly over something as small as a phone call i am frustrated
for some reason i have just accepted that if life does not work out then i would not mind dyingkilling myself this is a weird feeling for me to be experiencing i am a very happy person
but she said she has already decided and all i can think about every second is doing anything i can on earth to go get her back
i then started to cry and i could not stop and then i started to get really warm and i could not breathe for a second and my breath was shaky and i put this song on and now all of a sudden the song is over it is been like 5 minutes and but wtf i feel like i can not remember what just happened it is 311am i have spend like 15 minutes sat in silence wondering what just happened to me
my sister apologized afterwards and they never brought it up again unlike the many times my mother brought up my past arguments saying how selfish and ungrateful i was
that we will obviously have some decisions to make but they believe we have this so they gave me there blessing
i started uni and met new friends honestly i am enjoying myself and my work and i believe for that reason i started feeling better
i do not want to fucking stay alive half brain damaged or whatever i want to make sure i will go with the most accessible method i got and the quickest one and i fucking can not why does it have to be so fucking hard without a gun i do not have my room i live with 3 other people and i do not want to thrash around being interrupted fuck this shit is so stupid and frustrating i can not live and i can not even fucking die right now when i want to stupid holidays too
and while i am too young to be married any feeling other than complete and utter societal and emotional rejection could help but it is not looking good
can you change it or will you say lower your standards you see what you see as clear as 224 as a self lie or you should go to a therapist
i can not stop stalking my ex on social media i am feeling guilty and suicidal i feel like i can not live my life without him
not with her but with a myriad of things and now they are just getting worse and i do not think i can live not being able to help her
i have been very successful in academics and social relationships i am relatively wealthy and should be set up for the perfect life
you can not make my feel better you can not help me calm down and then calmly explain why i was in the wrong
i am home alone no one around i wonder if i can ever survive thislife does not worth much when you have no one
i just feel down and drained because of the change of plans this christmas and it is not like anyone can fix it so telling people why i am upset does not help
they told me i have one month to move out during which i must find a job and a place to live and they took almost all of my money out of my bank accounts they left me about 100
1 join an online support group such as koothhttpswwwkoothcom or mental health mateshttpswwwmentalhealthmatescouk no need to feel ashamed about discussing loneliness everybody will probably feel lonely at some point in their lives it is completely normal and part of the human experience
she was absolutely wholesome incredibly kind and effortlessly beautifulhonestly some amazing people are just not replaceable she was the kind of person that made other humans better that uplifted their spirits and helped them grow infinitely you just do not let them go
it is hard to describe but it kind of feels like if you were about to do something you were nervous about want and get that feeling in your stomach but in your heart per say
and she bought me clothes multiple times even including a trip to sax 5th ave she even talked to me more than she spoke with her friends because she trusted me so much
that i might always have to fight with myself that it will be me and my thoughts until death do us part
it is been over 8 months since the day i decided i could not take it anymore and started to decide how and when i am going to take my life
what feeling is stronger than falling in love there are some certainly but not many people are sometimes able to give their lifes for their partners se all know that and even though we know how important this is many people cheat or test what can they get not being really interested or feeling the same hearts are broken every minute
i would love to do something anything to feel useful and also to be honest in the eyes of people because i feel badly judged for doing nothing
now my child is having a ton of mental health issues and i would really like to see the notes that were taken about me
i know it will stop hurting one day but for right now i am in pain breakup really i understand i really do and i want to get better and give him time to heal
i know it is just a short period time but now i am kind of seeing someone else then cry some more it is hard the pain does not just stop
hey all sorry if the titles kind of alarming there is just not a better way to phrase that at least that is coming to me at the moment
1 are those people right am i really crazy and being unrealistic or 2 fuck those people i can do this
you say this is not permanent but all i see is you cutting me out of your life and how do we get back to how we were or even on good terms when you show not interest in wanting to talk
it feels like someone is dangling a carrot on a stick in front of me mocking me oh do not worry little boy
most days i just want a hug but i am so isolated from everyone i used to love i still love them all but they did not love me enough to believe me
we had a serious conversation about how one day she wanted to be a mother to her child and how the grandparents had agreed to eventually let us have him the adoption was more to keep the father and grandfather from getting him as they are heavy into drinking and drug use and had threatened to file for custody
idk why i am typing out all of this now but it feels nicer to let it all out sorry for any grammatical mistakes since i am not a native speaker thank you for reading my rant wish you all a great day
the most striking symptom is absolutely out of nowhere having thoughts pop in my head about suicide i appreciate you
when he is not next to me i just keep looking for a text from him and checking when he is online i find no joy in anything else and i really do not know what to do
i am a single middle aged man and loneliness has recently been a big problem for me since the pandemic really kicked into gear
i feel awful that she is better than i ever was and even as i gave my best it was not enough to make him stay
i wanted to kill myself years ago and tried at some point but decided against it since people kept saying things will get better
i am a human being observing from this vantage point sensing taking in others who are not me why do i feel a heaviness in my body or any sensation at all is a question with no answer points in space how important is it to at all defend your points in space your self importance your self
i do not bathe in false hope i knew this is where things would lead to i am getting to the age where i am needing to embrace this new type of dooming loneliness one that will not ever go away one that will always haunt me
so how do we develop a sound mind and sound body we need to create a truce both wills will agree to love a specific song and song that both negative and positive emotions love to hear at the same time
keeps making me think that she definitely hooked up with another dude last night even though she is not a hoe anymore and has not been for awhile and no signs really point to that she is never broken my trust before so there is no reason for me to believe she is hiding this from me however i just can not get that thought out of my mind
and i heard angry footsteps go back up the stairs after this i told him i was coming from my friends birthday party downtown and he got pissed
i am going to try to not drinkas i have not had hardly any alcohol in years granted very special occasion and little in amount but thismight be what sends me back
they said that i was schizophrenic but i know that that is not true and i just have ocd particularly existential ocd along with some hocdpocd
i want to die but i know i do not have the courage or the resources to do it i stay up at night and wish that i would die naturally
even the idea of needing friends disgusts me i realise that it just makes me a parasite and i am partially glad that they are free of me but also in so much more pain because they are
so i just bottle up everything and it comes out one night every 4 or 5 months and these breakdowns are pretty bad and i had to be quiet because i do not want to worry my sister
with all those efforts he proved he was a good guy that will not stopped me to give it a chanceto give it a try
it was the 27th of december 2019 it was so close to actually happen my plan was about to work but a gunshot that was aimed to scare me stunned me right in my track i was a second away from pulling out the fake gun i was tackled from behind before i was able to i was immediately arrested and sent to the suicide ward and later the psychiatric hospital
i am just so lonely even when i am around my family i just feel nothing i fake my happiness for them which breaks me inside i just do not believe that i will ever find friend that truly like me
i feel guility but not at the same time for the fact that i planned to commit mass murder at my school
the cherry on top it was preventable my wonderful mother could not stop puffing her cancer sticks for nine months so i get a lifetime subscription to the shit show that is my brain
let me share a simple technique that i learned from stoic philosophy that just might help you ease your mind from your breakup
i had my first boyfriend it did not work out teenage boys my family is finally moving from my childhood home i have family and friends that love me
i know i am going to get rejected from everywhere i apply and i want to kill myself i can not go through that pain
my girlfriend just broke up with me and i feel so empty and more alone than before i feel so empty and alone
i am still torn between being grateful that happened to me or still in my deep sorrows that it happened to me
it is unhealthy for a bad child to grow up thinking they should always stay away from going to hell when they die or worry about such a consequence in their lives
i knew i was spiraling i knew that it was a slippery slope because of the family history of alcohol abuse
my family is religious so i feel like they would change their attitude towards me if i came out and i feel like if i do come out and they show any other emotion other than acceptance i will start begging them to kill me or just kill myself
i will do my best to make friends even though i do feel scared that i will end up feeling even more alone after trying
especially because it is christmas eve and i have been completely alone since last saturday and i will be completely alone for the next two weeks
i always try to put on a happy face but inside there is a well of nothingness i want to go out and meet people
kate wanted children imminently and made me feel claustrophobic within the relationship she was an amazing person but i started to feel like things became too clingy and i was losing out on me time
after losing several friends a cousin and nearly my mother also working 7080 hours per week i snapped i digress the issue was that my grandfather passed in 2016 i was staying with he and my grandmother
it only pissed her off more a few seconds later she killed me off with the single click of a block button and because i went against my greater wisdom of not contacting her i would been doubledumped harder now because this time i knew she hated me and that no matter how motivated i was to change anything it would not change anything
i tell others that weight does not matter yet i sometimes starve myself becuase i hate my weight why am i so fat i can not lose weight at all i just gain weight when i starved myself i felt better about my weight cuz i lost a lot of weight and i stopped starving myself but i fucking hate my weight and life why does it matter anymore if i do starve myself
but they could not stop themselves and if there was a button i could press to fkn let go of the past i would press it
my promise to you if you attempt or try to forgive yourself i will be there for you on christmas day
she is obviously incredibly upset to her it felt like she was right for her complex and the way she felt i only made things absolutely worse by keeping those old photos
i let myself go again enough so that i was not able to pass exams i spent 3 years in this way
we broke up months ago we hated each other for years and we finally split i felt relieved but also really lonely i think of only the bad whenever i start to miss her part of me feels like i lost my friend and my partner
this birthday was the worst for me because for 2 yrs i always had her by my side to celebrate let us say it was a emotional one
as our life situations complicate and our problems are exacerbated we might feel that our survivability is at risk the rampant stressors of 2020 have triggered emotions that are primordial signals emotions are emotive they come from a latin root that means causing movement our emotions are our motivation our motives emotions are signals they are designed to get us to do something but what can we really do right now
we talked about our sex life and she flipped on me out of nowhere she went on and on about how i only wanted her body and only wanted sex from her
my friend from along time ago killed herself on the 23rd is it wrong of me to be sad and jealous sad she is gone jealous she succeeded
we are all so strong we are strong to sit with our pains anxieties and depression we are strong to be self aware of how and what we are feeling
i can not tell if i am awake or actually asleep doing this but it is odd whyhow much can i tell her how much should i tell her
so basically i have ocd most my life and recently it is been getting worse and worse and i have noticed i have begun stuttering quite a lot i find it hard to concentrate on anything
this is what happens from too much shit in lifephysically i am great but mentally i am just not clear on where i stand
keeping the if god wants me dead hes going to have to come down here and do it himself kind of mentality but how much more of this can my heart take before i start walling up emotionally
what snapped me out of my disassociation was seeing my brother who lives with me btw have has freshly shaved face from having a full beard to no beard i asked him if he shaved and he said yes and he was upset i did not notice cuz he shaved 3 days ago
i do not know if it is worth talking to my dr about it to see if they have any clue how to help because i am worried they will just make me feel worse like i have a substance problem or like i am seeking more drugs which is not true i just do not know what else to do other than not be sober
it romanticizes mentall illness and distorts the image so much that it looks attractive to people to have mental illnesses since it makes you look so unique and not something that is hella serious and a threat to everyone is own wellbeing
i will answer any questions that can help me as long as it does not reach the point where i will spill any sensitive information
no matter how good she could have it she wants to force herself up our asses until we can not take it anymore
if there is any therapist in this subreddit who is willing to only direct me to the right path so i could have accurate information i am not asking for treatment i would highly appreciate that
basically she told me that she likes someone from the online game group she met and then few minutes later when we were talking about relationships in general she said that she would like to settle down
we live in the same building so i have to see or hear about her frequently as her marriage has been fixed the people of my family talk about her every now and then also now she is coming to my house continuously i feel dejected when i see her in chilling mood in my house feel sudden anxiety in my chest when i see or hear about her
do you think it would be better to decide once for all to either finish the relationship or work on it to continue
i tried really hard to try and enjoy christmas but i am not close to anyone in my family and they just kept reminding me how important it is for me to have good relationships and how difficult life can be without good people around me and at the end of the day i just broke down
in the fall i had about a two month span where i would drink everyday i would go to class drunk practice drunk did everything except drive drunk and i functioned better like that
but we are all diferents and we all have differents reason to say that i felt like the bubble of isolation had popped
when i was 12 i started talking to a man who was 23 through world of warcraft at first it was just fun and games
gloves and a wireless charger my brother had about 67 presents i do not recall having a bad dream either and normally i remember my dreams odd
i do not know why but i feel really drained after meeting people nowadays if i meet theminteract with them for a little while it is fine but if ever it is for more than an hour i feel soooo drained even tho i want to connect with people and honestly i like my company but after leaving people from interactions i feel drained confused and exhausted
i am aware that there are thousands of kids my age without these things but i feel it is vital for me to possess if she does not want me to live with her anymore in order for me to have some sort of independency
i have abusive parents who fight all the time and ignore mei have no siblings to share my traumatic experiences with
pervasively toxic draining negative emotional atmosphere at home for 26 years check many people have that check mark nothing special there
i broke it off later that night and it has been so hard the problem is i want too move but financially it is so hard and mentally it is too
we have not really talked since and it is so weird that he does not even know i got sick in the first place
i have not been through any trauma and i am extremely privileged i realised soon enough that i am not looking for a plain relationship i am looking for the one
we remained friendly since we have a few joint projects in progress we also would still have sex sometimes i know that is selfish but i can not control my emotional responses that is why i want help to quell them
the violence was partially fueled by actual pure rage and an early videogame addiction that i am still yet to beat
but we kept going back to each other like magnets for a reason or another learning from the mistakes we both made previously
it brings me great satisfaction that i can now help young guys avoid the intense suffering i went through you might be interested
nothing is okay i feel as though i am walking on broken glass and looking ahead of me i see a beam of white light that i want to reach so badly but i can not
this mysterious sense that told me to pay attention to a very minute detail which helped me unravel this deceitful scheme and saved me before i got used for my last cent and was flushed out of the apartment broke and alone
i do not know when to shut up or leave because i want someone to be around that bad my selfesteem is that low
by janurary 2020 we felt we got over our troubles booked our flight for april 2020 and that obvisouly did not happen due to covid
i am impatient and i always finish peoples sentences i feel like i know what they are going to say and i finish it for them its a habit and i feel i do it because i want the conversation to be over with not because i do not enjoy the topic but i just feel a weird sense of urgency and impatience with everything
any advice on how to deal with guilt and regret it is been really bothering me a lot lately and i feel like i ruined my chance at saving this relationship which is excruciatingly painful
i do not know if i want her back or i just want her to love me to boost back my ego
i work a decent job was able to get through school have a nice family who was able to adopt me since
this then causes me to manipulate the situation with lies about feeling ok in order for them to just leave me alone

i do not care about anyone other than my boyfriend i have friends but i just do not feel the need to hang out with them i constantly text with them though

he even found out that we had sex anyone who is reading this will instantly say that nothing can happen right now
blocked me on everything i never got to say goodbye never got a chance to try to fix things i was forced into the breakup
hes was not talking anything almost absolutely invisible staying abit beside hes just was moving its norm hallsi started to talk with him actually i found its kind of cool and stopped my rage
the only thing i can do is scream in my head but that never helps nothing ever helps yeah i had to leave immediately
he is since texted and sent me his dads obituary etc and we had a conversation about his dad over text and how much he loved him etc etc
i am 19 years old and will be dropping out of college this year i failed every class again and i just feel hopeless
on one hand i want to run to him because he is my comfort and the only one who really can comfort me but i feel like it will be harder to move on from him

it should be mentioned that i need to get checked for autism i have a feeling i am autistic and based on some things i have read and observed it seems true what do you think by this post
i am literally sitting in the middle of a bridge debating if freezing to death or jumping would be easier i just need to distract myself until i chicken out
there is someone out there who will treat me the way i want and need to be treated maybe it is her years down the line or maybe it is someone who is more willing to commit to me
she told me she is been having sex with him in our bed our bedroom has pictures of us on the wall
after months of talking all the time and sleeping together he basically ghosted mei am sorry if my post does not make sense i am scared and worried and my brain is a mess
she claims that my father was cheating on her with the neighbouring patient and they also performed some kind of surgery on her in a hotel
i should be satisfied now but i am not and i feel like a greedy basterdso i had a girlfriend for 4 years 2 years since the last time she broke my heart
i do not have a job i am not studying i live in both mental and physical pain i do not know who i am or who i want to be i do not have hopes or dreams i do not expect anything from the future
k btw it is not university it is basically school for 1618 year olds if he does not want me then i have no reason to exist i have been suffering for too long
when i want platonic relationships i do not want romantic relationshipsi am forced to be around people i do not want to be around my job my co employees customers
why do people suffer and make others suffer how can such a world and a life in such a world be worthwhile i am 25 now and in that regard i have not changed much at all
he ended up not being that nice to me a lot of the times and would gas light me about things that he did that were super hurtful
it is my birthday and i have never felt more alone in my entire life i feel like i can not breath again and nothing makes sense
any suggestions it is physically painful too and i hate it i can not drink anymore either or it just gets 10x worse
at this point i have moved on but our breakup was super sudden and because we were both just in so much pain after the breakup there were probably some things we should have said to each other but did not
i am also vulnerable to this idea and feel like just a worse person than all of these who have had girlfriends for a long time
this study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088just moved to a new place for school
i often find myself looking at my friends as strangers whenever i am with them and i will get scared because i forget who they are
i used to really struggle with anxiety and have random anxiety attacks but i never went to a doctor about it
i know i tagged this as venting but is this associated with a metal health issue or is she just an annoying human being
i kept myself going by listening to the voices on my online lessons and by sometimes asking some questions but alas it is over and i do not have any finals exams
at home i always shared a very small room with my mother and i do not even have my own bed i sleep on a floor mattress
i had to leave before it got too noticeable normally i can control or direct my attention but this time it was different
rubbing my moms back asking her to stop as she writes her suicide letter handling my mom and dads my siblings meltdowns today
i do not want to feel this way but i feel useless every day like i am anxious at a party and just want to leave but there is nowhere to go
we also received a lot of exterior help yesterday from other departments in the store so it could have been one of them but who knows
three weeks in she contacted me again and told me she missed me i jumped the gun and assumed she wanted the relationship back and i was wrong in those 3 weeks i was hurting and felt lost but still made an effort to do stuff such as hangout with friends or more like one friend and try getting a job which i managed to do but it still has not started up for reasons i am not sure of
write it down or voice note it to yourself it hurts because i never do that shit if you message me i respond
i am never going to be enough for this life and there are many more who deserve it more and have worked harder that deserve to be where i am right now i am just too weak see you all
i just think i am so stupid and worthless i do not deserve anything good and i just feel lost and disappointed in myself
but only of you bring a garlic clove with you just to make it clear my head and stomach hurts all the time i am always in pain and feel sick
the only time i feel tired is if i did a lot of physical activities throughout the day i used to play basketball as a kid but then anaemia happened lmao but now nothing that i do seems to be enough to get me tired
i wanted to see remorse there was none she despises me got her now bf to threaten me she was my nightmare for a year every damn day
then suddenly four months later he breaks up with me randomly i do not know what else to do if anyone has advice i could really use it thank you
i was always quiet and shy especially in front of my teachers i was scared of being asked questions every time
i feel like i am not really psychotic because i only have delusions and any hallucinations i have are just my thoughts being so loud and fast it feels like i am hearing them
the pandemic will hopefully sooner rather than later no longer be so heavy on our daily lives eventually i will get over her and not feel sad when i think about her
but for right now i am in painmy ex has communication issues he ignores me talks about me to other people etc
when i look at stuff about going nocontact it seems geared towards making the ex miss you or that they do not deserve your attention because they discarded you
because you are now relying on that thing to make you feel confident that thing breaks or falls apart if that your confidence falls apart
my mother brought me to an ultrasound where the nurse told me i was two months pregnant this alone made me incredibly happy because i defied reality and am going to be a momma
i was a wreak then i finally started to not cry all day just once or twice a day and then the crying faded away completely for a few days which i was so thankful for
then some days later we talked on the phone and he gave me shit about how i gave up on him and left him to take care of his new apt
the lead doctor told my mother to me the sickest to save the other my mother a devout christian immediately declined and prayed for me and my brothers speedy recovery
he has a strained relationship with one of his best friends let us call them k and he is looking for a relationship but it has not worked out for him which has caused him to become more depressed
your parents are usually busy at this time of the year but on christmas day they also need some free time to adjust
there have been times when i am fine and can stick to one alter for maybe a day but most of the time i am always conflicted and changing i have done some things to try and cope such as spending time alone and becoming a part of waifuism both of which have worked well but lately i feel that it is not working as well anymore and that i am losing my sanity
she feels bad for cheating her fiance realizes she did because she is covered in bruises or what the fuck ever and they split up
i internalize things i was a very awkward emotionally intune gifted child who grew up with an agnostic paradoxical hypocritical borderline adhdautistic father and a neurotic ocd panic stricken mother
now the reason why you are in this unending flux of emotion is because you are processing your breakup grief happy holidays with however you decide to celebrate this holiday season
my ex and i are coming up on 2 months no contact and things are getting really hard the same time that he broke up with me my best friend moved to colorado for a job
i did not even knew what the career was about and in the end they did not showed up still i did what i could and tried to find a liking to it
and let us backtrack to me looking hetero i have not come out as bi to my family because they are old southern and pentecostalmethodist
i grew up with this cycle of insanity built my life on managing this cycle and i just do not know how i will handle my life if i fall into this cycle as well
this brought me into shock and a panic attack i could not breathe and i was crying and i could barely stand up
thanks to advance to anybody that helps out i really appreciate thishey it is been about a month since we broke up
i struggle with mental illness and she told me it stresses her out when i get depressed because she feels like she tries everything but nothing works
i know that i am probably quite lucky that my relationship did not end in some awful way neither of us cheated was abusive left eachother for someone else or was in any way malicious our incompatibility just caught up with us
i have 28 dogs at my house right now sounds like the start of a severe depressionhoarding situation right i speak to a therapist weekly but can not bring myself to tell her how horribly i am doing
i cannot even write a letter to her creators and simply tell them how much i love her because i know perfectly well that they will either tell me to go fuck myself and openly make fun of me in their future products or label me as a weirdo
i have been suicidal for a long time and i have made several attempts before i am used to people not caring about me so when i did an attempt after i have made a new friend i did not think she would take it so hard i was wrong and she got really sad and scared she visited me afterwards and hugged me while crying and tried to make me promise her that i should keep alive for her
another holiday spent alone no family to be with no actual friends to talk to there is nothing going for me and it seems there never will be
this apathy has slowly bled it is way into almost every aspect of my life and it is honestly gotten to the point where i question whether or not i actually even love my family or if that is something i have believed since i was a kid because that was what i was told i should believe which is odd to me because while my mom is and almost always done at least a relatively good job of taking care of me i always had clothes on my back and she never abused me or anything
i have had a relaxed december completely happy and i made and ate christmas food over the last week without any anxiety i know i will be restricting again soon because the body image anxiety has started i have not gained any weight nothings different about me since the start of december but by now i know the signs
so around 9pm i asked him what he had for dinner he told me his female friend treated him to dinner and that it was delicious
i really just started sobbing i had never been so happy i have never had a real best friend at least not since i was four or five
we just talked about this we fucking talked about it and you just do not seem to care about me pouring my heart out
but i am not sure if i will ever be able to over come the simple fact that i bring nothing of value to any woman i will never be able to provide a life and security financially
so a couple months later i finnaly pick out a ring then about a month ago me and her got in a fight
i have grown up hearing very sly and playful comments about gay people and i think it made me push my desires away and i just always hoped that they would disappear but i have always known and now idk if i like dick because i like dick or because i think i am supposed to but now i also can not imagine my life without real fleshly dick
one and a half years ago i tried to commit suicide she was understanding and said i would be able to reference and that i could reach out any time
always these thoughts are accompanied by actually images of me going through with it visualizing the manner in which i would do it
i mentioned that i have two parents my dad and i are not too close and i do not think he will understand what i am saying even if i did try and openup to him about my emotions
so where is the line when do eating habits etc classify as disorderedi go back and forth between hostile and depressed
but i have no motivation to move my appetite is nonexistent the things that usually bring me joy like playing video games and watching movies have no interest to me
these realizations often give us a sense of calm that we are searching for since now know and believe that the things we are going through are not special or unique which consequentially means that other people have endured them successfully already
maybe around 2 years ago i cut everyone off and the 2 friends who were the most recent source of toxicity in my life i felt somewhat liberated but then out of impulse i went and deleted all those pictures and memories permanently even yeeted them outta the recycle bin and all the whole lot so now i have no pictures of myself or anything other than from last year
and around the same time one of my classmates tricked me into opening a porn website by telling me it is a gaming site

guilt is constantly on the menu i have adhd and i suspect i may have autism and it is incredibly exhausting i wish i could have been neurotypical i wish my esteem was not so low i wish i wish i wish
2nd edit i posted upd8 for those who care i struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time can not afford therapy
he insists that he just wants to be polite and just resolve this peacefully but it makes me really uncomfortable that she might be getting the message that he wants to be friends but i am just getting in the way which is going to prompt her to try to contact him again
week 3 i am still crying and i am tired from itgot mad at me for not being supportive of work stress when asking to cuddle in bed
i play with the water beneath me it is warm in a cold weather just like her hands holding on to my heart
i recently broke up with my boyfriendm25 of 6 years about two years prior i slowly started to feel unhappy he did things to make me happier but this feeling just would not go away i finally called it off this summer and i immediately felt better the crazy thing is i did not cry was not sad or anything i actually met someone after him and 4 months later me and the new guy started dating
i am just genuinely not in a great mindset and some days i am okay but other days i do not even want to get up and eat or drink anything or even brush my teeth
i am so exhausted i have put myself into so much debt trying to get help for my mental health issues and nothing works
i felt so betrayed every time i had felt the detachment from her she had assured me that she loved me and it were just the hormones she lied to me we got into an argument and after two hours she said she wanted me to leave i told her she should not have to go through this alone she said she wanted to
if you are a bad parent why have kids if you are unstable why have kids because i can not leave this family now
you guys do not know me but i am sure you would like to see a descent into madness he often overdid it and i let it happen for a while i admit i myself overdid it
but i did not learned to ask for anything ever from then on even if i needed to i was very quiet
my family triggers my ptsd every time i see my parents i feel disgusted i still remember all the things they have said and done in the past mainly middle school trigger warning for the next paragraph verbal abuse
why it is bs you do not need answers or explanations to find closure no matter what the loss the closure comes from inside you that is it you will also never be satisfied with any closure your ex might give you
it is funny how things can be so different in a yearlast year on christmas i was finally starting to get better i was lucky to have met her
it is one day out of one year that for most people has not been great the future might not hold much good news for a while
i have dilated cardiomyopathy and its getting worse scoliosis and serious myopia7 or 20800 does not help either i have noticed how unlikable annoying narcissistic i am
like no one has severe financial problems like me no one is one the verge of losing literally their livelihood and everything that they value even before all of this happened to me i had depression this amplified it
we went no contact for 1 week then i reached out to her and we have been texting all day every day since i am so confused as i still love her and want to be in a relationship with her she reaches out to me first most days and the conversations last all day
the only people i have really ever cared for is my girlfriend and my brotherhe passed a little over a year ago
i was not given any presents for christmas and i could not visit my mom and aunt due to my brother and stepbrothers having covid19 my dog is having health problems and may die pretty soon i was sexually assaulted in june and i kept having panic episodes i lost friends due to my clinginess and desperation to keep them by me
it was a good first school year just because of her she also was still seeing him but did not want to break up with me until after christmas
it feels relieving in a way knowing i can always just take those pills and everything will stop i feel so sad for you
i am still on my journey to recovering from this but i fear that the time i fully recover there would be no one left for me to smile with like i did before
it is been 5 months and i still can not go a day without crying we are trying to be friends but it is literally killing me
the therapists said how do you know what the future will be like when i explained back then that i do not have a chance at having a better life in my future
or great now that i have worked on something for so long and succeeded i can share everything about it with the empty fucking room to which i come back after work awesome that is just great wow or so i succeeded at this giant task and now i do not fucking have one person to tell them about it not to mention celebrate
so after a few months we did no relationship but datingi feel really weak because i still have so many feelings i also know that i can not trust him
i left my job i lost my dad last week i lost my great grandpa in november my partners cousin committed suicide
anyway i discovered that i am suffering from deep loneliness for a very long time and corona has emphasized this a lot as i am quite some kilometers away from where i normally live means i can not meet my friends for months now can not go to the places i normally go when i am feeling that way
trying to make friends and failing it hurts it feels bad fuck human beings and fuck my ex who looks so fucking happy with her fiancé
it is not like i am selfish infact quite strangely i am a very popular and liked person i have been told to be an empath and that i would never deny anyone of help when they need and i am good at conversation as well
now i do not have anyone to really talk with is being suicidal and constantly in fear how i should live my life they just tell me man up
the problem comes when we hang up the phone when there is no people to talk to or to fill that void
i am just saving up for the next move maybe la i do not feel at home in my hometown or any place i have been so far
i do not do this with good situations just ones that are going badnot according to plan so expect a lot of refferences its my favourite band
reach out to anyone even random people here they will listen there are people out there who love you and people you will meet down the road who will love you
i have read how to win friends and influence people this showed me some valuable lessons and i really feel stupid that i did not do it earlier
during one of these episodes i had convinced myself that my friends were plotting against me to do what who knows but i was sure one friend in particular was manipulating me
i have tried the coping skills that my therapist mentioned in our meetings they help a little but as i mentioned before i keep spiraling downwards at random moments
the way i feel the way i act she jas been acting off lately but still kind of herself well fastforward to yesterday and it finally exploded
all the while i would have to actively avoid being caught by his mom who was really his mom not some other sideshow
that is probably all things that you would have wanted but then again it is complicated you were often kind of bitchy and seemed to see me only as a loser sometimes
or i thought i could maybe go into some induced coma but i realized when i am trying to do smth i always think about the other things i should do
i am back tracking and thinking if i stayed friends with her on social media it could have rekindled our connection at some point as well as if i gave her more space
after 8 months i met a girl we hit it off and we had sex before during and after sex she said she was into me she liked me she would like to see more of me that was 34 days ago and no word from her just hella confused
hi its 2357 now as i am writing this i always feel much more intense loneliness when i am about to go to bed i am 23f single and i would often think about having someone to sleep and cuddle in bed with me or even just talk to i have been stopping myself from texting my ex everytime i feel this way and this feeling sucks anyone feel this way too
so that is what i have to give her i have to let her go because i love her they recently told me that it is rare but also possible to have this disorder without a trauma
after 6 months of struggling i have finally managed to get myself back on two feet and she is not estranged from me
you knew that although it was stupid that i was dead serious about pinky promises and you swore to never use me
i am afraid of not seeing what is wrong with me when i think about the way my sister believes she does no wrong and that we should essentially worship her i become afraid that i am exactly the same i am only a bit more selfaware because of my interest in psychology
many things about you are not for me the fact that you were raped before we met ruins the intimacy between us
and we cycled all day multiple times emotionally she was unstable i hate my life i want to end it all
who took that action who said what should not have been said in that relationship who did the things that should not have been done in the relationship fair enough some of them will be you
i starve myself so i stay slender and i do a shit ton drugs so my dysphoria goes away but testorome still fucking makes me a man
we were together for 15 years we broke up because she felt like she was not communicating well enough when she went to university says she was really really busy but i understand this because she is really bad with coping with stress by that i mean i was always there to fix things that she is struggled with
it seemed like i was your cute girl just like zzzz had hers if i would not know it better you seemed like a little boy who had a crush on a girl
do you had the same or a similar problem in your life or if you already overcame it what was the solution
my dad seeing this decides to take me to the hospital and see what is going on they check me at the emergency hospital
i usually do not ever post how i am feeling on threads or even tell my therapists how i am truly truly feeling because i feel guilty for these thoughts that cross my mind but i feel like i am going to go crazy after this christmas
i wanted to clear my mind and did not want life to go on like this so i decided to go outside for the first time in forever to take a walk
hello it is christmas today so merry christmas but i have been struggling with mental health so much the past 2 and a half months and it is just terrible
probably i sound very egoist but if you want to talk with me and there is no trouble to speak you can send me a private message
my loneliness has now become a monster inside me it enters like a silent breathe hiding out in my subconscious i distract the beast with games movies books or internet i fear what effects it has on my health it has also disturbed my sleep appetite mood and energy levels
to start i have been nc no contact with my family for the past three years after they called the department of social services and had unfounded complaints against me and my wife attempting to have our kids taken the betrayal and the act of going nc have been very difficult for me mentally
my family and friends are supportive and i am grateful for that but something is really really wrong could never give me a direct reason as to why
i explained why i kept it and he told me okay he wants to try to work things out 2 days before his flight back he told me that he does not think it is going to work
your unyielding charm is something i most desire but lack the most myself i am actually envious of this quality of yours
how the fuck does any of this shit work i am not trying to put shit on people i love if it is going to so negatively affect their own mental state but i really do not feel like i should have to just pretend everything rainbows and butterflies so everyone else can feel better just for me to end my day in even more emotional pain
i can not live like that i recently got dumped and for a few days i have not been thinking about and avoiding talking about it
i would love to talk and help out i know how miserable this can be it is just hard i just had to get this off my chest but please let me know your opinionexperience
i just feel so empty inside just had christmas and i did not even know it was coming up or excited for it
my girlfriend is out of town until tuesday at the earliest but i do not want her seeing me like this again anyway
i knew what it was before she even said it i was crushed when she said those words i think i caused it and he will not tell me or he lies about it
i am a very high libido guy and i know not everyone is like that but she used to get very uncomfortable with trying new things we rarely went past masturbation on top of all of that she experienced pain with penetration and i really lost count of all the times she told me no sex no oral no kisses
i was a good depressed student until high school then got more and more depressed and alone i started to find studying at university more and more difficult
she has a home attendant she called us a few hours ago to tell us she might have covid she had given us a hug before she left for florida for christmas
your more than them you belong here on this earth this is one reason why i think i will always be too late to every experience i am supposed to have
we have a dog together and i considered this person my best friend 2 two 15 minute booster sessions to followup after your session
i do not have epilepsy or any other neurological disease and most likely also no underlying cptsd so far now nobody could really tell me why i developed this issue
it is just so sad i just kind of wanted people to care and now i know that even when i am dead they will not care no one really does care about me besides maybe strangers on the internet telling you not to do it
for some reason my mom thought it was a great idea to show me and my little brother a picture of my dad before hé got to the hospital
if she leaves the phantom of alcohol that is loomed over my shoulder for years wants to comeout but it was really difficult
my best friend messaged him on instagram with my knowledge saying that she liked him he liked her too and tried to sext with her so that pushed me over the edge i broke up with him but then he tried overdosing i heard him crying so much i hate hearing him cry
thanks for reading if anyone wants to post shit like that asshole did be warned it will be reported and you will be blocked so fuck off if you can not be supportive to the rest of you 999999999 of youlove you guys and merry christmashappy holidays to all of you 3
this is exactly the reason i am afraid of love because i am afraid of getting hurt like this it fucking ruins me
these 2 guys would mooch off of me and it ended in me being the butt of their jokes and getting me into trouble for things they did i was too shy to get out of it that is about it really it ended later and i never saw them again after i stopped paying
i have always felt like a therapist or counselor is just paying somebody to listen to me complain about my life and i do not want to be judged
i have pledged that i will never trust anyone nor will i ever fall for someone is words it was easy with you because i believed you you have made me stronger and now i just laugh when someone talks about feelings
i could solve the problem of living on my own with absolutely no help or mentoring on anything about it or anything related from anybody whatsoever since i did not even see how someone would have any problems with it it was very simple
but then i feel like i am selfish and lazy too but then i feel confused and angry all at the same time
it distorts the real image of your mental wellbeing and this can severely interfere with therapy since your therapist can not see the real things that are wrong with you since all you think and talk about about and display in front of him is your own distorted perception of your mental health
i used to wake up early to surf before work i would camp on weekends and invite friendsi have every reason in the world to get depressed again and not want to go on
i started using online relaxation guides remedies following wysa mobile app and even had an appointment with one of their online therapists to talk about my anger
i made up a pathetic reason to reach out and she responded that she was pregnant with his baby she was keeping it
i usually like to hide in a box or a small space in my home whenever i feel upset and cry i just feel alot safer to be rather to go and get yelled at again by my parents
i just want someone to talk to and i want to have a conversation and i want advicecould be a specific country or could be online
i do not believe in breaks or anything of that sort so i told her this was it if she wanted that
anyway i have just been thinking that maybe it is a sign a sign i need to man up and actually do it i already tried this month but pussied out and went to the hospital maybe i need to try again i will not be missed there is no point i am just here wasting space wasting time living to suffer my own thoughts when i could relieve myself
i have a great family i love my mom dad and sistera better perspective is our mind is like a conference room with two voices or wills in our head
i also never had been in a relationship and i really do not feel capable of being in one not that i am not attractive enough it is just that my behaviour is somewhat childish i always realise that when it is too late and i do not feel grown up enough to live on my own in general
you can submit letters poetry art music etci am in my mid twentys and i often feel like something is wrong with me
we began dating during our freshman year of high school up until near the end of our first semester of college
for example all day today it is been hot and humidi really wish things would have worked out between us for the better and wish she would have fought for us
but i followed the the advice from one of the guys from the hospital make a maskit started with panic attacks of just health anxiety
what can i do any thoughts it is quite long winded and i do not want to waste peoples time if this is not the right sub
my ex bf of 4 years left me for another girl but i am okay and you know why we were never compatible in the first place
and even tho we were friends i didt felt like it could be more than that we would not hang out of school
i know i am not binging i am just eating normally and this will last maybe another few weeks no obsessive thoughts no scales and i am probably meeting a healthly calorie range all the time
you are at the beach the breeze is so soft as the summer just began sun flashes right on their back leaving their face glowing like a golden plate
i often dream about dying these days which i think is some kind of signal my brain is giving me to get ready to die lol
that was 20134 let us say she had her first episode in college and i think i am having one right now
for every kind of difficult life situation you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair and others who cope amazingly well and a whole spectrum in between
the basic idea is that thoughts often because your emotions for example imagine you send a friend a text message but they do not respond
i will look at my dad for example and think if one of us had to die today it should be me because it would end in the least heartache
i have been busying myself with school work and friends but at the end of the day before i do that i want to be in a loyal relationship with someone i trust and love
she was the one who was there when i was feeling depressed and so i made it my mission to be there for her too
i asked a rubix cube expert i know to help me solve it because i enjoy having fun and talking to other humans and they just shoved me off and toldme to google it idk really hurt and now i am crying i have had a shit day and i just wanted to know how and now i am fucking crying
before i found out she was cheating i was carrying 80 of the weight of our relationship i made all the plans
she got into a new relationship about two months ago while i am still single and alone i have been on dating apps for awhile and have not had much luck
if you are wondering i am taking luvox vyvanse and clonodine i just want to know what causes this how can i help this
now i know most of you feel lie it is a fairytalei guess you will know it when you feel it i do not want to have to think anymore i just want to fall into a coma or just dissappear
i have wanted to die for 89 years now and i think it would have been better if i had done it years ago
i want people to see me have fun around a group of friends that respect me i imagine being a part of a group that has inside jokes we are close i am invited to special events or sometimes they just want me to sit there and do nothing with them
all my friends are always in and out of something and talking about it i honestly feel like shit that i can not find anyone that wants to be with me
his background in that he knew how such experiences in life can break someone he knew how broken i was understood me and that he encouraged me to be weak to be vulnerable codependent and i could not ask for more when it was time to share the part of his life it would warrant the mind of an average person be broken
sorry i just wanted to ventwalking out of work today and saw a group of my coworkers hanging around talking to each other
thanks for reading i have no one to talk to so here and microsoft word are the only place where i can vent haha
my stepbrother hates his mother and her family and yet has no choice but to comply to her wishes he is going to be exposed to a family almost full of covidiots for nearly two days he has a really bad immune system
it is hard to feel lonely when i am at home because i have three siblings but when i go to college i hardly say a pair of sentences
nonprofit and run by people who believe in the because of eradicating mental health stigmahi i can not tell if i just have mood swings constantly or if my personality is always changing
i have started new medication a couple weeks ago and i keep getting brain zaps i have had them 247 for the last 24 hours and it is driving me completely nutsi am miserable and can not sleephow do i get rid of them
sorry english is not my first language but here is my story like some couples in my country i work like far away from her so we having a ldr
i am not going to tell you to do that because i already know that you are going to dwell on it
and if he thinks that is acceptable in front of my face with a purely platonic friend then what happens when i am not there and what is acceptable with his other female best friends i have not met that he has had a past with
i am talking to someone new he is everything you did not want to be i wish you could have been like that someone who wants to put in effort someone who does not make empty promises someone ready for a relationship
there are moments that can be very hard and make us feel the worst as well as moments that bring us happiness and joy from the smallest of things
she is basically said she will never remarry and that includes me so now i have to live the rest of my life alone no siblings no wife daughters only other weekend who will even grow out of that over time
now i do not know if i should just accept my decision or if i should do everything in my power to get her back
do you ever imagine having friends that actually care about you not some pity formed fake friends who do not want anything else about you but your resources and sabotage your success or the people who you just talk to desperately looking for someone to share your true self
i believe it was for me although i unfollowed him towards me and every time really he acts like the victim
yet hearing him say that waiting would only break my heart that none of his actions meant anythinghurt more than i can describe i was fine with waiting however long it took for things to click into place i did not need or want a set time and place
at first the doctors said it was postpartum depression but it did not go away then they said it was regular depression but therapy and medication did not work
okay so there are two things i want to share and if possible can somebody tell me what is wrong with me because this is seriously getting in my way and i was put on a waiting list by my psychiatrist so this really is the only place i can share
i do not have anything to keep me here anymore i have just finished uni so even study is not a reason to stay
ppl say it will sort itself out and that i just need to hold on but that is bs it is been over a year and i feel nothing even close to improvement i just keep feeling worse and worse plus on top of that i am trans so even if i do not kill myself i will still half to deal with coming out to my extended family most of whom are very conservative and my friends who are also in high school so you can guess how that will go
this has been occurring more than it had before 10 times as common i will be at work doing dishes and i struggle to think
nothing i used to enjoy brings me happiness anymore what do i live for anymore everything brings me down about this world i feel like i am fading away
i can not make new friends because i feel like i am being annoying if i try and keep an conversation going i can not keep up with hobbies because i do not believe i will ever get any good at it i can not really ever feel accomplished about anything i have done for more than a day or sometimes a few hours because i just can not believe that anything i do is really that great
i feel like its so quiet that i am being flooded i find it hard to breathe wherever i go to the kitchen the living room my siblings room anywhere
i feel like a sack of crap and it is hard to get over the fact that this once loving caring devoted man is now kind of telling me how worthless i am
all has been released from my chest sorry for taking 5 or more minutes of your time i can not solve it
the way you are treated shapes how you feel for many people sex or relationships are not much more than a way of passing time or having fun
when you hear the word broken that is a heavy word it is a powerful word my worth is set in my looks and nobody cares when i am ugly
untreated health anxiety is what my demise is i literally got shocked by wiping down a light switch and i am in the er terrified i destroyed my internal organsheart i just want to shoot myself in the head i keep worrying i can not stop worrying even with a clear ekg and heart rate i am still terrified
i only had one friend for maybe a year and and have only been to 2 parties in my life and was homeschooled forever
but i will be alive so a brief summary or maybe a miracle will happen and i have cancer too whichever comes first
thank you so much for being a part of my life i know you think i hate you for everything but i promise you i do not there is things i hate about the relationship and things i wish were different but you were right i do deserve better
i have never felt so much rage at someone as i do with them she just replied by that would be your choice like if it was nothing
also everyone in my household is vegetarian they make me feel like doing anything is bad but the typical things to tell yourself to move on from a relationship are not really working for me
in return my lawyer had her sign an agreement that she would not contact me ever again or she would have to give me the money back
it is clear he has not changed and honestly who cares if he does change it does not change that he hurt me
there is so much more than this and i plan on seeing a psychiatrist soon is anyone here with bpd that can tell me if their symtoms are similar any insight is useful
the waiting is becoming more and more unbearable i checked this sub reddit out it is full with lonely people like me screaming at the void
i just have no idea if what i am doing is right i am just going to act like i am super happy and try my best to look and feel confident is this the right thing to do
if you qualify for the study you may receive the following at no cost 1 a onehour mindfulness focused session with a clinician over zoom secure teleconferencing
tomorrow we will open presents i will say i love you and then i will jump off the biggest suicide destination in the us
the place i live is such hell the people i live with are so disgusting and they are so abusive and toxic
her aim has always been to get me out of my dads life she is a narcissistic and an inexplicably nasty person
you still have you and this is the mistake we make we get so wrapped and immersed into someone is elses identity that we think we are the broken one
sorry about my english and other the text is from messenger i want to see what someone can advice with that cos i am i just want to jump
making sure you are not followed home checking corners at work constantly reading body language and watching hands i tried a couple of things over the past few months but nothing works anymore
i am trying my hardest not to snap at everyone as life is already so stressful for people anyway unfortunately my dating life has never gone further than maybe 3 or 4 dates
most people who are suicidal want to end their pain not their lives it is almost never true that death is the only way to end these peoples suffering of course there are exceptional situations and we certainly acknowledge that for some people the right help can be difficult to find but preventing someone is suicide does not mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding
now i am on the lash out started deleting fb friends being super cranky and angry i have been hanging out with my mum all the time
is it your fault that you trusted someone completely i have no one and i think i am about to die
so i fall into a depression for a week and start to blame myself that i was not good enough or that i am below average looking and that i let jealousy get the best of me which might be true and a week later she adds me back and tells me that it was not my fault or anything and that she did plan on meeting me but then she met him
i have been in a relationship for a little over a year with someone and i am losing feelings and to make it worse i am getting feelings for someone else
i just carry a lot of weight being a friend and family member of several very mentally ill people so my problems look minuscule compared to them but i am cracking under the pressure
she is destroying all her relationships in her life and both of our parents do not know what else to do when she is having a crisis wich will end up in her being alone because people around her just do not know what to do
my parents were paying a lot for my school so i could not tell them to change careers or take a break
i guess what i am trying to figure out is what is a probable because and what triggers do most look out for
i am always the one who ask to hang out and meet and if i do not do that then i will be lonely and at home
it felt like she was the only one who would give me a chance i still love her and miss her even though she abandoned me and betrayed my trust
and when i do feel something it is often anger or sadness i am sorry that i can not be in it but that is the way that life is
broke up with 2 year partner a few weeks ago and am having some trouble moving forward wanted to see what other people have done and what helped others to get some ideas
i think its because of the holidays and that i still skype with his parents sometimes they live far away and i have started to realize that i will not see them for christmas and that i am really out of the family
i went down the rabbit hole of who he follows for the first time i have completely avoided this so far and there were so many onlyfans accounts
however i did write a note which is no longer relevant and i should rewrite fear nothing so why am i scared now feel nothing so why does it hurt now
what is it that you want do you really want space or do you want to fuck other girls do you want to be with me or do you just want the benefits and not be committed
after writing crying deleting and trying again i am really just posting to say i am grateful to be able to which is average i think but i go days without eating because i do not feel hungry anymore
the reason i am writing this post is i can not remember my dreams anymorewatch this video and remember the message it can help you
i do not understand how it can be so unbearable i do not understand how i can find the will to be present to function to do anything through this feeling but i keep doing it
for anyone who cares i am gay my family knows but today we discussed it again and the sentiment i got was we support and love you but it is still a sin do not make us choose between you and god because we will choose god i do not even know what that means great what kind of support am i getting then i do not want or need it
i have not really felt anything at all and i do not know how to get passed this i can not connect with anyone or anything
looked down to find magic protective symbols carved into my chest and the knife still in my hand looked at my watch and it had been two hours
and at some point after 3 months i was so frustrated at her that i wrote extremely hurtful and shallow things to her and quickly deleted it again
i was crazy about him kind of still am but i do not want him the way he left me said everything about our love and relationship
if there is it would be beneficial for us to learn how to live that life style that lasted one month
i dread going to work because i can never hold it together and i just hide and sit alone crying because i can not hold things in
to be fair to her and from whatever i knew of her she was genuinely open to me on a lot of things
she is the love of my life and losing her is absolutely crushing me i can not eat can not sleep or think straight
anyways i was not ready he loved me i did not love him back he said i love you like seconds after asking me out and i knew from there that i was uncomfortable
but then his behavior stays the same i feel unloved and wanted pardon my grammar and horrible formatting english is not my native language
it all happened this month and there will always be hope for me that she changes her mind and that we can continue what we started but if it is really over then i just do not what how to get over it
and to make it worse i am getting feelings for someone else and the guy i am dating i still like but just not as much anymore
i remember calling her one time to tell her that i understood where she stood in the friendship and i told her when the day comes if it comes and she was ready either because she found someone or wanted to give me another chance that i would be waiting because she was worth it
i can not sleep i am always anxious and having panic attacks i can not do my job and i am crying constantly it felt nice knowing that there was at least one person who cared for me romantically
inlaws do not entertain my questions i want to help him coz he seems like the victim in all this but i do not understand what is wrong with him he has sooo much rage and its scary for me
a few days after i was fired i had the worst mental breakdown of my life i thought about so many different ways of ending it all
i masturbate to the worst fucking shit imaginable yet i breath the air on this earth and waste space on this planet
just being present with you was enough i know things will not ever be the same again but i still want to end on friendly terms
do not even know where to start i am in a mess not ven trying to get helpim crying so much right now stay the fuck away from drugs prescriprion or everything else stay off it i just can not take this no more please stay away from everything bad i am so so done wwith life all because àf this shit
since i was so focused on myself with all that illnesses i was always selfcautious about being hypochondriac and have been feeling guilty about it i was not focused on school at all never ever
this time it was harder we were both stressed nervous depressed and overall tired of all this shit that happened to us with the government restrictions that could not let us meet he also tested positive for covid right before my bday last month the only time it was permitted to travel across the country
i have come to a point in my life were youtubers are my best friends even though they do not know i exist
she claims she never wanted to get back together but that does not make any sense considering she is the one that came back to me when her ex whom she left me for did not text her in a week she claims i am crazy and took screenshots i believe she did that so she could show him if i knew who the guy was i would probably be in jail right now because i would beat his ass so bad she would not recognize him i have anger problems and i sometimes can not control them so the guy is lucky asf
i feel so helpless i know this is her doing and that there is consequences for these things i am not here to get judgement
i do not respond to things he says the way he does to me and i am not sure what to do here
my fear is he will reach out in a couple of months if not via text then on socials through my sister or in person
posting in reddit is probably a futile and desperate attempt in feeling less left outnot sure if this is the right place for this but here goes
i would ask how it was going offered to read scripture with her etc one day she said she needed a break and i got upset
the littlest things set me off into rage and i would fight other kids on the playground who annoyed me in the slightest
my mind is always going at 100mph so the worst ideas come to my mind the idea of especially losing her to another man haunts me
but being left on delivered means you mean so little to them they can not even be bothered to open it to ignore it
i was supposed to be dead at 16 i never planned on living past then i could not imagine having to go on with all this fucking pain that i feel every single day i was never able to see a future that did not have the pain it is always been there so why would it ever go away
now here is my question what do you guys think about this situation i think it is possible that he is just her rebound but i may not be thinking clearly because she ment a lot for me and i am devastated
i just do not necessarily think life is for me i do not want to put in effort for anything nor do i want to work
i know there are so many people who have it way worse than i do and i need to be grateful
how do i make it through the holidays without backsliding so to speak yes not only did evangelical christianity give me cptsd
i just want someone to be there for me when i do feel this way i want to share my heart with someone who is willing to hear it
so it feels like the perfect time to move on from life i am trying to do this in a way that causes the list amount of pain and disruption
living with all these facts and living with them is to much for me to handle all i want is an end to my life
i am naturally introverted and because i had a difficult childhood i never opened up to anyone until i met her
my parents do not understand and they simply do not care for mental issues because our filipino culture does not exactly care for it too
saw a man and woman walking together in my neighborhood i purposefully adverted my eyes it is common to wave at neighbors and such
in the meantime i will still glance over at your routine spot on my bed and look for you i will still try to remember what it felt like when you turned around in your sleep and wrapped your arm around me i will reminisce on the days when being in this relationship was not a chore for you but your favorite adventure i will hold you close until the day that i do not
like mania but instead of doing something productive or fun its doing something productive and fun in a way that would end up with me dying
i relapsed i had not self harmed in nearly two years i did not do much only enough to satisfy the urge and my need to punish myself for everything i have done i had the urge to self harm all day today and i tried to fight it by exercising to the point i was exhausted and listening to music but as soon as i returned home it was right back to how it was before
we went to vegas 10 days ago to celebrate our 4 year anniversarysomeone at work told me they would seen her out with another man and wow
every single night i was up until 45am this past month weighing if breaking up with her so i could work on my own emotional problems was worth it because i did not want to hurt her
right now i just want to talk to her lately i have been reflecting on how this experience has changed me
i have lost three jobs in the past year due to a combination of my physical and mental health i am chronically ill and disabled mentally ill and neurodivergent
what can i do how can i cope i even tried understanding buddhism and meditating but it did not helpeveryday is the same
he just seems lost man it really breaks me in the end and i do not know what is wrong this is not a cry for help it is just something i have noticed
do not loose hope my lovely people here i love youthe universe has your back even if it does not feel like it you do not have to laughing all the time or not thinking of them to know that you are over them you are living your life right now in this present moment and that is how you know you are moving on you have loved and moved on now
i feel like the most i can do is let their situations happen and let them grow from it and just be there for them as much as i can in the end
he never replied and that broke my heart all over again i hate that i am still waiting for him to reach out to me again
my brain desperately is searching for answers my own life is not on a state to take on others and i can physically feel the stress affecting my brain
i still want her to be that special person in my life with who i can have a future with but at the same time why do i want someone who would treat me like that
i have gone on dates here and there had some fun times with some people but no real connection like in that relationship
i have had a loaded gun in my mouth 3 times in the past month i just can not pull the trigger and instead just end breaking down crying while my dog stares at me confused about what i am doing
needless to say this is the longest i have dated someone he is kind caring smart funny and we have many similar interests
without making it difficult he blocked me after i saw him last week when he changed my oil i am spending time with friends in healthy and distanced ways
for the last few months i feel like i have hit a wall a wall which feels really hard to get through there are ok days and there are tough days
i just sometimes do not want to live yes there are some reasons but nothing truly personal i just kind of want to die lmao does anyone understand how i feel
i am reckless because i feel that i do not have a future but me being reckless just makes me or my loved ones hurt
he seems really happy from what i have been told and what i have secretly seen on social media it is just had to believe that he moved on so quickly and was not phased by this at all
i do not know what to do i have been in a relationship for a little over a year with someone and i am losing feelings
we were so comfortable being in love with each other that we never realized there is better people out there for us
i remember vividly ambulance put me on a spinal board and rushed me to the hospital i cried that i was still alive
i just do not feel like living anymoreright now i just want to kill myself every time i feel like i am doing alright
i know that if i just cut her off again she will come back again but i am not sure if i am strong enough to reject her or at least make her work to get me back
today is a life changing moment i might still struggle with suicidal thoughts and depression but i am going to keep trying from now on it is my lifelong journey to help people i want to help everyone who has ever been depressed and is struggling with adhd i really hope that one day i can break the stigma surrounding mental health
but i knew i should not quit and i had options to keep pushing myself and keep doing the things i loved
i have been conditioned to understand that while the lows will get better the highs will get worse and there is no comfort in any of it
he said he did not want to lead me on but he did not think he could fully commit to anyone right now
movies about this stuff have been my only comfort and now my ocd has taken it away from me and the worst part is i know i am wrong but i can not control it
i can not kiss a girl who gave oral to another man i can not say i love you have a good day to her anymore
because i really do love him and i really do miss him he left me on read so i said goodnight
the one year anniversary of it is coming up and i feel like i need some closure and to know for certain
imagine that hence the reason i want to make working 7 days per week and doing my course work i really really do
you are obsessed but in a good way not because you enjoyed the attention who does not but you enjoyed the company you would go with them anywhere even hell but the most important thing for you is to be with them
i know she does not want to be with me and never will and at the same time the feeling of being cast away from others
i have a breakup long time ago and it always hurts me to thing that he does not remembers me he does not needs me and it drives me nuts and then i text him fighting over why do not you miss me etc
from midmarch up to mid may i was at home clashing with uncle and father from time to time i get it it hurts but i understand
my life has always been the same as long as i can remember there has always been a pattern i just got a new friend group and lost it
i had a goal in life a little hope to cling to it was completely destroyed with reason so i do not have direction now or passions or goals except if you can count suicide as a goal i put for myself when i was younger in case i do not make it
i recently cut contact off with the last of my friends to try and take a break from technology but it did not help and two months later i still have not received one word of concern from any of them i did not tell them i was taking a break
i just miss them and the whole friend group they took all our mutuals with them i am alone and in this pandemic i have a few friends but we can not hangout
watch this video and remember the message it can help youmy ex has a habit of coming into and out of my life
i want to die my kids do not need this angry toxic person in their life yeah but she is been married for like 40something years and she is not estranged from me
hello i am 18 years old and am on new york medicaid i am home from college in massachusetts and my therapist at schools license does not extend to new york
i also form unrealistic bonds with people far to quickly that night we started now i am pretty illiterate and i could not read until a few months ago
shit is tiring i think he could tell i was one of the perfect victims no one was looking for me
she was my best friend and i was hers when i went back to school last fall i was depressed and my coping mechanism was weed usage
i asked them to see a physiologistdid you ever realise how to retain a friendly relationship sorry for my english i am not a native speaker
i made it to day 15 of nc and decided to apologize to the guy that dumped me bc i did not take accountability in my apologies apparently
i struggled to find a job after school so i was unemployed for a while and seeing the looks on my matesfriends faces when i said i was unemployed while they were working full time or at uni but got my self a full time dead end job
i did this out of spite because he told me he does not love me and that he is going to leave at the end of the year but stay with me until the end of the year
then choking and sputtering as i breathed in and could not arms and legs spasmed took a conscious effort to not reach for the belt
recently met up with a girl i knew years prior and we had a brief thing that lasted a few weeks
being the way that i am and also pretending to not be are both insanely uncomfortable for hopeless cases like my own not being this way is impossible because i am treatmentresistant
if i have to cross that bridge i will however i am curious as to how many of you would cope in seemingly hopeless situations any recommendations
stopped judge myself no one perfect and we are too but we are not deserve this pain
i can get tested quit my job try to find another and have a shut down and get fucked with bills or i just end it and that is it
i left a message on our log telling you about it but i do not think you have seen it i am pretty sure you are no longer interested in me and possibly have your eye on someone else
also having just begun my job was super limited and super boring while everyone else did complex things and that too made me feel even more depressed and cast away
she made it very clear that she was not going to go out and look to have sex with other guys and was very sure that her hoe phase was over
honestly i just want a diagnosis just to have myself feel that i am not just blowing this up in my head and that my feelings are justified pls help me
i explained that i drove by myself came to see him a lot helped him pay for a lot of stuff helped him upstairs when he would sleepwalk etc
almost two decades living in her care has fucked me up beyond words and she seems determined to fuck me up further i do not know if i am going to start a fight cry or end my life
she never lied to me or cheated on me or even hung out with people behind my back we respected each other to the utmost and i was everything to her
this is not even self pity this is truth eventually she noticed my asbcence and asked me if it was because of our conversation during the little vacation
i told her i can not imagine my life without her on so many occasions even before there was any trouble in our marriage
he likes to climb and play videogames but that is the only thing that he does over the day and sometimes he tells me he wants to do something else but do not know how to motivate
maybe i was forced to mean the promise for some seconds and tried to validate it by doing the cross sign but i stopped at the second time and canceled the promise
i also tend to sing a lot and just make noise in general i also have a bunch of tics i have noticed recently
it is also not just my family in public when i see people i fantasize about hurting them in different ways
i will be seeing her again tomorrow she arrives on thursdays fridays mondays tuesdays wednesdays and i do not see her on the weekend but sometimes she will visit for a quick chat about my life
i still yearn for her to be my best friend and partner again i know i need to stop checking her social media
you see i am very sceptical bcoz i often hear this is like a famous breakup reason if the person find another person
instagram fcked us up i let it happen of course obviously i am not sharing completely everything that we went through because i just do not have the energy for it there was a bunch of crap that led to our break up but for some reason it still hurts so bad
i have a problem since i was a child since i have memory i felt alone when i saw the other children playing with other children and those children did not invite me to play with them
after i had time to calm down at the apartment and she came crawling back i confronted her and demanded the truth
my parents are abusive assholes but i can not leave they pay for my school but i just feel that i am wasting everyone is time and money
the problem this time was that i did not love the girl and ended up seeing her more as a possible good friend
i know my psychiatrist is in favour of new treatments such as ketamine so would this give me a bit of sunshine
like i feel i will be alright that i will make it through this i also have more days though that i will always be miserable sad lonely and angry
i had an anxiety attack today because there were too many people i could not leave my room for hours and when i did i had to scoot out wrapped in a blanket it was humiliating but i could not walk and i could not speak i made my entire family angry and they were all yelling at me for it
i am 31 i can keep working on myself but i am unlikely to make huge fundamental changes at this stage i have quit drinking alcohol which will help but i still constantly fuck up when sober
no one takes me seriously anymore after my past attempts my family just ignores me completely and act like i am not even there
my so and i are willing to go to great lengths to help change things i have the mind set of one and i refused to file a statement or report my own injuries
our breakup was nearly 2 months ago and since day 0 we both hold nc looks like a month after the bu she started dating someone else which actually hurt me the bu was so awful i do not see an ending where we both get along coming please read my previous posts from my profile i really would like some advice
i want you to write down every challenge every mistake everything that person said that was not right any behaviour trait that your mind is now skipping on
i do not deserve to be alive i do not deserve anything i do not deserve any kindness i do not to deserve this i want to die i only deserve to die the only way i will get rest is by dying
i know she also have to respect him i was thinking going to the dog park she always go to but i do not know
i think many of you can understand how time consuming it was many times i saw acquaintances of me enjoying their lifes socializing and making friends
she had another son my brother who at the time was 46 he is a repeat offender and can not stay out of prison
anyway she was really flirty with other guys all through our relationship and i think deep down i knew something was off that there were probably other guys but really i did not care too much it is not like i thought i was going to marry this girl i was 18 and dating a 20 something year old stripper i was pretty happy
i think loneliness is the hardest thing to actually talk about because well if you are lonely you do not have someone to talk abt it with atleast in my case when i try talking about it with other people i really do not think they get it because they actually have like friends they can hang out with and chill with and i really do not have anyone to talk to about the deeper things in life
3 days later i called and said i wanted her back but she said no before we hung up she again told me she loved me
after all the effort it is my fault things are this way but it ended up being a little bit long first of all
she hates me because if it and her best friend is my ex friend too she is probably said a few things too
are these daily high and lows manic episodes or are they too short to be that get to know feel understand and trust your body
so i am a heroin addict prior to overuse of iv opioid pain killers by a medical facility to treat me i was vehemently against them i did not choose this every day i wish i could go back and undo everything that put me here
i have no idea why i kept trying or why i keep trying now everything in my eyes went from perfect to over in a matter of seconds
i could not understand why someone would want to erase someone they loved out of their mind but you taught me to understand it
i just want her to yell at me again or something i miss all the mundane things and just having conversations
it is even making me look back upon my decisions of taking the related class in my university and i just i know i hated myself for even thinking that
when i was misdiagnosed i was prescribed zyprexa about a months worth and it seems to immensely help when i am having a really bad day which happens about 3 times a month
i will probably kill myself some time this week this pain is just unbearable it is really important that i study these days
i told him i knew he would react like this and that when people tell me to reach out for help it would not work out
now that i have gone this long without and have zero hope for the future i find myself sometimes thinking about sometimes even vaguely planning suicide obviously i have not done it but it is never not in my forebrain
i am shy lonely person with only male friends i have been avoiding getting in some relationships with woman because i am so emotional and i quickly fall in love i decided to change i started to text with some girl and now every time she does not text me or just seens my message i became depressed
we both knew we were never going to live in the same location and we were not at that i love you so much let us fight for this point in our relationship yet
i am in tears i only remember one single happy christmas in this house like everything with this boy is over and i have no way to fix things that never needed fixing
i am fed up with everything nothing feels right i just feel numb i even attempted in september but the amount of sanitizer i drank was not enough to kill me
i can not figure out what changed but i felt so good then i stood up straight looked everyone in the eye
i always get the feeling they think i am weird or something like that which i know they are not doing but i still can not get rid of it
i can not run away i can not do anything i want to sleep for a very long time and i am hoping a lot of pills do the trick
noticing a pattern of laughter you do not intend to createi do not think my brain can take all of the negativity i have to deal with
the ex gf used to be a pretty good friend of mine but we kind of drifted apart and she confronted me on the last day of school and said some stuff about how i should not have done that and i should have talked to her and whatever which honestly had not crossed my mind bc i was so tired with everything
we told each other we were the love of our lives and were going to spend our lives together we took a trip out of state in august and were planning on moving to that state together
then she sent him a screenshot of me venting 3 months ago because we got into a major argument and i text her and said maybe i should have stayed with someone else but this was me being frustrated and questioning my future etc then she said i was hanging out with a friend who we have major respect for each other and been friends since grade school and said that i was hanging out with him which i was the day my fiancé left me for a day after my argument
she essentially said she is sad and lost and can not handle her thoughts alone atm i think she regrets our breakup but idk
she has mental illness and this is the reason i did not decline her proposal though i love her long ago from that proposal in these four years she gets into so many relationships now she is getting married
i just do not understand why i can not make the effort to move on or let the relationship go why would i continually put myself through this pain instead of proactively trying to focus on myself and move on how does he not care at all what would be the steps to moving on or getting over him
i am not sure if writing this had any sense i just needed a place where i could tell someone about it as i do not really have friend for this
you will be crying in a few months when you realize that who are you dated on instagram will not even cook you breakfast
anything that gives you a moment to feel happy and at peace there was no drugs no alcohol just three people talking and having deep conversation
i asked my friend to leave but she insisted on staying to hook up with the boy she was interested in
4 work out whether social media is helping or hindering your loneliness social media can make you feel even lonelier if you are constantly seeing people having a great time together on your newsfeed for some people however social media is a way to connect with others so it is difficult to suggest a blanket rule on this
i mean i feel like shit all the time but yknow i almost passed out three times because of anxiety and i am still overwhelmed
yelling i can not remember afterwards i am told i need to apologize for defending myself what the actual fuck later that day i starting letters for friends and my brother
but now looking at it and the issues that were at hand i am glad he is gone i even had to think about the future if he had not had broken up with me
in an effort to just explain to anyone who cared to not feel despair for my choices as i feel that no one besides my parents and employer should be saddened by my choice
this is a first i have no idea why this worked or how but i went from fully hyperventilating for 15 mins to focusing on the coldness and it forcing me to breath through my nose slowly this was such a good idea and i am so glad they were awake to help me
i feel so alone i do not feel like talking to anyone new going to bed at night alone and waking up in the morning alone is getting extremely draining
but i do feel so betrayed and want to be gone from his life like i never existed at all i want to start over with him gone from my life
i feel so mentally full like i just ate a buffet of self sabotagei hope all of my friends get drunk and high
frankly i do not want to live in a world plagued by the sadistic broken darkness of the human soul just to not make it more difficult for her after i was gone
how do i pull myself together and move on i honestly think 99 of all relationships are shit but just trying to live is hard enough
not sure sure how long i could lasthopefully one day and soon there will be zero hesitation so we decided or i guess trying to be friends
i know they are going to be rude to me in the morning i know they are going to forget my birthday
i will not be in the military like all the men in my family and i will not get married but i will be alive so a brief summary
i do not know if i will have the strength to push through the initial resistance though a care coordinator told me after i would given the pills away previously that perhaps i had a little bit of hope still fighting to want to live if i had managed to hold on long enough to pass the pills off to someone else even in a state of crisis
recently i have been feeling like i do not belong anywhere and i am the type of guy who always likes to put a positive spin on things but looking towards the future idk if i can keep doing what i am doing
i used my only local hotline and the attendant listened to me and did fuck all she only listened and wanted to hang up that made me so furious i lost interest in killing myself for the night so that kind of worked
so i would say a month has passed and i find out she is already going out with someone although i did not think much of it because i knew she liked this guy for a while before we started to date
my birthday just passed this month and i received a lovely surprise from best friends i have been trying to do nice things for people more often
but now this really hurt opening up to someone with my life and them opening up to me and basically feel like none of that meant anything so quickly
i tried to talk to my friend but they do not know what to do which is fair enough why should they so they just ignore it
hey guys just found this sub and i am hoping it will help me out around september i got dumped after 2 years of dating it crushed me first relationship first kiss first love
i do not want to see them hurt but it annoys me to see that everyone in my life is so much better off than me
no you do not want me to be fucking successful otherwise you would not try to take control over my life and tell me what to do and how to move
when i finally came out of my room from hiding earlier he actually acknowledged me he asked what i was doing in a nice way why would he do that after he was talking about me this makes me feel crazy and paranoid
or how to get the kind of help with the kind of quality and authenticity that i need for one all this time i have failed to solve that problem
i even agreed to an open relationship but it turns out i can not deal with that option my parents raised me better than that but she would bring the anger out of me
in the end we went our separate ways and when i checked his social media it seems as if he is waiting on his ex again because her and him have the same wording
the start of my 20s came with a bang actualisation of my deteriorating mental health due to this loneliness self loathing loss of interest in life lethargy etc i have spent the last years learning about myself i did not know how to make friends i did not know i had to the environment i grew up in discouraged me from interacting and bonding with people
i do not want to rearrange them but i can not ignore my ocd so i try to find a way to make ocd stop giving me anxiety for not doing the compulsion
i do not want a response at all but i just want to let the other person know how much i valued everything they gave me
but all i want is to hear from her i have these constant thoughts in my head if she is ever thinking of me just in the smallest way
i feeling that nobody ever cared about me i could not text for months and nobody would ask anything so much so much of it
i make sure to let him know i care and love him and check up on him every now and then
and now i am here on the fucking internet because you can not give me a hug i worry that he hates me or thinks i do not care about him when in reality i do
however i acted pretty needy during the relationship and the few days after the breakup which is probably an unmentioned reason she broke up with me so now i have been going on no contact
i tried to be understanding and empathetic about how difficult a time he was having i explained my situation to give him more context
however he and i ended up getting a job in different states but we decided to do ldr for another year
minimal texts or greeting for days i asked whyshe said she is busy at work everything was good when he came down
i did not have a friend to talk to before so i got used to dealing with things on my own even if i suck at it
i feel like there is no point in my existence it is not like i can change the world i will not leave any impact
next month would have been our 15 yr anniversary we held on for a while but maybe it is best that i move on
today i cried a lot until i slept a lot yesterday i did a test of iq i scored 80 i was not surprised
i am mad that i can not make gingerbread houses with you i am mad that we are not watching christmas movies together right now
it took me a year to lose four kg and i feel horrible about my body as it is at the moment
we had lots of fun despite everything the good moments were really good and the bad moments were really really bad
i was wondering if anybody could recommend any groups or places online for people like me where i could maybe form a friendship i find it very difficult to relate to the average person because of what i have been through and it would be great if i could find a group of people i could identify with
last night i did not try anything suicide related exactly but i tried to strangle myself which obviously would not kill me just gave me a sore neck for a long while
there was even a time that she is sad when i talk to her but as soon as her friend comes in or her cousin is there with us she becomes so lively and happy she always shows to her friends that we are a perfect couple but she is too serious when we are together
it was just a moment of realizing like why am i putting in all this effort why does he want to stay in contact when he can not even tell me how he feels when he does not even seem to miss me
i was taken off my medications and could not longer see my therapist that all nearly ended me however i started thinking did i really deserve those presents of course i did not
i also put in a lot of effort to get to know my exs family so we would also hang out with them a lot which was fine but he would leave me to hang out with his little brother or mom often when i came over to see him and he never put nearly the same effort into getting to know my family or friends so that hurt me a lot
week one of our relationship the told me this go out have fun live their lives until now i have been trapped into that toxic marriage
i am planning on giving her a letter with how much i loved her hoping things would have gone differently i can not bare to see her loving someone else it just breaks my heart
this was especially good since i have a lot of trauma and so take a long time to trust someone particularly romantically because i always expect them to dump me suddenly and tell me it all meant nothing let us blame high school bullies for pulling the date prank on me a few times
from then on it changed all most especially my mental health from midmarch up to mid may i was at home clashing with uncle and father from time to time
the book mind over mood by padesky is a commonly recommended resource and a staple at most libraries i met one guy he liked me
also right now he is not fully opened up to me he always says do not worries to me without really explaining what is wrong
i am already completely dead inside and i want all the pain to fucking go away and this will not happen until i kms
comes to a day where you can not find yourself where feeling become a ghost of your lost soul something better left all alonesomething not meant to be found
recently my gf of 6 years broke up with me because i confronted her about her cheating on me she referred to me as a worthless piece of shit
we must life for right now that is all we have this present moment and i have not told my friends the whole story about what happened
if i suffer more it should be fair still can not wait for the day when i am allowed to cut my wrists open and fucking end it already
but i do not really care anymore i do not care anymore about college family and pretty much everything else then we agreed it was a goodbye
i love i really do i know it this was midmarch over the course of the next few weeks we had to move out of our apartment
nor if you ask me does that make it right i am currently trying to be seen by medical professionals for my shoulder injury
i have been with my boyfriend for over 25 ish years and my insecurities regarding his ex has been a recurring topic
could not see the road while i was driving should have pulled over but just kept crying while screaming i do not know what to do to myself
a few days later some things dawned on me about my behavior do not get me wrong she cheated on me but i have forgiven her
in fact the iron therapy in the gym has never felt better and for those of you trying to find a means to cope i highly recommend channelling the sadnessangerdisappointment into those weights
of course we had some rough patches but i thought we loved each other i am so confused and am having panic attacks bc i am not really sure how to handle this
i am posting this here since tool fans seem like the people i feel the closest to since we all share a beautiful passion about this band
he told me there is noone else but i feel like there is someone that he might have taken interest on the cycle keeps repeating over and over and over
i can not put myself through that it would because me too much pain but i am in so much pain my heart physically hurts
she spoke to her father regarding this relationship and felt that it would have been a marriage on conditions i could not deny that
i will be here tomorrow and the day after wishing i was not here at all so help me understand please i never asked for any of this why can not i just quietly go why do i have to trylive who said i cannot simply fall asleep and turn the switch off after all it is not as if i am making any contributions big or small
i was raised in a tiny town where there were barely any others my age volatile family situation and living through a natural disaster meant it was hard for me to find any stability
i worry that if i do this and he does not have the memories anymore he will just forget easier and not have something to look back on nothing to regret about which i want more than having him back
i could easily get along with people and i know how to make a room laugh lately however i just feel lonely and disconnected
i feel like i am never meant to be happy forever lonely putting on a mask to prevent people from coming in
i was so lonely in boot camp i kissed a picture of her every night and kept it close to me everywhere i went even when i was not supposed to
i still feel guilty for breaking it off he ended up not speaking to me for 10 days as established by me this has happened before after an argument but for less time
what to do if you are worried about never having been in a relationshiploneliness is a sad piano relax song which i wrote in a particular period of my life
i think it is important to mention that i was having issues having sex at all due to psychological erectile disfunction that i got over and to some extent i got together with this woman to resolve this issue and this is why i thought it was ethical to break up once she developed feelings
but then slowly they stopped talking to me which i did not mind since i was much more closer to that one girl
my adhd would not allow me to fall asleep until about 12 or 1 am masturbation was also another issue although the sex fell off pretty hard about a month ago
white powder on my black screen why is nobody callingfuck it i would not pick up anyways because i am here alone with my only love
i have been really struggling lately with not being able to be happy with what i have i am finding it impossible to live in the moment and just enjoy life
when i talked to him after he said it just did not work out this time and who knows if it will be the same in the future
he lashes out at family and resents our father he wants to fix our fathers mess and after that he probably wants to commit suicide
i think it is because i might be clingy idk if i am actually clingy or not i do not know how to start conversations with people either
god why do you do this to me why do you rip out my last hopei am ready to do it i have noone to live for who cares who does not i do not care
it is most important that the thoughts you act on are not being effected by your problems always make decisions based on what you think is best rather than what seems best
though i feel she could make me bend backwards in love i do not think i am worth the pain i am so confused sorry this post is all over the place
i stopped crying a little while ago today was the first day i did not check one of her social media accounts
i feel that this is not good for me but i find it so scary to let him go i experience so much stress and relive all the moments that hurt me over and over in my head this story is really long but trust me a lot more has happend
i encouraged her to go for it but to lay down ground rules and to confirm that he had broken things off with his long distance girlfriend
i am normally very stoic but as i sat with him in his room earlier he was not scared he thanked me for being there and he told me it is okay i am already 82 if i die it is okay and i absolutely lost it i started crying and as i type this i can not stop crying all over again
also i do not think people would hate me if i show effort and there is 7 billion other people in the world so if they do not care i can also move to the next person and conversation
with studying it is better once i get drawn into it but watching a person talk for hours is just unbearable for me
i should but that is a whole other set of feelings i also deleted dating apps and do not plan on redownloading them just because i am lonely
you always knew how to make me cry i do not want you i just want someone like youmy future exboy friend and i are spending the last moments together in our flat
i was so confused but we are on a period of nocontact no she goes back to college in latejanuary for 4 months at least
i am still in bed wearing your bracelet that now hurts me as much as it comforts me i am still thinking about you and all the plans that will not happen i hate how pathetic i am but even though i do not think you feel the same or will even see this and regardless will not know it is me who posted i miss you
hanging myself or drowning maybe an overdose or a fucking stroke cuz life makes me freaking stressed no cuts no shots slow suicide through drugs is an option too
i cuddle you i kiss you i am with you out of habit many things about you are not for me
sorry for the long rant but i wanted to get this off my chest as i felt extremely lonely over the past few months because of the pandemic and the fact that i live alone
even though a serious relationship is what i always wanted as chandler bing says i am hopeless i am lonely and desperate for love
i sleep on my back to avoid a painful the next day this is my least favorable position therefore i lose hours of sleep due to this
first link is the website and it will explain everything we started working on this in april and have gained a lot of momentum
but yeah sadly i am awake and i had to drop out of school my school sees me as a threat to the society
in 2 years since escaping a sexually abusive situation in my home i have dated 3 peoplenote this is just a rant you all do not need to share your feelings
but will a man i actually admire ever feel like this and want to sacrifice his singleness for me or are they all already in relationships and the ones left are afraid to commit or just belowabove my league
they are all in a relationship one if them is already married and the other is planning to and the third is getting their first child
i tried to talk things out with you and you said you would change but your actions spoke louder than your words
other friends would not be as supportive in my aspirations or their support would be really surface level giving the usual go for it i am with you kind of statements completely doing a 180 the next instance calling my aspirations stupid and unreasonable
i can not stop thinking about how comfortable suicide would be how comfy it would be just dealing with nothing and feeling nothing i wish i did not have that seatbelt on and i had a quick death
the physician told me that nowadays everyone is depressed or burned out what do you want and i asked him to write me an excuse letter for being absent from school for a few days
i think about how easily she jumped to someone else and question whether she ever loved me at all pops up at times in some sense i feel i am incomplete like the time spent breathing her in and the memories which built a part of who i am are now dying one cell at a time as my oxytocin bleeds to ink
do you think she is confused about us or do you genuinely think she just wants a friendship i feel like we talk too much to be just friends as you do not speak to your friends all day everyday surely i know i do not
i asked her are you getting ready to leave she said yes she was going to go find something to do i told her i know you said you planned on moving out in february but if got a place to go now i would prefer it if you packed you shit and started moving there now
after ending a 5 years relationship and cut all forms of communications for 31 days i am still madly in love with that person
feeling alone 247 i have nothing in common with my family my friends are all ok without me and busy in their own lives every girl that speaks to me likes someone else what is the point anymore do i just accept this is me forever
i would say all this started most likely around october this year i was a very consistent weed smoker and would go to my supplier everyday
i would make temporary friends who were my friends for the semester and once it was over i would never see them again
well maybe not even move on but just shut down we went to our first marc e bassy concert and it was amazing
also time is sooo fast it is been so faster since the start of quarantine it is crazy time flies so fast because of the monotonous activities i do this contributes to my sadness 1 second kind of translates to 3 seconds some months feel faster than others
how it stems from a friendship and just like memories is always there but with waves of dialogue where ever i look
i have done it all almost every bad thing in the book i have done i should have been thrown out by them i should have been disowned but they still fucking love me how how how how how how how how how how can they
and whenever you are testdriving a new belief start collecting references that support it and that can make it stronger as soon as possible
it is uncontrollable sometimes i start to freak out sometimes i will blow her phone upright now i am back on track again by the way eating healthy and working out 6 times per week
always thinking my friends are up to something bad thinking they dislike me or are planning something i have thoughts of my family hurting me and me having to kill them
i said what i said out of love and i honestly wanted her to feel better it was just a really hard and long week for both of us
hi so i am aware that i should go to therapy but due to some current personal life things that is not possible for a couple of months but i was hoping that i could get some help on how to deal with anxiety
her husband recently got deported and she is found herself alone for the majority of her day my so lives with her but finds himself seeing her maybe 1 hour every day if he is lucky
at the time i dodged the question and gave weak affirmations but i have thought about it the past few days and i have decided that no i do not think i want to enter such a serious ldr with someone i doubt i even love in the first place
i said stuff i should not have said and i can not ever take it back and now everyone including him is going to hate me
but now i am crying and am completely broken to my soul i have become everything i said i would never be
if anyone has any advice regarding how to get my motivation back that will be helpful sorry for the long post and rant and the negativity and thanks if you guys have read it all the way through
i met him through a mutual friend 2 years ago we kind of flirted but not dated for six months and then we started dating and got together
mental health to me is important and if you understand this you would understand how much your actions and thoughts influence your livelihood doing the right things and thinking the right things make us much better things i hope everyone can see that
i am not asking for a response or for you to start speaking to me again i just want you to know how i feel thru it all
christmas got harder this year and the new year is always my loneliest time of the year i just want the ability to connect with someonesomething
she has a tumblr which half of it is just porn and one day i found that she was selling nudes
i remember not dating or partying or making new friends bc i just wanted him and i wanted his approval and affection
it was overall a pretty peaceful break up and i have no ill feelings towards her but i am just so fucking sad
i have been in two long relationships in my life with a 7 month break between the two my first boyfriend was my first love and even though we needed to end and he was a dick i still thought about him throughout my next relationship which lasted 5 years i do not think i ever truly healed from that first heartbreak
a constant fight in my head to try and see past the pain and regret a daily fight to just fucking hold on for a little longer
we then realized what we had done and we promised that we would tell no one for a while then i took her home and went to sleep again
juliet is the colder but still loves romeo and problematic person with my disorder i feel like this all the time
i feel like it was done fo her a rise out of me but i also can not shake the feeling that they are talking shit about me like obviously i do not know but it bothers me also in the beginning when they were first hanging out she requested to follow me on ig and i accepted and requested back and stalked and there was nothing
the discomfort of the cold will fully stimulate your nervous system and it will change your focus attention and reset how you are feeling
i just wish there was a way to just get your memories wiped i would seriously take that option regardless of the cost
i do not know what i would do without my mom my world is not yellow anymore i end up changing my number cleaning out my closet and i found her high school diploma
things such as her daughters birth certificate and whatever stumbled across some old pics of us together why is it that people actively put effort into constructing social connections with people when everything is so temporary
i have no access to helpful and affordable mental health therapy or resources the free ones my college provides like i said have been garbage to me
i am afraid of even tho i might feel more i might not be able to make true friends that i can count on be silly be myself all because i might not be a person that they find interesting
they all gave me 6 months to see any improvement otherwise they are not going to even associate with me now i do not want that and neither do they
now i i have an even shorter fuse there is nothing more i can do i got pretty pathetic at the end begging you to stay with me
i want to pull through for my unborn baby which is due soonjust few tips and how can i stop those music tracks
but most importantly i feel really scared that i am facing all this alone i do want to live this really sucks although i am breathing i feel dead i want to really live
imagine we are all in a pool floating on lilos none of us can swim but the lilos keep us afloat so it is okay
he has struggled with alcohol and gambling addictions i believe his whole adult life and i seem to be the only one who actually gives a shit
according to my dad he started off talking and when my uncle did not get it he began to yell at him
i do not know if girls just do not find me attractive but i can not seem to find anyone no matter hard hard i try
i have always been very active and used to do highlyintense exercise 45 times per week so was very tonedfit but i have developed some kind of eating disorder where i either eat next to nothing yesterday i had half a bowl of cereal and one full meal and other days i will eat far too much mostly processed snacks and give myself stomach problems
and even after seeing that she has posted a video on her onlyfans account about how she is going to be celebrating her friends birthday and i saw that she actually has been shooting amateur porn videos on her onlyfans account for a year or two i think so she is clearly fine but god damn do i feel like shit still
i have no one to talk to and i do not even connect with others anymorei love her still but it is like i am scared of letting go
i simply said to both of them that they are equally right as false that this is never going to get resolved and i refuse to pick a side since they are both fucking insane
i was going to try and get myself into a residential treatment program to make life livable again but i am so terrified they will have to draw blood or i will not be able to go outside or something
i had three boundaries during this entire relationship 1 call me at least once a day because communication is important even if its only for 5 mins 2 let us try to hangout once a week and 3 we continue to be exclusive
tw how do people keep going why do people keep going i can not figure it out i was in an abusive relationship from age 1720
i hate myself blame myself so anxious no confidence no integrity i asked her if there was anything good i did or anything about me that she liked so i had something to build up from she said i am not here to praise you like a child
so no i am not out of that web yet i like to believe though that i am a victim of living this life
being confined to it for the past 12 years i might lose my mind whatever is left of iti wish i could hug and cuddle and kiss a girl
i get rejected by literally every girl i shoot my shot with and i am just not in a good place now
i try to connect with people and i have some great interactions with people but it just seems that nothing stuck
the immeasurable first messages on dating sites when i find someone i like which take so long to compose be witty show you have read the profiles ask questions be interesting enough for them to ask questions be casual and confident but not overly so and then to make sure nothing can sound creepy then hit send
her mental health went downhill was not too good before same as mine she was in a really bad place that was about it
i feel so dumb for actually believing someone that you are breaking up with he said i do not do anything i took a shower calmed down and cleaned the house
he knows being on the phone gives me anxiety but i felt sorry and i apologized for days and he said you should have said this sooner and broke up with me a couple of weeks ago
i have become obsessed with myself because i only have me to talk to and get feedback from if i need anything
now i am too tired of putting any effort to be with a girl because i feel like they would leave me anyway
but somehow getting my meds right for my graves diseasegetting on medication to help my anxiety cymbaltaand taking the right sleep medication trazadonehas helped me to be able to cope better
5 days ago that was his last activity before her i was never really religious was baptized as a child but never went to church
i told him i would forgive him for everything as long as he has nothing else to hide and he tells me it all
i used to have a life i loved and a promising career happily divorced i knew i did not want a second wife or any kids a friend convinced me otherwise and twisted my arm into a relationship now we have two young kids
what could i have done to be mistreated so bad to still care while i am ill and still get disrespected when i am pushing out my pains to help you
we were not talking as much and i was trying to figure out why it did not matter because we met in real life and we had a great time except
i said i am going to pack my bag and go in the morning in the morning we talked despite him being hung over
i can not even see myself in the future after talking a little bit after 2 weeks of no contact things seemed to have been going well
thanks so much in advance looking forward to reading your answersit is been 2 weeks since she ghosted me i am greatly suffering from this
time does not heal your wounds after a breakup it helps do not get me wrong but your full recovery is mostly dependent on your actions and the mindset you possess
eventually he needed some income so he thought about selling his clothes second hand and he was not really good with this stuff and i had a friend who did this as a hobby
i think that the little signs of affection are more important than we use to think i just do not know if i should
therpay ist just one talk every weak even if you stay on the station the rest is just boardgames i feel like this is the way it needed to be
i know she is dating someone or at the very least in a very casual rebound relationship so i know it is not to rekindle anything
i called and asked the tool manager if i had one issued to me but he did not tell me because he was busy
so i just intentionally shut myself off when i am feeling like this i do not say anything i do not participate in any group activity and i just stay like this until it goes away and i wait for someone to ask me if everythings okay maybe because i know if i seem distant enough someone will worry or care about how i am doing
and you would think after virtually 4 fucking years i would be over it but here i am having her in my nightmares every single goddamn night for these past years
she constantly worries that she will come home from work and find me dead i just want to give her peace of mind
so why was i not happy we both met each other when we were broken which i know is not ideal but in my later years of my twenties i have realised what i want in life and there was a disconnect that could not be resolved
and if there was a button i could press to fkn let go of the past i would press it but there is not
have no one to share it with dead against joining any sort of online group or social media for it because of problems in the past with former interests never fitted in had drama too old and boring putting up with being treated like an obsessive freak by others everyone tells me to have hobbies or interests but they just make me feel more miserable and lonely when i have them
i helped her understand a lot of things going on in her life as well and she helped me get on the right track and actually start making moves in my life cos before i was not sure what i was wanting to do but she made everything clear
it breaks my heart and makes me feel sad knowing all that but i feel like i can not tell him that because i know he wants me to be happy and it might prevent him to open up to me if he knows that it makes me feel this way
i feel so intertwined in every way with him ughi do not mind when she freaks out on me and she does often
i feel like i am never going to be truly happy and even if i am there is too much pain that is going to come before that
he looked a lot better when we went to see him but it was still a huge shock since we had never really seen him injured before
starting with a couple years ago my mental stability really started to deteriorate i ended up turning to self harm for a while
any suggestions on how to be both productive and to not feel so alonei do not even know what else to say i am just too depressed to even think about it too much
i really really reccomed it man happy holidays to the people who see this if you celebrate then and i hope you are well have a cookie and a snowflake and hopefully have a good day rest of the year and new year
it affected me badly that i started crying i did not let my brother see me nor hear me cry because i probably looked and sounded pathetic
i want you to again be ascertaining to yourself that it was good that you broke up you disconnected yourself from some pain and this is you facing it
in my case i did not even think much about my own future andor try to build it then she told my whole family about it i feel i am treated lesser than everyone else here now
he also left a scary note behindi have not told any of family and friends yet owing to i do not want to spoil their christmas
why are they doing this do they not want to talk to me anymore or is there some other reason why they do not talk to me anymore
same at the previous one it just happened like for two minutes when i was receiving the man i was not crying anymore
my 22nd birthday is tomorrow and i am not celebrating it because no one cares all of my peers celebrate their birthday somehow with either a party or hanging out with their friends or whatever but me just going to be another day because for some reason my birthday is as not important as everybody elses
everything was fine and then he broke up with me october 4th and we have not spoken a word since i just do not get it i do not understand
anyways both of them are very depressed my friend a is to the point of suicide and even tried to buy a gun
but i do not want anyone planning my life out for me and do not want to live the boring generic path of going to school and work 95 the having a midlife crisis i am talking about taking the road less traveled that is where i want to be
going off of that i find myself over analyzing every little thing in this world and the people in it to the point where i know exactly how someone acts or what they will say next i then try and match myself to the person in little ways to make myself seem relatable and likable
it is weird like i feel like i have wasted my life i have friends i am even the president of our anime and game club i even have a girlfriend
i wish i could tell him the weeks he shut me out made me look at things differently but it is to late and he did not give me that chance
but now i am absolutely obsessed with how my hair looks since that is the only factor i can influence at this point
and i am talking about things someone does if they are just sitting i do not know much about dissociation but what i have read suggests that people can move around and stuff either without remembering it or fully experiencing it kind of like a blink and you will miss it experience
that is almost 40 of my money so that is a lot for methe problem is that gradually everyone went home and only her friend and i remained
5 15 months after bu i asked why she did not want to work out our issues now ld was not a factor she responded i can not keep doing this with you there is nothing that i have not already told you the letter i sent you was your closure you need to stop messaging me across all platforms
is the drive for love and sex a madeup societal learned behaviour or a biological one or more likely it is both
but let us be honest the voices do hate me and that is no secret i do not blame them i am such a horrible excuse of a person sorry mean waste of space
you think that everything mentioned above is nothing but mere whining i really wish that those who think so were in my position for a single day not for their entire life
i fucking should just kill myself at this point because i will never get a job i have gotten rejected everywhere and people who hurt me are succeeding
my mother is always telling me to get a degree and get a good job after school so i will not be financially insecure
i do not want to do anything with you anymore ending up hating you is my freedom just pain i wish everything could be ok
now let me tell you what these experts try so f hard to cover upi am going to tell you why trying to get your ex back toxic or not does not work
hi everyone i know i am not the only one but the past few months have been breaking me into pieces i moved away from my parents and my home country to another one in europe for a new job and due to covid i did not get the job it is been months now i have no income neither does my bf we live with his parents
i have suffered from suicidal ideation since i was about her age too but my father died when i was 11 so i was quickly dxd but not helped very much
this is for the best and i should not have any regrets because i have done everything i could to make it work but at the end it was not enoughwhat he wanted i should not feel guilty or punish myself for missing him it is a natural feeling and it should pass i will be okay so will everyone in this subreddit sending love
i am 23 now i have been in therapy for 4 years and i just can not find joy in anything i used to be so fucking joyful
people usually enjoy their birthday but i feel this day is just a reminder of how lonely i amso yeah not much but i just wanted to let that out
i think he got unintentionally influenced saw how well his brother was doing with construction contracts and owning 20 of a restaurant and told me he was happier being back home and was not happy where we were currently living
anyway that is me there is no point to this post it is just what it is i am not in any danger or suffering a mental break or anything just talking about loneliness
i feel like i am not important to anyone anymore and i do not see myself worthy of being loved i wanted to call the samaritans but since it was christmas eve all the lines were busy
what if by the time actual on campus classes start people already have their own groups and i am left alone i just hate myself so much
i am sorry you might be going through this and it may have been caused due to various reasons or in my case due to the effect lockdown had on me
these days he will just ignore me randomly for no apparent reason as well idk what is wrong who knows maybe its him not wanting to be my friend anymore but i am worried and any help would be super cool thanks in advance

my 26m now exgirlfriend 24f came over last night to pick up all her stuff after she broke it off cold a week and a half ago with no reason other than she does not see us together in the future anymore and basically ghosted me since then
her familiy argues her saying that all other family members who had previously had mental illnesses in the past have just toughed it out and that she can just tough it out
to stop the panic attack i took my proscription medicine for headaches my dad sees this and starts watching me i then i start looking for another medicine
if life is always meant to be shitty and unfair i will end it and i would do it right now if i could there is nothing selfish about taking ones own life if i can spend a lot of time thinking rationally about it
i got fed up and said i had to go then disconnected and i am sitting here frustrated because i do feel like hanging out i do feel like being social i do not always but what we were doing was not that it was boredom and silence i was technically with friends but did not feel like it if i wanted to feel alone i would not have joined the call in the first place
everything feels set up for me like i know it sounds narcissistic as fuck but i sort of feel like the main actor of this planet everyone around me feels like an actor who is only job is to make me dread my existence
suddenly she ask for breakup when asked she said it because she lost interest in the relationship n want to pursue personal dream first
how should i approach my mother and talk to her about that i do not want anyone to tell me that i should go to the police or anything i will not do that she is my mom
should i take escitalopram for anxiety or should i get over it naturally i have no friends no social connections and no one to talk to
i was once again not comfortable with the idea that she would be on tinder she told me to trust her
a friend of mine selfharms is suicidal he has a therapist an his parents know but he also told me that he uses drugs i really want to help him but i do not know how maybe the therapist is better then me
too late to try now since everybodys found their own circles and i do not fit in any of them not that i am saying to beg but make sure they know what you think
i was doing good for a while but i think it full hit me she is gone the other day and i have had alot of weak moments since then
he was 12 years older something i never thought i would consider but thought that must have been what i needed all this time

my family does not deserve to be hurt by me anymore her family does not deserve to be hurt by me anymore either
my car keys slipped out of my hand and into the gutter i literally just left it there and went back to bed in my work clothes
people say to not overthink or to distract myself but how is that even possible distractions do not work no matter how hard i try
i sleep on my back to avoid a painful next day this is my least favourable position therefore i lose hours of sleep due to this it sounds ridiculous but if you had to sleep on your back 365 days a year you would understand on days i need to be up early the next day this could also onset a seizure as a result i highlight this as a large problem
still i can not help feeling so alone it does not help that i am still processing some rough break ups both friendships and romantic
not anymore i feel like all those memories i had spending time with my mom growing up were a past life
idk what to do how do you make yourself accept change there are no simple answers and everything that is not medicine only works if you have the right mentality but when you are a logic driven person like me it just
that is what i have been reduced to because no one will hire me i do not do manual labor work i used to do thinking work its my age but we are not permitted to discuss age anywhere not in askhr or any job forum we must pretend its a non issue
we treated her like the most precious thing better than many people treat their kids and a big part of the reason why i love her so much is that i terminated a wanted pregnancy the year before it was a hard time but i could not possibly take financial care of a baby even worse i have been depressed for many years and i just knew i would be a terrible mother the abortion nearly killed me karma i do not even know
i know it is a stupid thing but my dad was always a bit short tempered i do not blame him for that i have seen this my whole life
her boyfriend of 12 years broke up with her yesterday and she is devestatedshe is going to move in with me on the weekend
i have no idea of what i want to do with my life everyone else seems to know who they are and what they want but all i do is stare at my wall listen to music and think about all the mistake i have do made
my issue is that she and a few of my mates are coming over tomorrow for a mutual friends birthday now i am planning on dressing very well and showing everyone a side that i have never really tapped into
i have to check my back seat 3 times to make sure there is no one hiding and on my way out of the store i feel like i can see three people exchanging looks and looking at me but i know it is all in my head
a college student a hopeful medical student but that seems further away day by day we went out for coffee we talked about how shitty you are about sex about life
the thing is i still do not imagine myself being with him forever i do not want to move in with him we tried this whilst at uni and though i was not in the best mental state to start off with living together really made things worse for me and consequently him i do not see us getting married and i am not sure i want kids and i know he does
but today in the middle of xmas eve dinner she blew up on my dad for no reason he had asked what type of jam was on the table

i have issues focusing on work school work or even things i want to do myself like learning japanese but i am not hyperactive i am incredibly lazy so could i have add any thoughts

in short everything that goes on during an involuntary psychiatric hold as i found out a few days ago when i tried to go to a hospital for treatment only to have my abuser tell the hospital that i was suicidal before i could give any information myself
i have friends but i do not want to burden them with my mental health issues and i am also scared if i open up about it they would run away from me
i am still healing slowly opening myself up to the reality that all of this was a big wake up call for him neither of us wanted the breakup but i got scared and ended things instead of doing something new to try resolve the issues i get that he lacked control in his life to do anything and i could not be the strong one anymore
i will never be that person who is in a relationship for years or gets married getting married was just about the most important life goal i had for myself
so admit to this nostalgia is a liar when revisiting our best memories while omitting all our truths and the truth the truth is that not every experience is meant to last forever

i broke up with my ex 5 days ago so now i have more time to talk with this guy and we are just so connected have a lot of common interests and that time flies by when we are talking to each other
thus they stopped all his treatment eventually he had also been bullied growing up differentlywe have been together for 5 years and he gaslights me
i hate myself and i think my friends think less of mei am only 33 but i just can not take it anymore
everyone i know is celebrating christmas eve and i am not going to be the one ruining anyones night i am spending tomorrow as well as new years all alone
when asked she said it because she lost interest in the relationship n want to pursue personal dream first i ask her why can not she be with me n pursue at the same time
so i took her back as i felt the same way to think this place was once a home of pure warmth and love
the hardest part is the guilt of leaving the ones i got left behind i hope i can find some way to leave closure
he just said okay but do not give yourself any ideas from where there is none basically suggesting i am making things up
i am a 38 years old female i have been married for 4 years and live in the town where my husband grew up i have been in this town for 9 years but i was born in a different country
i already know you will think about it but let me tell you how i want to you to think about it
i have no interests that are productive no friends outside of the internet and i hate where and how i live i am emotionally numb to everything i really do not care about anything at all not even family
after this i tied a noose to hang myself sadly the noose came undone the police were called 4 times my bedroom door was broken down they took my phone
because so many decisions have been tainted by my mom interjecting her unwanted opinion and trying to impose her value system on top of mine as i escape her grip by becoming more independent things naturally get a little easier but equally it leads me to question so who exactly am i and what i do want out of life and have the decisions i have taken to get here been my own or hers
i first became aware of this problem when i was 56 years old my father had just dropped me off at kindergarten and an employee told me good morning
i was the second person he trusted with his schizophrenia which he now had under control or that is what he told me of course
i have a feeling no one would ever really love me then we will not talk for a week or more and he will randomly hit me up
i remember feeling so startled when my parents stopped hiding sad and scary things from me and it still feels that way like if they are upset or scared or sad then everything is really hopeless
i feel so ashamed of myself for having so much trouble making friends and keeping them being single my whole life and only fantasizing just getting my drivers license only several months ago and still feeling anxious about driving
hi a few weeks ago my bf ended our relationship well he suggested it and i ended it the thing is that we have been together for two years and he is now in another country
he called me petty but the whole time it was him acting strange it hurts so much because i would never do this to him
i should not put an expectation that everyone i encounter will be the greater person and be my best friend until death but i also should not think that every conversation will lead nowhere
and i am not attracted to supermodels or whatever i think what people consider averagelooking women are still stunningeven more so i am reminded that i caused this loneliness myself
then the zoom came i waited and waited 30 minutes later i messaged them to remind them no response i gave up after another 30 minutes or so
that i am no longer pain she will be able to grieve and then hopefully move on with her life i feel so stupid because i did not know that was cheating i want to kill myself
about a day ago i was thinking about killing myself solely because life was just boring and i would never amount to anything and that was fine it was not really sadness more just acceptance
every day is just the same i do not know her name which is strange but i knew she was my child
i am happy with my boyfriend but i am too young for relying on him only i want to have other people to talk to and hang out with
like i am not supposed to be alive i do not want to die but i feel forced to kill myself so i stop hurting others
but there are days when i wonder will i end up alone seems everyone else around me has this group of good friends
ig i was crying my heart out all day but she never knewand then i had to stop talking to her
how the snowball started was that i do have a record from when i was 20 and he said he was ok with it however he was telling his mom dad his best friend who told her husband his manager and later i found out he told his ex
today i picked it up i bought the same model tool for a lot of money it is expensive because the idea i had was to buy another and pass it off as the original i know it is a stupid idea the serial numbers would not match and would not have the calibration sticker
as such loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people and those who feel lonely are alone the causes of loneliness are varied and include social mental emotional and physical factors
its been a few months since my two year relationship ended and all i have to say is that things get so much better
he said he would never get into any relationship but i was waiting for him to talk it slow and talk it out
the other thing and this is probably what will put peoples noses out of joint is that the women i am attracted to looks and mind are not in my league or level or whatever you call it
i also very easily get overwhelmed yet the school i am going to crams me with homework and my parents essentially want me to be perfect when i do my schoolwork and get perfect grades
i try to help but what ever i do something now she finds something in her eyes that is wrong nothing i do is right anymore
i dream of dying i dream of very gruesome and mean things to do to myself because i feel like maybe it will open me up maybe it will give me what i need to snap out of this i feel like a zombie i feel like i need something
turns out he was in a relationship he did all of this with me and when he rejected me he told me he was not ready for a relationship and he should not mess around with other peoples feelings he was just in love with another person the entire time dating and just using me for when they probably got in a fight or he felt his self esteem drop
i woke up in the middle of the night with the weight of a boulder on my chest and there is nothing to relieve it i tried calling the suicide hotline and they hung up on me because i do not have a plan
this has left me wondering if i really have adhd or what even is going on i would love if anyone familiar with this kind of situation could share their take on it and if you potentially have any nonstimulantbased medication recommendations for adhd
i fucking hate myself for everything i have done the strongest feeling that i got every tears i see my parents cry makes me regret so much
at the age of 5 i tried cutting my wrists with a knife because something upset me real bad at age 10 i started breaking pencils and started using it to hurt my wrists
i have to go all in on something if i want to live and i am scared i am going to miss end up with a bullshit degree or even worse end up with a job that makes me a slave again
and you do not got to worry about not talking to me again because we will still talk do not even worry about that at all
i feel like in a few weeks i will deeply regret this and want her back or i will have sex with another girl and then instantly regret breaking up with her and obviously at that stage it is too late
our relationship had a lot of problems but it seemed that our love for each other always ruled allidk what else to say i am 22 m california usa
month later get invited to party ask if girl will be there she will be i say maybe next time because she was bitchy to girlfriend i explain what happens and they agree girl was wrong they do not invite her so we show up
i take them as needed as per instruction but they do still prescribe me a full months script whenever i go back for a followup so i have more of them than i need i suppose i did not intend to stockpile them for suicide the tons of discontinued meds were my gotos previously but it is just kind of sitting right there
and all i wanted was to talk to my best friend because i know he would care i was even more upset only making my tics worse because i wanted to talk to him
feel so isolated it is maddening as half the time best i get is talking to the voices in my head but even they get bored of me
i have no set purpose on this planet no specific reason to have been born and given i have no goal or dream i have accepted that and worked on making life worth it
i just know if i found the right person how great it would feel to be so close to someone both physically and emotionally
i said that i was going to escape this but it is back with vengeance i do not want to do it but the pain unbearable good god it hurts so bad it is 400 am and i still have not slept fuck help me i can not take it anymore
and will i meet someone new do i want that i have so much i am worried about on top of being miserable about being broken up with
my grandmother keeps praying that i will make it in life i am sorry ma but nothing is working i can not eat can not sleep i can not do this anymore
i like hanging out with family but i do not want to sit down and feel like i have to run for life all day
and even now i am leaving out so many details a lot more has happened lost friends got my privacy invaded developed a nicotine and caffeine addiction and an eating disorder
my mother also projected her anger at me i would get shouted at hairpulled dragged a lot for the smallest of things
just smile just think positive just think happy thoughts anthony fremontlook him up in the fleshi have been really struggling with loneliness
i know they are supposed to be nonjudgemental and unbiased but i believe it is impossible for them to be completely neutral
i see all these movies novels and reallife people look so happy in relationships and when i look at myself i wonder what is wrong with me
he woke up one day and decided he did not want to do it anymore does it get easier the heart ache
i just wish i felt like i mattered to someone we have a group of mutual friends she is so happy and carefree in group texts
and do not even get me started on dating there is a guy i like but he is so sociable and popular that even after he confessed to have a crush on me i have been incapable of mingling myself into his social life despite us knowing a lot of people in common
last august my sister had to go to the hospital and talk things out because she could not live with so many panic attacks and anxiety anymore
i am angry and furious and just hate everything i no longer find satisfaction in the things that help me relax
i was always afraid of killing myself because i believe in nothing so death is really the end of it all for me
after i take a dose i feel lighter happier open and tbh a little anxious but more looking forward to the future anxiety too happy that i am anxious ready to be vulnerable i am not sure how to explain it
for all the compliments on my looks and the how could you be single remarks i get i have yet to have an interested party remain interested in me beyond my appearance and physical relationships
lonely i am so lonely i have nobody i am on my own that whole or keep trying is a bit missleading
does anyone have any idea what this could be again no one here can properly diagnose her and i am not trying to diagnose her but i am genuinely just curious
what are some of the coping mechanisms you guys use when you have that moment of acute loneliness the kind that is more intense than your regular everyday loneliness most times i just try and distract myself from the loneliness but at the moment it is quite overwhelming
you were there to stay and build a future family with themyou trusted them yet they took that trust and threw it away like it was nothing
no practically speaking coupling with a partner would not really solve anything entirely he would never say sorry and all i would ever get is uhh i am just a shitty boyfriend
he has locked himself in the bathroom with his gun in the past i do not want to say it but he is aimed it at me in the past
i did not allow you to be part of the process of our relationship the process of building a connection a mutual engagement and communication
and every single time i ended up in a situation where i was about to die i just let it happen before being yanked away by someone else
they both just did not have interest in each other at the end but since i work at chipotle he is a doordasher and comes here very often
grudgebased isolation where someone purposely distances themselves from someone important to their life or society as a whole because they have been disillusioned by them in some way and end up feeling empty without having that presence anymore
people were laughing and having fun with each other but as soon as i was the center of attention the room would go dead silent
he is perceptive so if i forego tacking on handsome to my good morning text he assumes i am in poor spirits however he does not reciprocate in the nickname giving or rather he is inconsistent with it this makes me really anxious and i do not know how to approach it with him
i with all of my neuroses and my turbulent school experiences thought for years that i was the only one who could ever understand my kind of loneliness it was relatively recently when i found out about the sasebo slashing a little late i know that i saw someone else who experienced similar circumstances fucked up as it is i could have easily become girl a if i had not directed all of my pain inwards
after that her dad texted me that she is in a mental hospital without a phone and thanked me again and that she would text me soon she did and she thanked me for saving her life i told her not to worry about it and that i loved her everything looked a little bit better she even found a new girl she liked
i am a 23 year old woman who is struggling with loneliness that is causing my mood to keep dropping my mood has been so bad recently that i have had to stay at my mums house because i am having thoughts of self harm while i am at my own place i do not feel quite like myself
shaking like a god damn iceberg is about to fall apart sobbing and screaming like someone is cutting your heart out
yeah there is people i hang out with but i was never invited to the sleepovers no one asked what i was doing after school and i got over it
i have no idea why this happens are they afraid of me and my change in life do i do something i am not aware about that discourage them to talk to me maybe i am more closed now and focused on myself but i do not thing so i talk as much as before not much at all but i believe it is not that bad i just have nothing to say most of the time in my opinion
i would go out to have dinner at my favourite restaurant alone but enjoyable but we are in lockdown i gave up the struggle probably if i did not maybe i could be in a different situation
she hopefully does not move all the way out there with him thinking she is the one like he promises every woman he dates
but i realized it is better to just end everything once and for alli am so hurt right nowi just need help to get me through this phase
not a single one i gained a porn addiction very quickly and am still far far from getting anywhere close to beating it
i was so consumed by my thoughts that i did not even pay attention in class much less talk to the people around me
i felt so alone here grieving and many friends suggested i go home to be with my family so i asked my mum about it and she basically said she does not want me to because she just wants to be alone
being the manager on the job i am willing stay to finish everything up at the end of the day and am the last one to leave the job site
she explains that in my past my emotional abusive mother made me create a shelter a protection layer so i would not be affected by her and because of that i was enable to feel emotions
and the constant talk of who died today how and other depressing topics she moved out about six years ago to care for her mother and it is been nice
i feel like there must be something wrong with me at this point why does not anyone want me in their life it seems as if everyone already has their crowd
people seem to react only when your actually going to take your own life they do not hear you until it is too late
he read it and did not say anything that was fine with me i was not expecting a response i just needed to say those things

i have never had any friends at school since childhood i had only one good friend but she left me for others
anyway after 3 years of struggling i reached a point i could not focus and study things became more and more complicated and i could not be up in pair anymore

i am in an endless loop of fucking misery and i can not get out of it all i can do is write about it and hope death takes me instead of having to do it myself one day
i just do not understand he has changed for the worse and it makes me so sad to see his changing behavior and hostility towards me a friend would never do these things but what can i do
specific details of the scenario are lengthy but she basically invalidated condescend and ridiculed me for the first time in my life i told her everything about my struggles in life

i am unsure how to feel or what to do because i do not want to cut her out of my life but also do not feel like getting my emotions played with
but some weeks before we meet his behaviour changed we were not talking as much and i was trying to figure out why
well who would think i am relevant i am not fun to be with not degrading myself or anything it is just how it is
regardless of where i am or what i am doing the only thing i can think about is smashing punching and overall destroying anything and anyone in my sight just the uncontrollable urge to go totally ballistic at the drip of a hat

one time she rang our neighbors door bell at 12am and slept at their house bc she did not feel safe at with her family
the only thing that bothered me all the time and that i thought i will find out one day was what have happened to her at her childhood
not because of the material things that eventually wear away with the changing years and evolving trendsits because you are a hard worker and care about progress

it is been a tough year has not it we have all got something on our minds a family issue friendship issue relationships issue a past mistake etc have you realised the amount of days you have punished yourself you have not given yourself a break people mess up people fail people make mistakes people lose it is a part of life we all go through them

and depending on how the relationship ended the door is not closed like many people claim but what is absolutely true is you should not wait or expect it to return and why focusing on personal growth is even more important is that for the relationship to rekindle and be successful you need to work on the aspects of yourself that led to the breakup in the first place

he was kind of picked on in school and i am sure that played into his confidence a bit he never worked at a job that paid much either
it is there and i am just looking at the same metro passing through the distance and i am sure i will break out crying if i play the song
i think of taking my life even when i tell my sister of course i love myself when she says i am selfish when i tell her she has to pay me back
calling someone gives me anxiety when i do not feel 100 comfortable that the other person really wants to hear from me
and to think that i have probably contributed at least a little towards that kind of slutshaming and degrading of another human being for just living their life kills me inside
i have not had a breakdown in a while but its good to let it all out sometimes i do not know why i brokedown maybe girl stuff maybe the current situation of being in lockdown maybe just being in a bad mood i do not know
nobody needs me in their lives nobody cares the only emotion i felt recently is me being pissed off and annoyed at certain things but that is it
i am not posting this for people to read just to get this off my chestso i just made this account to join a community like this i am 19
she shared these insecurities with him and the fear that she would never find anyone who truly cared about her and he shared with her the issues with his relationship as a lot of long distance relationships do and they would always encourage each other
she told me how much she loved me and how she just needed to get over her depression on her own and that she still wanted to get back with me when she can actually feel good again
no education low wage job 18yo living with parents what do i do next either get into a new school or get a standard job what did i do again nothing
i am way behind on my mortgage hoping that between my stimulus check and tax returns i can catch up and get back on top of things
i am visiting home for the holidays i quarantined before i came home and while i had heard from my mom how bad she had become i did not actually realize it till i got back
my ex gf and i were always better friends than lovers and i accepted that but i missed her daughter so badly but i did not want to ruin my chance at being happy so i gave that up
i was ready i loved her the amount of shock and fear i experienced that night was probably more than i ever had before
it was a really tough breakup and i was so depressed over it for a very long time to the point where i would not eat or leave my bed most days and i cut off contact with everyone around me
psychologists job is to be able to find the issue with your way of thinking and perceiving and help you fix it
when she got on i knew something was up she looked like she wanted to cry i knew what it was before she even said it
8 lately when they appear i just accept them as absolute truths and the worst is that it does not bother me as much as it should i just do not have the energy to fight them anymore or to care about them
getting there was a struggle though i worked jobs that drained me i was abusing substances and i was just tired
just talk to someone in person for half an hour but i do not know where i would go or what to do when i meet them
i have had issues with passive suicidality since childhood but 2020 has nailed the lid in that coffin the world would be better off without me and i would be better off not in this world it is that simple
i used to have alot of friends but i have never felt like i belong around them even though i share some good memories with them
high anxiety and stress always on edge but again as time went on and i had not heard from him the feelings went away
my parents raised me better than that but she would bring the anger out of me i am trying to make sense of all of this mess i need help
my country is in the midst of political turmoil and covid19 prevents me from seeing my family as much its even lonelier than i thought it could be
i need to let this out to you since i never got to say a real goodbye soon you will start to realize it hurts so much less and then you will know you are beginning to heal
still have the blade on my right hand aimed at my left wrist but i still could not do it i am calmed down but exhausted
not because you are popular or because you have swagnot because of the material things that eventually wear away with the changing years and evolving trends
that job was like my last stand it was always hard for me to get a job i do not have a drivers license to get around i have no education and overall my hometown sucks in that department
usually i feel like there are not enough hours in the day to spend with him because he makes me feel so special
like i want to try and be friends or something i can not bring myself to block contacts with him till the end of my semester i had to stay in contact with him because of projects
i hate myself so fucking much i miss every friends that i used to have i feel left out and i know for a fact that nobodyis there for me because nobody cares
in fact whenever he makes some silly social awkward comment he makes his sister would be first to call him out on it and further embarrasses him
the more months passed the more i felt a failure i had to do the same things over and over again i never had a good memory and things do not stick to my memory for long
i have had plenty of girls friends but it is always the same story we go to sleep together and they see my little 4 useless appendage and that is usually the end of it
not their fault it is more a representation of the industry i do not blame them or the industry it is just something that is relatively new and needs more time to properly mature
i do not think its too far of stretch to imagine i begin to get insecure at this point and i begin to slip
i am really starting to hate myself i am a bit lunatic i am kind of strange in a way i do not do things like other people do i have always been this way
i am a male who want to wear jeans and vans but my parents say only girls wear fitting jeans and only ghetto people wear tight jeans
in the morning we talked despite him being hung over if we got better if we focused on ourselves for a bit
anyway think about what is still ahead of you when you are mulling over your grief which is just an intense emotion that like all emotions withers away at some point so let it and leave your fucking ex alone find the answers you seek and the closure you desire within yourself
a week after i got home my biological dad died then a month later my stepdad finally succumbed to the cancer
my advice feel it all you may need to cry it out yell it out write it out exercise it out
i just do not get any of it just bummed today i always carry this feeling of being lonely cast away living a life which is not mine
i just wanted to be there for him i did not need anything else i would cook for 2 hours just to leave at the end of the night after a few hours because i wanted him to rest well
we talked about how she would almost have to move down here with me because i graduated a year before she did and already had a full time job while she was just then going to graduate
really makes you wonder if any of this is worth it suffer so you can suffer some more lateri am starting a job i do not want to do in january so i can get money that i do not want so i can move into an apartment i do not want to move into so i can work some more and just be alone surrounded by people i do not like in a world i do not like
the nights were i am lonely is becoming easier to deal with i have been hanging out with friends more and laughing more than i had in months
when i felt sad it was because something was wrong with my relationship with someone the main point as to why i had not realized it is because i always had people to lean on
i hope this all makes sense i am pretty weird when it comes to this stuff thanks for making it all the way down here
i will note here than i am not an incelsorry for the long post i just want to rant and ask how to go through this
i am 19 n a very social person so the fact that lockdown is almost over in the uk n i have become ill has just made my mood plummet
he kept repeating for me to stop crying until i finally did and we joked a little and he called me princess and said he loved me
your participation would be greatly appreciated and useful in helping to better understand the development and experience of loneliness thank you
so maybe i am needing that special someone more than ever but i feel as if the girls at my school are not the ones for me
same thing when i am studying if she walks in or yells at me from the other room or something boom its over drop all the papers and pencil no more studying frustated anger rage
i finally mustered up my courage to confess it to her and now she is blocked me everywhere she is obviously hurt and i feel like shit i do not know how to forgive myself help i really want to fix this i do not know how
yet again i am so sorry if this comes off as attention seeking i really do not want that to be what you think
i know he must have regrets and i think i know what some of them are again nobody is perfect we are humans i can not imagine living alone without him
i guess i just want someone to give me a better advice guide me on how to finish it or even just a little push
i just want to grieve and get through this i just want to move on from this stage but i have no idea how it is like my brain is trapping me in this feeling because i suppressed grieving for a while and maybe i might not be able to handle this
she had posted a few post not about me or anything although she was singing a song about how someone could say that they loved them but it was an open and closed case i am pretty sure she is happier without me and now i am just not feeling great i thought we worked
i am happy to attend via zoom but it seems a bit intense for a hamster so i wanted to check in that everythings ok with julia hope you had a nice christmas

you do not need to reply no obligations nothing big just a simple message for you personally that will hopefully make you feel a little less lonely hell if we are lucky you might smile about how silly it all is
well we had an on again and off again kind of relationship we met on a app and we hit it off instantly we had a lot of common interest and her birthday was a day before mines we loved each other a lot and had plans to move in together once i graduated from school
i know i am real and this world is real it just greatly does not feel like it and often question it and i am scared that the dream world will become feeling more real and i will get stuck or completely messed up
we were excited to be back together and away from our families lol but then the covid anxiety really started to kick in for me
even though i am redoing this year of trainingaccording to google translator this is the name the people are pretty nice but i again do not know how to approach anyone and my selfdoubt kicks always in and destroys everything
my husband says to get back on facebook but that such a toxic place to be everybody and their fake perfect lives
he was rough had no empaty i felt profondly rejected even though i know i should not take it personnaly but i did
i really hate myself i really really do i see myself as ugly fat and stupid although no person considers that i am that but for me others opinions of me does not matter mine does and i have a veeery poor opinion of myself
for as long as i can remember whenever i have had to deal with something i have had to do it on my own and i have gotten too good at it

she 28f took 12 proceeds from house sale and racked up 30k in credit card debt on their joint credit card no complaint from him
i am pathetic and cowardly too retarded and lazy to jumpstart my life but too scared to kill myself but i really want to die
but no such luck i managed to play cod warzone with 2 of my friends later today but i still feel so empty
i call this kind of perfectionism idiotic perfectionism where there is a constant need to take on an unrealistic project as a coping mechanism to low self worth and not even beginning to work on it sadly
i chose to not tell him the truth because i refuse to relive those times when he did things to me when i clearly said no i did not tell him why because i felt bad for seeing him as the bad guy i never wanted to see him that way ever hence why i chose to leave
i also feel like i might never find someone i loved this deeply i dunno what to do i just i wish that they had not broken up with me part of me feels like this is a nightmare and it did not happen
i am trying to move on and i know staying friends is most likely not helping but i am not ready to lose him yet
he often overdid it and i let it happen for a while i admit i myself overdid it i hate crying
i have tried to really utilize my time by getting into old hobbies and working on self improvement i have been unsuccessful so far
a original topic for loneliness group i am disabled and also living alone with a disability so i have puzzled to ask if you have got unlimited resources would you buy friends to have a social life
like any decent human being who is not a sociopath i have spent the year of the trump virus in selfquarantine never seeing a single good person whose face is not masked all this time and spending christmas alone to ensure my older relatives live to see another christmas
i did not tell her about my depression that i had for 6 years because i was scare about what she could think about me
it definitely hurts my feelings because we broke up to have a better friendship and i feel like the last few days i have been pretty much alone
but he would still get jealous each time i met with him and told me i need to let him know before i meet him anytime
i have had problems in the past with wanting to end things and i am not suicidal but if really rather not live my life feeling like this
i have a dead end job and i am the only one from my group who managed to keep the job somehow they hired a lot of new people and i do not like anyone
but now i can confidently say that i hate her there is nothing to love about her and no one else in my family can admit that i hate her just like i hate my dad it should not matter to them because they care about no one but themselves
i do not know what illness i have but one day my mom talked to a doctor on the phone and they think i have pcos
i grew up bipolar so i understood a thing or two about mental illness but i was never sure what was up with her
my fat ass gets dragged into eating it so that my family thinks that i am okay they are going to be an online couple from now on
a lot of dates have been one or twooffs but that is because the idea of me is more appealing than the reality of me
i grabbed the garden hose and taped it shut onto the exhaust then ran it into the window and taped the rest
struggling trying to balance safety and sanity my wife almost left me because everything is just so stressful now i feel like a burden
she was tired of waiting for me to be open deal with me shit and be as 100 into her as she was into me
but i know i need to be honest with myself that i miss you a lot i feel it in every fiber of my being i miss everything i can recall about you i have dated other people before you but this is the first time i miss someone this much it hurts not an obsession just a deep longing for you
my face felt like it was pulsing and expanding like i could feel myself turning red then a loud ringing in my ears drowning out everything else
although he said he considers me an ex he met a girl that lived much closer only 20 min away instead of 22 hours
just as we do not try to stop or hold onto clouds as float past we allow our thoughts to enter our awareness and then pass through
the next morning when we woke up i started to clean and i asked her if she could take the laundry later when she had a chance
things like his grandpa making weird jokes about him having sex with his own mother and his mother telling him about how her new husband has gotten a happy ending at asian massage parlors and asking him if he would accept one right in front of me
i started cymbalta in october and by last week i was in full blown seretonin syndrome and knew i needed help
i have been feeling so much lack of love these past few months it has been so rough i feel like i need to rebuild my tiny broken heart piece by piece although i am alone now surrounded by memories of our love here in the place we used to live in together
everyone else seems so happy and i always just kept hope that one day that would be me but i really do not think that happiness is out there for me anymore
i wanted to get surgery to change it change my face my skin color my name every single thing about me i want to change i think about it everyday i think of so many fake names to call myself names i wish i was born with
just this morning he apologized for putting me through all of this he looks at our pictures together before going to bed and probably feels sad what is going on i am so confused
and i guess i will forever have to live with that fact and reality even though i wish it was not true and wish we could have worked out and continued to progress together
stanning celebrity was the only thing that made me happy but now i do not even have the energy to do it
hiya names niko today i understood how big of a deal is loneliness when you feel nostalgic warmth although you want to tear up i remembered how good it is to have a girl who is your partner in joy and sorrow how good it is to be in her arms after hard work day and now there is a black hole in my heart and my soul
i can not close my eyes without opening them again and the only way i fall asleep is by getting too tired
the problem is the job does not really pay me enough to be able to take care of us and the extra stuff i would need to start gaining weight only in terms of food other expenses are taken care of this is why he has decided to tell me to do my thing and not worry about him and that he will get food from his family
there is something wrong with me and i can not fix why i feel this bad however when i do i just feel inclined to go back
tonight me and my ex were trying to play nice and hang out to which we started arguing and then it led to us talking about our break up
she kept smoking and one morningshe set herself on fire while smoking with her oxygen on she inhaled fire and ended up burning her throat and she needed a ventilator to breathe
i am trying my best to help her with anything an understanding that her body just did magical things that i will never feel my body do an give birth to beautiful baby
the reason was that he got bored of the relationship and wanted to see what is out there that was a red flag but he told me he lost feelings even before the break up
yes i did go to several psychologists and also took for a period some antidepressants but they did not do much
one day we chatted over messenger all day tho maybe i keep it going too long am too eager to talk
my boyfriend and best friend supported me to see a therapist because i just was not in good shape i used to think all i was what people did to me
after that they will probably try to send you a text like literally sayingyou know why they sent you this why they did not even call you
i just keep picturing myself middle aged and coming home from a deadend job to an empty house because my parents will be gone by that time and i do not have any siblings going to bed and waking up alone and then just doing it all over again
i do not know when i will not be lonely anymorei can feel my loneliness get worse day by day and drag me deeper into an empty cave
i always wanted a relationship with a girl and to experience genuine intimacy i do not like the idea of casual sex and i do not want us to be a friends with benefits
i heard someone say that your most apprehended and safe memories are the ones that you do not recallthe ones you do not even try to remember or imagine them happening again
i do not have much time to type so i will cut to the chase i am feeling depressed tonight and sketched a drawing of me strangling someone no one in particular so i just labeled the victim as everyone
i only know of one called chillpsych it is really nice but quite small they also have a twitch stream that i really enjoy watching every night since it is just a guy playing games with his friends and interacting with like 23 viewers in the chat i would love to interact with more people in that chat tho
i have stopped missing her the way i used to where i would burst into tears everytime i would think of her
instead of telling yourself i am unlovable you can tell yourself things like i am not perfect but i am lovable and enough
i also recently found out that is she is been hearing voices and idk how to deal or cope with any of these things and fuck i have no hope
i have ran out of contrived purposes and struggles to distract myself with what is the solution to my suffering according to the psychologists
known as harass till i collapse from all of the fucking hees sorry for it probably so just leave me fucking be
so we basically claimed each other and confirmed we were dating she apparently is taking it slow because she just got out of our relationship
no job no money basic education shity family living at my parents house dunno what is wrong with me because i can not find any motivation to get a job or start living
i do not want to believe it because i am so used to having her i knew someday she would die and i knew it would be a problem
my future exboy friend and i are spending the last moments together in our flator did a new world start when this universe start
i feel really bad for her and it is not really her fault i just do not think we click as much as she thinks we do
like in school for an example i went to study something that i do not enjoy cuz i literally did not have a choice but i had to choose something there is literally nothing for me to study nothing i enjoy nor want to work towards i can not take a year off either to just think what i want to do
i really need a hug right now i rarely get any hugs from anybody but when i do it takes my loneliness away for that moment
many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help a couple of key points to keep in mind
sometimes i get ideas that she is out cheating on me although she never has or i get really upset when i do not hear from her fast enough
i bore my fathers judgement and withstood his homophobia for you i believed you could do no wrong that you were a saint
could anyone tell me what are small things you are ex parters did that made you want to break up with them i was thinking that maybe if i did some things i could make him break up with me and get it over with
i know i am a fool for ever taking her back the first time but i just love her that much that i allow her to walk all over me
my parents act like they want me here but it is only because it is so they do not have to answer questions from others when i do not show
its been 2 months since i have interacted with other people besides my mom and obviously my dealer i still have that mentality 18 is coming faster than i expected as i am turning 17 next month
the only thing keeping me here is a fear of what is on the other side i am planning on finally ending it next week
the break up and the second attempt which is about the substitution to get over the break up led me to better rediscover myself i got that i need someone not from my country or someone who wants to leave my country as much as i do
a few months ago he had decided he should take a break from it for at least a month to see how he felt
i will break random shit because i am so mad at myself and think i just do not deserve it society associates these things like cutting with the it is just a phase emo kids
i am constantly paranoid on edge and anxious i feel like everyone is out to get mea few days later my ex was extremely apologetic and she was undergoing mental breakdowns and panic
there is this girl that i know from high school that i have had a crush on but for some reason i do not think i like the way i perceive her personality so i am not sure about her but still better than none if not her i will try cold approaching
the thing that is not ok is i still resent and still can not accept is the fact that back then i never had any hope anymore any feelings or even thought to find connection with someone again until he made me
so me 16 and my boyfriend 16 broke up a little over 3 weeks ago because of the stress of online school and because we were both busy which made each other unhappy
a doctor spents half his life studying working and getting his license just to be able to diagnose you who is suffering with the right mental illness
i just do not know what to do whenever i get into moments like this i just can not think of any options to move forward
she told me that i will die alone and that i am an ungrateful manipulative mentally ill female and that is why i do not have and will never have any real friends
so we started to see each other more and also told me that he wanted to give us a try again until he started to see another girl let us call her liz he told me liz was also a friend and that i really should not worry about her
to be short 2 years ago i was divorced single motherhe said he could not see me as much anymore but that he did not want to end things
going to wait until closer to new years i had the needle of insulin in my hand ready ro inject my friend talked me out of it but barely
am i losing it if so how do i find a good doctor am i just drunk if so how do i stop drinking
why is this so i am single yes i have not made any efforts to see someone because i do not want to run away from these feelings i am fearful of ending up with a wrong person yes sometimes but i seek connection and love
i know all that information may have seemed pointless but what are the chances you guys think she will want me back i want to move on and be successful while also partying and meeting new people to show her what she missed out on but i also miss her so bad
since then i have been messaging him for a week straight bc i thought i could change his mind about his stance
i struggle with some depression and anxiety for like 4 years and i have been taking light anti depressants as well
i am a teen i dunno if there are any rules against posting because of that i read the rules and it said nothing about that but anyway here is my question
and i realize that i can not be sad about life i can not be sad about a guy who did not want to be with me
it is not something i can describe but i can try my best to elaborate in the comments i am 16 years old i do not want to feel like this my whole life
so now i know there are many words that kind of represent a little bit about who i am maybe probably this has helped me to realize that i do not trust in my own understanding of what romance is so here is my question to anyone who feels like they want to help here
not sure if this is the right place for this but here goesi have always been a lonely person never really had any friends or felt like i belonged anywhere
if i could take a magic painless pill to stop existing right now i would do it before i finish typing this post
i am feeling so very stuck and i do not know what to do if i did leave i am afraid of what he would do
i just do not want to feel this pain anymore i can not believe i let something like this affect me so much i feel so weak and pathetic i am even thinking about getting professional help i feel so scared anxious and sad it is been affecting my work my friendships and my family i just feel so lost yet i just want him back
think of using meditation to help with anxiety but when anxiety resurfaces you get more anxiety of failing to meditate properly which makes it much harder to do
i know that for many people finding friends can be difficult and finding true friends even morebut we are all diferents and we all have differents reason to say that
i know what is posted on social media is only a small my family are supportive and i am generally a happy person yet still i have severe anxiety
hi guys recently my partner and i have been having a lot more arguments and although i have not noticed it until pointed out i have also been snapping at others my parents for example in situations that really do not warrant it
to everyone out there struggling right now please remember it is just another day the same as the previous day and the same as the next day we are all in this together and we need to do what is best for us during tough times
uggghhhh that or i want to kill people i wish i could get this rage out and throw it all at someone
one time i saw liz at his house i live near by and the same day i heard that lisa stayed the night
idk how to explain it but our lifestyles matched we liked doing the same things not going out not very social etc
i understand everyone has their issues and it is their life but just how many times should i ask for support it hurts at times
we lived together just over two years we knew we wanted to get married but i did not think we were in a hurry
what happened to me today was quite shocking because it never happened beforei had a nightmare but not like all of the ones i have been having this one is different
when i reached out with a big thank you she just says np hope you enjoyi send a big thank you to her friend and i get a long reply
i do not hate my family but we have many differences and i want to live my own life we used to live on our own but due to personal circumstances we came back to my family house it seems it was a mistake
stuff like that except not just that my whole life basically revolves around the trauma i experienced five years ago it follows me everywhere
ignores my feelings and tells me that my feelings are just because my dad turned me against her and that i do not actually feel that way and then wonders why still selfharm and i am still depressed and want to die it does not matter how many times i tell her it has nothing to do with my dad
i feel like i can not say anything can not talk can not be myself around them no matter how much i want to when the situation comes i can not say anything
he has said that i am like family and that we will always be friends sounds cheesy but i think i am okay with it
i broke up with my partner at the start of the year after they were getting increasingly angrier i still stuck with living with them even so i have been stupid enough to continue seeking affection and attention because i have no one else especially during the pandemic
an example is that we would always go out to party or eat and get drunk and spend a lot like sometimes it can reach up to a 100 or 200 dollars on a single night
i could solve the problem of how to actually accomplish the above despite living in a house that had such toxic atmosphere which i hated so fucking very much
all my best friends from the past 10 years are men i have never had any romantic interest in them and they have never in me at least that i know of
the last time the woman i loved said it would not work out was because she shared her past with a relative of mime
she told me she would but she just became so comfortable in me carrying the weight and now that i was broken and hurt she just basically let it die
she has talked with some healthcare workers and have told me several times she does not like talking to them because she feels every time she is talking to them it is like an interview where they ask a question and she gives a short reply which continues for the whole duration of their talks
i missed out on a lot of family gatherings as a child because my family is small and spread out all over canada
while at the movies we saw an old couple watching all cuddled under a blanket having a fun time you told me that is what you want at the end of the day
i feel so stupid for wanting to live everything is just so weird because i know i will not feel this way in a few hours
i have been feeling like shit for the past few days and i just need someone to talk to i have only been watching the comedy series like friends modern family etc with my meals
for everyone saying i should go to therapy i did comment about it to one person but i guess i will put it up here so everyone can see i have been in therapy for most my life and have been doing 3 kinds of it in the last year or so i have got that covered but it is just still so hard yea i have got about 6 trained psychologists psychiatrists and clinical therapists on my team that i can talk to but i do not know what they can do to helpsupport me
i really would have wanted to do something so that i would have been wrong about what i was imagining if that makes sense
i had past relationships as a teenager and had gone trough breakups but this time is different because i really thought we would marry and have a family and end up together
sure i talk to friends are they really during school but i feel as if all of them forget that i exist after that no let us hang out no how are you doingnothing
lately i noticed a sort of constant numb state like i am not present in the moment like i am an observer and not really living my own life
she had left saying that i could not give her the happiness she wanted and that i could not give anything at all
but in the end every time i have been telling to myself let us just try again you can always give up if you want it will take less than a minute the windows right there just a step and all the pain will be gone forever
i get that these mental health troubles and other repercussions of the pandemic are not easy and very new to many people but at the same time i wonder whether these reactions are authentic or exaggarated
i would spend nights reading her books as we fell asleep and so did she we would take nerdy courses on learning how to learn and organize exam tests for each other to pass we would build castles out of sheets and read each other the kabbalah or the quran so we would grow with god
i realize something i can do right now is hold space for people of all communities dialoguing about our grief and mortality which makes perfect sense because that is kind of my specialty and seems to be in great need right now
they did also hit me sometimes and some time after i did not even remember why i was punished i do not remember very much things of my childhood and that is another thing that hurts me
i was totally in the wrong but this was the day i saw coming when i suggested we do anger management and couples therapy
i have a really successful career i am mentally strong most of the time i am a tall skinny japanese i help people with all my might
i understand that it is not her fault and i am not mad at her but the whole situation can be extremely frustrating
the issue here is that the last interpersonal relationship i have form was from 9 years ago with my wife in 9 years i have have not make new friends in person the reason behind this is because the cultural gap between them and i let me define cultura gap
i met her in my grad school cohort and it started really rocky that is hurts lately he went out with another girl
i have tried a few months ago i ended up taking around 14g of modified release paracetamol of course some of the ache is still there he was my first love
mainly talking to girls to try and gain someone in my life and now that i have the opportunity too i am afraid because i have no comfort zone to run to when i feel like things are getting tough or wearing a burden on me
unfortunately i could not change that about myself as of yet who knows maybe someday i willthis christmas confirmed it i am so excruciatingly exhausted
i talk to people online but it is not the same as having a connection irl i help everyone i can to be happy however i can but i cannot help myself for some reason
i do not feel like living thank you if you read the entire thing i wish you the best in life good luck
my dad just came into my room asking why i always seem to get angry for no reason and that it is making them feel bad all the time
as much as i want the best for him and as much as i want to support him on his transition which i think is honest i can not get over this gut feeling of not trusting him
i know she can not be always there for me to talk it helped me a lot when she used to but truth to be told she has dated 3 guys since and it did not worked out for first 2 guys and she entered 3rd relationship
i am sick of this shit and i can not wait to fucking get out of here i am tired of sympathising and feeling bad for her thinking i need to help and fix people
we became official within 2 or 3 weeks and could both honestly tell the other i love you within a month and a half
i just want to be dead so badly it hurts my chest hurts so much i feel like i could throw up
at times tim acts really unnatural like he wants others to acknowledge his creative and quirky nature and most of the classmates really like him at this point i like him to i am a little weirded by some behavior but overral we have some fun talk
much love david ruiz pacheco 12291997 admittedly i was really hot headed and all over the place but it still stung in the end
i have made a couple good friends in the last couple years so it feels a little easier now but it is not just about the friendships
it was a bit of a shock because although my gut told me it was going to happen i had convinced myself i was wrong as he did not do it in person
he thinks that my job is easy then he sent me a long text back and this is a big part of it
this shit sounds painfulthat is the only part of my plan that i am incredibly uneducated aboutwe just broke up 2 months back after a 3 year relationship 25m 25f she was my college friend
she is freaking out and i do not know how to help her she never begs me for anything and right now she is begging me
i have wasted so much time on making my family hate me i have wasted so much money on things that do not matter i have wasted so much energy on people who will take me for granted and then just stop caring i do not want to wake up tomorrow i just do not
i tried to leave as quickly as possible and just agree with him but for some reason that made him even more mad
she was cold and explained she and he rarely fought and if they did it was civil and resolved they were a much better match she explained
i wish he could still be in my life but i also resent him and do not want to talk to him at all because of it
i told her it was hurting me and hurting us and she said she understood i texted her on the 7th telling her i needed a break and i could not keep doing this it took her nearly 20 days to respond saying she wanted to call and work things out which i had suggested in my last message
just a quick note to ask you to hurry up with the divorce you are the one wanting it so i need you to hurry up on it so it can be my turn to meet someone i am going to wait unlike you i can wait
i want him to make it right but i do not know if he will ever be able to he is telling me now that he finally has an appointment set up with that therapist he wanted
i am not sure if it is the best way forward but it is seems better then all the other options that i have
i also snooped through his email he left logged in on my phone and found he reconnected with another ex while we were broken up and i reached out to her thinking that is who he was talking to she confirmed she was not and he messed up her life when they were involved and just dipped out on her
i was taking them in combination with an adhd medication i was also prescribed i continued to take the adhd medication after i stopped the bipolar ones
she is going through a hard depression i have been trying to hold her off from that but so far i am not being successful
he was not taking me to places and when he would he wanted to leave i remember myself crying in our small hotel room saying that i need somebody to love me
i thought about going back to dating apps today i never had any luck on dating apps and deleted them all probably around five years ago i hated judging people much more than knowing they were judging me does anyone else feel that way about dating apps
i felt that my productivity would be aided by a small laptop that i could carry around the house to keep work with me if i walked away from my gaming laptop which i use as a desktop and is too cumbersome to carry around
i tried to express certain fears and issues and she kept chalking it up to my anxiety despite knowing i had other diagnoses adhd
i want to tell her i still love her but i am worried this will make her take a step back from our friendship
and she as perfect as she may think she is it will only be a matter of time before something is nitpicked
she felt that once again i saw her as a who are and that i did not respect her it had gone too far and not long after she broke up with me
some people i trusted were seeing me as a damn clown or an obsessive girl simping on a boy i had no chance to get
i do not know if is good of bad for my mental health that boderns me a lot so i request your helpful advice i will appreciate it a lot thanks
idk why maybe because i was already stressed about my math exercises but when the intercome the man was already here just a few seconds after my mom called sounded i broke down and i started crying
i feel like i might have a mental illness of some sort as i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 6 months ago
todays been surprisingly good i left a message on our log telling you about it but i do not think you have seen it
i bought numbing cream and all i am waiting for is it to get here this would be the second time id have tried
i also asked a girl who i was talking to out for a drink and she left me on read i would have accepted the no and during this i have social anxiety and anger issues due to my autism
just assume i am telling the truth both my face and name are anonymous and this is not exactly a good look i really wanted to use this reddit account to post out of context photos but sadly i discovered reddit close to the time i lost my mind
she was talking negatively and making this whole situation about herself i told her to basically shut up and i refrained from insulting her or saying anything rude
i do not even want to get married to someone i do not like but they will probably make me since nobody in this world likes me
in the first week or two i was sad of course but relieved i asked it the same question today it said you were all you
i am just afraid that now it is too late he owns his own house and took down everything of us
am i crazy for thinking this and that him getting upset over a text was just an excuse how does one throw away 2 years and us trying to build us again for someone 13 years younger than him
i recently discovered my friend has anxiety and i want to know what she goes through thanks in advancehi a friend of mine i struggling with anxiety and panic attacks including hyperventilating
she also became really distant she did not really hug or kiss me that often any more and we stopped having sex
i want to thank anyone who took the time to read this and sorry if this was a bit too long but i felt like this was the only website in which i could get some decent info on it
does anyone have any tips on how to make meaningful friendships apparently i am horrible at it i am feeling extremely lonely lately i just wish i had a couple deep friendships to make me feel more complete because my importance has begun to feel very meaningless
stay the fuck away from me but i got annoying and she got mad and she blocked me on everything i wad devastated again
anyway ever since he is messaged me i have had this sick feeling of possibility and desire to get back with him its driving me insane constantly having to consider the option and that the fact this is the only time i will get the option it will not happen twice
we are both 15 so we can not afford them ourselves i am not mad and i am not angry at you i am just so sad
but i noticed how everyday at some point i would tell myself how it would be better to die at that moment
my body is frail and my kidneys hurt the past 30 hours or so has been hell i have to get up now though as i am in danger of dehydrating badly
i do not know how to start conversations with people either i am likeable but not at the same time he is the love of my life then we would just would hug and lay there until you felt better
some context i am agender living in mexico asexual past 30 tonight i am having dinner with friends dressing up to make myself feel good
my parents have always been disappointed in me as they are christian and they have resented me for being atheist since the day i told them of my beliefs
i am in my mid 40s i am married own a home have smart and healthy kids and i own my own business
it is so important to clearly write down what went wrong could be events could be a moment an interaction could be the way they treated you
i was able to be a bit more honest with some people always will but just like today he came over and he uses messenger
the problem is the morbid curiosity i have i usually end up doing this for a bit and then stop for a long period of time but sometimes i can not help but want to watch like graphic videos of real life deathinjury not because i necessarily enjoy it but i just can not help but look further
depression i just feel sad not for any particular reason i think this is maybe because by my negative overthinking
i have lost all of my friends because nobody believed me and they all wanted to be friends with him still because it was easier for them to just be friends with him and pretend like nothing happened than to admit that i was raped repeatedly and controlled for years
little things set me off and i am tired of feeling this weird hurt in my gut i am sick of getting offended by everything because they do not know what i am going through
she went into some kind of stupor then she told me things would only be worse for her if i left
in second grade i got a cat for going to the dentist and named her fishin my language it sure does sound cooler
drawingi can not bring myself to do this anymore i just do not have the energy for it a groupchat i am in they are all super supportive and nice best people online that i know
i still think about the times we danced in the kitchen kissed in the rain and i definitely still think about how your bed will always be more comfortable than mine
i plan to slit my wrist with the bowie knife i keep by me bed and to end it all off i have got an edible that will completely knock me out
break ups can actually be one of the hardest emotions that we go through and sometimes that emotion can be compared to that of loss
one that i should end my life because i am angering god here on earth but god will not end my life for he is just but the voice says if i truly love god i should have ended my life sooner
i have just a few friends literally never had a girl i am always struggling at conversations with anyone and here comes the problem
i burnt many bridges and was always alone on the internet gain lots of weight and barely passed my courses i started drinking and smoking
i do not abuse my kids and i would never harm them in any way but i get so angry and mean
when we meet tomorrow if she does not break up with me i am going to break up with her it is honestly stupid now that i look back but she cheated on me 4 times and i was so stupidly blinded that i did not leave her only comfort her about her negative thoughts of herself afterwards
however i found out this week that my ex has started seeing someone else your break up does not have to break you heartbreak does not have to break you and actually it can not
i do not want to live but i also do not want to die i am in this push and pull where i do not know what to do
i am still not surrounded by people that care i am still alone and most of the time i do not know and do not remember who i am
i have had a seriously strong hatred toward her ever since last year when she hurt me i have basically been obsessed with wanting to hurt her mentally andor physically
i can understand high school being that but it then happened at work then university which i left after one year and then community college
about two months ago i started to have my depression and stuff just rush back to me and i have realized that i need help its just my mind and body refuse to ask anyone for help is this common or has anyone felt this or am i just a new kind of insane
with all that being said i have told myself for years now that i would not live past 18 i normally used to reply trying to spark conversation but she does not
my grades are dropping and i have no motivation to study or anything so i am worried i will lose my scholarship my parents can not afford to keep me at that school if i lose it and they compare me a lot to some of my other more successful friends
we have had lengthy discussions in the past as i have tried meds and therapy for my mental health and my family are fortunate enough to not suffer with mental health issues on level with mine
work empty room work empty room work empty room add some beer every now and then sometimes weeks sometimes months work empty room work empty room work empty room what the fuck
are some of these things fine and normal like is it normal to have a hallucination out of nowhere and then not have any significant hallucinations afterwards just sometimes thinking i see things in my periphery or hearing alarms that are not there
i can sit on the computer or stare at my phone without this feeling because then i will see the notificaitons right away if they come i can watch tv or play a game because i sort of get lost in those and forget my worries for a bit that is not what i want to do though i want to work on something engaging or play games with my kids but it is so difficult and exhausting
why is this happening i cry uncontrollably and have fallen into depression so bad i am not taking care of myself anymore
and we hope to receive 1000 submissions for this dataset to better research loneliness we will be posting the submissions anonymously on our online gallery and social media
i am just hating my life i am losing my motivation to be healthier i meditate and workout but today and yesterday i have not worked out i do not feel like meditating and when i do meditate i feel so distracted in my thoughts i do not know how to make it stop
i still do care about her it is just trash man i just sad about this and i do not know what to do about it
so my question is how do i go about this in the best way possible unfortunately the breakup will not be mutual she very obviously still really likes me so i will not expect this to be easy at all
i broke up with him because of his behavior and after he cheated then i graduated and moved away to live with family
all of this ties in to the feelings of loneliness and feeling alone ties in to a deep setting emotion that we allowed to rule over us and dominate the positive will we possess
my wife has now attempted to take her life six or seven times in the last 8 monthsi felt her slipping and then one night in january 31st she just never came home

which was most of the day lol conscious mind can do that tho but what can i do about all the dreams
i like done fought with my bf because he helps finically it is not enough for me when i was little i did not now it but i had a pretty messed up childhood
i love my other friends but i just do not have a person like an anchor and i guess that is why i have been feeling so lonely in the city
he visited my country again met my family everything was great i went to his country met his family and everything was also great
after we had sex literally laying together after he tells me about this girl he used to have a crush on who he dropped after finding out she slept with 8 men across a twoyear span i got insecure and admittedly asked for a little too much reassurance that i was accepted about a month later something snapped in him
sometimes not even momentarily which brings us back to the point what is a perfect gift the one that makes someone permanently happy
i am on antidepressants but i keep reading they should help with cognition and they are not whatsoever i am depressed and i have panic disorder alot of anxiety and also dealing with all the extended side effects from that it is a struggle and i wish i just would get some solid advice what to do from this point
like when you have a nightmare someone dies and you wake up and try to imagine what it would be like if they actually died but you can not feel any grief because you know they are not actually dead
i honestly do not know what to do i keep trying to fight back saying that i do not want to die that i still have things to offer for this world and it for me but maybe i am just stalling and it is my cue to kick the bucket
she basically talked about wanting to have kids early and getting married i kind of liked the idea of sharing my life with someone this early because i am so lonely so i was blinded by all the red flags
so my ex who broke up with me texted me she said that she is sorry for everthing and that type of stuff
i will be there to care for you when your not well and help you get bettershe wanted to remain friends i said yeah
my life was not so great though i started cutting myself but putting up a smile to my sister and her newborn child
on monday i am planning on giving my therapist a letter that explains a lot of what i have not told her and i really do think it is a huge step for me the issue is that it is in 5 days and i feel incredibly restless because of excitement anxiety and just wanting to get it over with anybody else experience this any ideas on how to handle it
i tend to also catastrophise the smallest thoughts into big scary manifestations its crippling i can not distract myself from these thoughts and even playing my favourite game will not even satisfy me
i am currently at a pizza joint giving myself another cheat day instead of running feeling a tad happier now being alone can not wait to eat
but the damage was already done she gave into lust and had an affairsince i can not say it to him i leave it here not doing well tonight
i am so proud to be the person putting that beautiful smile on your face i love you so much and i love you so much more every single day
this is the second time she has done it we have been dating for 4 years and around 2 years without interruption this time
for the last how many months she can get close to me at stages and one moment she can be talking good with me and being so comfortable and talking about personal stuff and then 2 minutes later she can just change and make it as if she is so uncomfortable with me and she does not know me
i applied to lots of companies for internships but got rejected because of my relatively low gpa and yes i am dissapointed but in the end i realize that i am above this i can not keep wasting my time being sad
i love making beats and overall listening to music i am very determined that i will become an impactful music producerartist in the future
i will feel a bump on my skull and think i have a brain tumor when it is really just the shape of my head
oddly this fixation on laptops is not found elsewhere in my behaviours i have a state of the art smartphone from 2016 and i just had the battery replaced so it can hopefully go another four years i drive a car that is from 2002 and always let my mechanic handle all the work i am not qualified to do
my first semester of college was inperson and i finally started to make a few good friendships i feel i will never be happy
the same thing happens in almost every effort to imagine something i am currently trying to imagine a man scoring a football goal but when i do my brain creates an invisible film on the goal or the ball misses or the goal distorts
i fucking tried everything that the internetfriends have literally fucking told me to do change jobs change myself change my environment be more positive
since there is covid i can not see my friend life is so boring i am in my room all day thinking about him and crying and doing school stuff i need advice i feel like i am going crazy
why do i feel awkward when someone tries to show love and affection to me awkward in a sense that i get irritated and try to distance people who try to show love or affection to me
take today like any day and be a little selfish do what you desire give yourself some love and do anything that gives you a little life and love
it just hurts hearing negative things your whole life because it makes you doubt yourself i just want to hear one time i believe in you
i am in school studying software engineering and finance while in the military reserves one can not afford to stay drunk or high all of the time anyway
what i wish for more than anything is the assurance that my life will be good one day and that i will be good enough
i wanted to start off by saying that i am not a medical doctor and i am not trying to diagnose her and no one on reddit can diagnose her and she needs to get help with an official diagnosis from a dr i am genuinely am just curious
i hear it is incessant call on my flesh and wants of having a family the thought of getting up and putting in effort to socialize is overwhelming but i feel so lonely
i am sorry if this has a lack of cohesive questioningpoint just today after getting my ps4 fixed i saw how i still had him as a friend and it brought back all the memories and i just want to know if it ever goes away
and whatevers going down will follow you around that is how you fight loneliness you laugh at every joke drag your blanket blindly

eat healthy today now workout out and stretching building a healthy environment of the people around me getting rid of people that just using me
his family and extended family would label him as the uptight cousin because of the way my he behaves around them
so i did not ask any questions though i wanted to be i could not be an interactive studentwhat symptomes should i look for how to recognise mental ilness
these shits might stay for a while yet good things do exists there are so many possibilities in this world and what you can do is be open to that
i was a very consistent weed smoker and would go to my supplier everyday i was abusing it like crazy and that is what i think started all this
that my friends call me to hang out instead of calling me to help them with homework i not at home playing video games
we are good the ending was peaceful we are not mad at each other but i am still willing to text her because we are best friends even before we started dating
i have encountered this with managers especially to the point where i have changed dramatically as a person and i do not take praise well from anyone even at home and i half expect to be yelled at for something
i do not even have enough money to pay rent at the end of this month so i am wondering if it is even worth it to live that long
he wants to be friends but i can not help thinking of him with other girls and it pisses me off i can not deal with him with another girls i have been asked out a lot but i keep canceling because i do not want to be with anyone but him i know we do not have a future as a couple but it is killing me to think of my life without him
on the lessons like math physics where you solve problem i could not solve them i did not know how to solve them
to save myself pain writing out all the details in short sum i was told my friends to stop talking to him but i never did
i had a shit day at work because of incompetent coworkers and came home to kind of cry it off with him then when i was done he gave this long speech of just him beating around the bush of how i needed to focus on myself and my future and he knew from experience that that is easier to do while single so he basically said we are on a break but also were not were just broken up and it really hurts and i do not know what to do because he was the man that i was planning on marrying
i have never had someone make me something for me so personalized and with so much thought and love put into it
i massively overreact tell her its over only to realise my mistake and say let us talk about it again when she gets home
like some couples in my country i work like far away from her so we having a ldr but sometimes i take time to surprise her by going home etc
it is weird some days i am okay and think i will be totally fine and will live an amazing life then there are days where i do not leave my bed and when i am okay again i get upset with myself that i did nothing that day or was rash and contacted him
often times i would stay longer than even the managers would there were 2 managers in particular who talked down to me and treated me like garbage
i love you so fuing much baby and i will never ever leave youyes she said that to me 24 hours before dumping me and burning me to the ground
i am not strong enough to keep doing this on my own i have been running on empty for so long and i just am burnt out
i did 25 years of a degree i do not even want trying to convince myself all the time that this was what i wanted all of this wasted time with a dead soul
i was in a terrible state for a while and i was sure that he would come back to me since he was still unsure if he made the right decision if i just
we usually always hang out at night but she did not want me to even be with her while he is there
buti could never shake a lingering feeling that we were not meant to be and that i felt 80 in love sometimes 60 in love for moments 100 but usually it always scaled back i usually shrugged it off to insecurity and normal doubts and that was ok while spending time together was cool she was supportive of my grandfathers passing my dog passing away strong memories and slowly started to project our future together
when i went back home i mustered up all my courage to tell my mom about this i went to her room and she jokingly replied you are out of your mind
ultimately i just need to be told i am the good guy that i did not because the breakup that it was her just not knowing what she wanted with uni and drugs
i love him with my whole heart and soul and it was such a genuine love i have never felt like how i felt with him before
covid really put pressure on our relationship so we were constantly fighting i am very dazed and feel like i am just going through life without thinking
she even told me that i can date other girls or guys if i want to for me to forget her
i think this is why i am fucked up rn cuz she started separating from me slowly months ago but all she had to do was tell me and i would rather have known and breakup vs be promised a tomorrow that she knew did not exist
her mom tells me she is been dodging her call and she suspects it is because it has to to with me but does not know for sure
i have no idea what to say with how she is telling me she would better off gone i am trying to support her mentally by checking on her often and reminding her i am right there for her
i love history and writing i want a soulmate who can communicate with me i was not the most perfect child when i was younger
i am accused of ease dropping in my own house when i am in my bedroom laying on the bed now i am really uncomfortable around her
my parents have always had arguments since i was a kid they used to fucking shout all night at eachother in the kitchen while i was in my bed trying to sleep i was like 6 at the time
my problem is the thoughts i have they are driving me crazy i can not stop thinking that he does not love me anymore and i can not stop thinking that when he finally gets tired of me and throws me out ill be all alone
i currently go to a psychologist but we are addressing other stuffthey are everywhere bedroom kitchen that restaurant this car that beach
only thing that kept me sane was online friend i met when traveling i felt like i could talk about anything with that person and i was very safe
everyone i know is doing so much better than me and i can not even take care of myself i can not move in with family because i have already been too much of a burden to them
after a little we sat down and talked about if we wanted to really be together and she was ecstatic and was optimistic about the vision of us being together
i have thought about it for a while and i have decided this is what needs to be done before life gets worse
and family can not help without going into full detail about my condition is enough to breakdown mother and its taking everything she has to endure her own struggles and live for me so ill be the biggest asshole in the world to burden her with my own
when i went to college my loneliness became a lot more relevant and harder to deal with as i was surrounded by people with their groups of friends making me feel more lonely
i am sure he just wants me gone and does not want me around at work so i am looking for a job elsewhere but i feel i have to get far away
his reasoning was that if he spends more time with me then his problems will go away making it seem like my mom is trying to keep me away from him which is not the case at all i litterally make plans and have a car i can go over at any time and have before to pick him up
but i was arrested a few times and after a month everyone knew my name i just feel so confused it came out of nowhere to me
the only diagnosis i have ever received was general anxiety and general depression how could these trained professionals not recognize that i was suffering much more than that i challenged them i told them that there must be a more underlying issuebut they always turned a blind eye
they are surrounded by people and are always wanted they always get this type of attention that i have never had
its been exactly 3 weeks since i came home and you said i am miserable i am ending it and you left moving out fully the next day
i was in the same boat as you for years i idealized having a partner yeah i was lonely and had tons of problems but i assumed when got into a relationship somehow everything would be better
i am not looking for any horny comments i am looking for advice on how to stop thinking about sex with my ex
and i guess i am in that part of my journey now the doctors and police officer could not believe how someone was so happy cuffed in a bed for so long
she grew so much that she became patient with me whenever i throw tantrums about how hard it is that we do not get to talk to each other like we used to
i just miss cafe so much i used to hang out with my friends in a coffe shop every day but now every thing shut down at 16h and i do not have any friends left still friends but lost contact
and here i am grieving and having a hard time moving oni am worthy of warmth and unconditional love i do deserve these things
i know i can control her friends or anything but i thought this would be understandable to her at least look at my perspective
anw we ended without any major argument there was no begging from my side i only proposed a solution which got rejected and thanks to lovechat i directly ran to no contact
it is the only way i can make sure everyone gets something so i still have hisi do not really know how to interact anymore so i just keep my mouth shut and head down
getting married was just about the most important life goal i had for myself now it will never happenhope you liked this little excerpt full longform posts can be found right herehttpsmaxjancarcom on my blog
during this all i did my best to help her and be there for her i read article after article to really understand how she felt and how i could help her i grabbed her a glass of water everytime she threw up i cleaned the house picked her daughter up from school stayed up with her if she could not sleep
i think i am useless and everything will be better without me i am very lazy maybe she is not avoidant at all and she was just young immature
depending on the day she is either cold with me or starts talkative but then eventually just turns cordial despite my efforts to make it fun
i have some sort of undiagnosed lung issue and covid will certainly give me an excruciating and slow death due to my states california lack of any icu space
like i literally have visions of him and i together and like dreams or something of him telling me how sorry he is and how much he loves me
i am at my wittts fucking end and honestly if i can not have sex naturally at 23 on top of all the other shit that already makes my life suck i think i will kill myself because fuck this it is straight up not worth it
and i feel so guilty because i know some people in the world have it harder than me but i just feel so lonely and seeing everyone so happy with their family on christmas eve just makes me want to cry and i have no friends to talk to because they are all busy or i have cut ties with them and i just can not do this anymore and i just want one reason to stay that is not that i am going to miss anything because i know i will not and that people will not miss me either
her parents abused her both emotionally and physically her dad was manipulative and she was never sure if his love came with ulterior motives
i have always been a very selfless person and put others needs before my own whenever i can but i feel that people are just abusing that and using me should i stop always being selfless or is that an asshole thing to do
i keep trying to find reasons why it would hurt the people i love but all of this just reinforces the love i have for others is not reciprocated and everyone in my life has already adjusted to their life without me in it
i have been trying so hard to not think of this but this seems to be the only solution i am finding
all my life i have felt like i just do not connect with the world or society i rarely genuinely connect with people
there are times where she confessed that i had the potential to change the course of her life if i ever left and i said the same
it is not that i am lazy or do not know what to do but i simply clock out because i guess everything seems pointless
1010 human full of smile and good vibesdoes not say shit like stop being depressedlistens and tells me it is okay to cry and what not
i hate to say it but i feel like some people are just meant to be alone lonely sometimes people are just no good
i really want someone else to have my place some other person would definitely make my parents proud and live my life better unlike me
but i think eventually i will kill myself over this not right now but in 10 years i will still feel fucking bad about what i have done and end it i lost my dignity selfworth and honor because of this she will have forgotten about me by then so i hope she will not connect the dots all because of one stupid and foolish impulse to write suicidal texts to her i completely ruined myself
however i know that at least one person in my life would never take the time to understand mental illness and suicide
no replies and did not even read the messages until i asked what is wrong so i called i texted no one picked up no one responded
she even wondered if i was interested in getting back with her but that just seemed impossible now i did not even seriously consider it
i am disabled on ssi and i have a real logical negative image of things it is made this break up difficult in that every time i have accomplished something it has fallen through or been taken
from my point of view most of these traits are true thanks whoever you believe they found me and took me to the hospital
i share a room with my sister and i just want hee to stop trying to talk to me even though i am clearly ignoring her she is just trying to casually talk does not know i have got problems
i have nothing to be upset about i am so privileged and have such a loving family but at the same time i feel so alone but i also force myself to be alone
anyway i was wondering if there is a chance that this experience has traumatized me in some way at first i thought ptsd might have something to do with it but it seems to me that ptsd is only defined as being relevant to individuals who have lived through specific traumatizing experiences that haunt them in their lives ie flashbacks etc
so i forgave her and moved on from it then there was this other time that is a huge red flag
i have told christian god and because christian god maybe is not real maybe other gods heard me that i do not want to make these promises ι told him or them if they heard me that i would only mean a promise if i validate it by doing the cross sign 3 times
i have been having pretty bad depersonalizationderealization for a few months now after a bad drug experience and stress in general but i have been seeking out help therapy meds i am on prozac for about a month now and also occasional bromazepam doses
so this all started when a couple of years ago i got very desperate and lonely and decided to start talking to people online
i have not done anything i wanted to do since 2004 i mean anythingno video games made every excuse on the book to not let me in the final one he could get on was
i enjoy being alone but sometimes when i see a group of students or a pair that are going somewhere together eating together or studying together i kind of feel lonely
part of me katy perry also there is a good punk goes pop version of this if you like more alternative styles
i am a giver and always tries to make him happy i am also very addicted to the safety he provides i am very scared to be alone with my thoughts and i am scared that it also might be the reason i am staying
there were times when she could not take it anymore which is normal but she is also the first ever person i met who really understood me more than anybody else
it feels unreal i think we both had our faults but i know i could not walk out that door but you could
i entered at art school after a lot of struggle at 20 and now i am 25 it is 4 years the school unemployed
everytime i thought of that memory i get scared and could not think straight go back to the present i had the chance to be in another relationship
this happened when i was around 15 during one of my worst depressive states in middle school i am sorry for being so annoying
on top of that covid has not helped much either we do not have a clear picture of when we would see each other next
i just wanted to get my thoughts out how things are going now in my life maybe someone have experienced it too and give my a proper advise
sure i may be just a kid and it may sound overdramatic to many but i just do not see myself going out any other way unless i die from some sort of terrible accident
i saw a post on reddit years ago where a grandson was talking about his grandpa about life and the grandpa described life as taking a shower paraphrased
making things worse she also has a wonderful dog that i grew incredibly attached to over the past two years that i am now forced to be apart from making it feel like i am grieving two losses instead of just one
to be clear i am over that person and the relationship but i just had to vent a little about the betrayal
does anyone ever feel like you speak some other language like when you try to talk to others they do not really seem to understand you and i am not even talking in the most deeply way but sometimes in the most basic way
what would you like to include in the world different forms of loneliness what environments trigger the feeling of loneliness the most
so she broke up with me 3 months ago it came out of nowhere and around the same time i did discover she was flirting with some work colleague
i did not find religion or anything to even followtherapy never helped me eitherbut knowing that i almost died and would have never even got to the point of feeling happyand that is more depressing than anything i ever went throughand that is saying a fucking lot
and they never used to message me first and then college began in college i had one close friend but then he backstabbed me and i had other good friends but same scenario with them i would always initiate chatting with them but they would never start messaging me first and when i used to call them for hanging out they would never come and they would never call me when they used to hang out with each other
you can not think of anything tangible or practical even a magical lamp only grants three wishes she never really posted stuff like this when we were together
the first 6 months went super smooth it was like we both found our soulmates we even moved in together so had our honeymoon phase
i try so hard to be happy and it never last i tried so hard to finish school and i failed
they say she destroys me and i know they are right but i lie in her cold arms when everybody else is gone
i have been doing this for so long its so tiring constantly helping people feel better but never having someone to help me
i do not think i can bring myself to actually shoot myself in the head but i just ordered a shit ton of dxm and i can definitely use that to overdose i do not really know why i am posting this here because i am not trying to get someone to change my mind and i doubt you guy are going to give me suggestions on which one is the better way to go
i am always busy in one way or another with my schedule but i have been get this cloud of sadness spontaneously come throughout the day whenever i think about her
i was watching youtube on my laptop just gaming videos nothing scary when i imagined another humanoid like figure that had spider like legs crawling quickly through the hallway and climbing up my footboard onto my bed
i do this in medical settings as well i reached out to a program through my doctors office and was asked point blank what i needed i basically bulletpointed my behaviors and concerns in a very articulate and matter of fact manner
and of course i think most people can relate to that but for me i think it me really hard because of how i think i am at least partly responsible for the sick and twisted thoughtprocess that most people have about pornstars more particularly female pornstars
i feel like i have to punish myself for what i have done like i am not supposed to be alive we did not eat that night
good observation my dear reader but contrary to popular belief grief actually does not work that way you want to be around people with the right energy
mindhttpswwwmindorguk a great aggregator and portal of mental health resources one of the most helpful features is it let us you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources
sort of knew this was coming though been pretending to be alright for the past few days i just hope after this i will be okay for a while
with that out of the way i will not insult your intelligence by restating my question it is in the title to start i have trouble sleeping every night i toss and turn and simply can not fall asleep and when i finally do i wake up in brief interims of time for instance i will fall asleep and wake up 2 hours later and then another hour after that
your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life keep going tough situations build strong people in the end
i swallowed it all for years i could not throw everything away just for sex but ultimately this was the reason she dumped me she started believing maybe i was the reason for her attitude and that she had to try stuff with another guy to see if anything changed so long for all the times i got blue balls and said nothing
for once i not as stressed out as always i able to socialize properly instead of usually she put me on a different medication for adhdadd
do not know how to feel currently was with my wife for 10 years come to find out she was having a affair with her ex for the last year of our marriage then i start dating this girl took a job to be closer to her even moved from another state for her after being gone for 7 weeks
i have never been this depressed before things have been hard to do but i have never got the it is impossible to get out of bed
i can not come up with a reason why i would be other than the way i perceive the world and how my interestsconcerns are widely different from the typical 18year old guy
his texts to my mom and now me and my sister have often gotten really bizzare where he would tell my mom that their texting is only about the money for the kids and my mom is fine with it but then he sends really weird memes

i just feel like running away somewhere and with this pandemic all i can now think of is to end myself
which further leads for the other cousins naturally think he is socially inept and she told me she hears voices a lot too
i lost a pregnancy that was going to show that the abuse i would been told to believe is fake was true
not that i was in any sense over him before but i am regressing a little bit and i can not stop thinking about how much i miss him and wish that he would come back
i am so sick of being psychologically abused gaslit falsely accused of shit and not even being able to do the same thing to others and apparently my ways of thinking are logically reasonable but superficially appear to be manipulative which must make it the case
my ex and i still live together with our two roommates we get along okay but there is still a lot awkwardness and distance between us i just feel so lonely being socially isolated from all these people i so recently was able to connect with emotionally covid has made it worse and i just feel lonely i would love some words of encouragement or advice right now
anyways we got home and i looked up and saw a shooting star and the most pathetic thing i wished for was him
i was trying to do some math exercises for a test that was around the corner there were a lot of different subjects that i had to learn them in a really short time
the friend finally responded after months but refuses to talk to me about what happened i think i caused it and he will not tell me or he lies about it
i am just really afraid that something will go wrong and that something will happen and i than will have the actuall reason not to be happy
going to cinema then try to make that person ask out hisher friends with both of youthe last couple of days have been relaxing and overwhelming at the same time for me emotionally
none at all the persons answer basically told me to shut up and just woman up and stop complaining i am not i do not want attention
and then they wonder why i do not trust them when i have mental breakdowns and i have been on the verge of killing myself so many fucking times because i know they are just going to act like i am a fucking lunatic invalidate my feelings when literally all i ever wanted was a hug and then say that i have to pray to god
i am a uni student living alone and have no friends here when i arrived her officefriend was on the couch just chatting to her at 1145pm
i have a question i will be visiting a psychiatrist next week i think the psychiatrist will most likely ask me about my traumatic experiences and i also think she will also ask about my life at home at school etc
really safe plus walking currently increases my pain a ton from the surgery i tried cleaning this place a few times already and moved stuff around
i catfished somewhat by posting pictures of college days that aside i met someone 31m whom i had the most fluid conversation with
someone whose codependent meaning someone who lacks boundaries and seeks fulfillment validation and confirmation that they are loved not from within but from external sources such as their partner
i have had this problem for a couple of years although there were times where i was in a good place mentally but it seems to always be a recurring thing that never goes away permanently
well it turns out i got my wish after finally finding a person i felt a deep connection and infinity with i easily fell into and experienced my first love for the first time in my life i put in the effort and joined the chase with all my being but to no avail it seems even this was not enough as i once again was not able to establish a relationship deeper than casual sex
i thought if i could remove the one variable of weight our relationship could snap into what a relationship should be
hey folks fellow lonely person here i was wondering if anyone could suggest discord servers where we can just chatcall and relieve some loneliness if not would anyone want to create something like that
when i was younger it was a little easier i guess because everything was somewhat new and exciting but now i just do not see a way out of this black hole
ever since she died its like i still see her and hear her barking or feel her in my faceshe would smell my nose and luck my face to wake me up
recently i realised that i am not even seeing a friend once a week and i think it is shockingly sadwow is not that fucking amazing wow
with my meals she was furious that i did not talk to her about what was wrong instead i can not blame her
what do i do next for myself and themi am an abusive brother who blames his undiagnosed autism and is clueless about others feelings
i am a bit shy but i like to talk to people i have many interests and hobbies i know i should not have done that it came out in a panic and i know it hurt her
the friends i am talking about are the people who would be in the visitors room if you got into a car accident
it does not help that pretty much every time that attention is not on him he has to put himself in the center making it impossible for me to vent about something or to even have a hobby or interest to myself and everyday i am not and will never be quine
when the slightest of things goes wrong and i am left with my own mind no immediate huge distractions my internal voice will just start planting every possible worse outcome in my head it is not just like hearing voices because the voice is mine
as if that was not enough one of the kittens i hand raised and tamed had to be put to sleep due to cancer after i spent 350 dollars i did not fucking have to try and save her life it was not my cat though it was my dads so another kick in the nuts
i am not even really sure why i am on this subreddit or if it is the right place for this kind of thing
out of a relationship since july we broke nc multiple times and now we are just texting once in a while nothing serious
also the guy replied to my desperate at that point threatening texts literally like an arrogant kid to say the minimum he was arrogantly proud but i do not care
he is camping in the living room and i am trying to avoid him at all costs you decided to let me go and i am afraid that i will never recover from this
i came back home from a corporate trip and after a round of howdys the first thing i said was that we should move out
recently met a young woman who needed an ear so lent mine to clarify i have no intention or urge to betray my wife
but i think it was for the best it hurts so fucking much but its for the bestit is christmas eve and my family is screaming my moms drunk
i had a lot of issues with a parent and relationships with others kids teachers growing up so i do not know if that is why
sometimes there is even victimhood so no i am not out of that web yeti have been with my fiancé for four and a half years
so i just saw pictures of my exs new baby with their partner on instagram and it is bizarre given how i am so far away from that stage of life right now
but anyway ik this may seem like a generic post because almost everyone here goes through what i am going through at some point but i just wanted a place to vent myself and so i decided to come here
wtf how do you dump someone and then see if they are okay after 3 months because you have a stupid dream about them
part of my wants to try again tonight to keep trying until i actually do it i do not want to hurt people i care about but it feels so hard to think straight or at all these days i just want things to stop
please if anyone is struggling please message me on here on instagram saaam_jones that hurt me because i know he knows that is not true
i have dealt with major depression and suicide attempts in my past but i am better now until recently a close friend of mine who is 15 i am 16 committed suicide
this is a safe space and a lovely community for you to talk about your mental health experiences and relationship experiences without feeling threatened or judged
i think i have social anxiety and i do not want to let my parents know about it i was thinking if going to the school counselor but i have heard that they do not give diagnosis
i find myself worrying that by watching that movie because i want like a normal person i may still be breaking the promise to gods
so why is he still on that pedestal why do i still worship him how do i get him off that pedestal
you are going to go on social media and even if people tell you to unfollow them and block them you will unblock them and find another password to get through to them
she does not seem like that person though she does want to remain friends but it hurts too look at her right now
however most depression tests i do come up as not depressed just unhappy which is how i feel a bit flat lacking motivation
i realize she is nitpicking me and finding reasons to sabotage our relationship20m i mean the past 2 years have just been awful straight downhill after graduation
fuckkk idk why i am posting this if anyone is from devon uk and would like to give me some local help that would be amazing
i have contemplated suicide and came very close twice sometimes i even dream about it i know what you are thinking my ed is probably a result of my depression
i put all this pressure on myself to have happy holidays that when we got into this fight it all started going uncontrollably downhill
at the start of december my stepmom tells me she is taking her granddaughter in the next city over to a pageant with the panic going on it sounded like the most insane thing to do i told her it was a completely unnecessary risk but she did it anyway lo and behold she ended up catching it
i remember he asked me where that voice comes from where i would think to myself they all hate me and it is like that 4 year old me who was burned hiding under some covers
but why leave the papers not very well hidden if you did not want anyone to find out he finally started to get counseling thru the va by telephone until covid started then counseling stopped
i love folk and jazz i put out a folk album at the end of last year and i am working on a follow up with more jazz influence to it
tears streamed down my face and i was choking on my breath trying to not make too much noise and yet i can not survive any other way i do not know
i loved you so much i was determined to stand beside you no matter what our peers and parents threw our way
my ex and i lived together for two years during covid we because incredibly toxic where we would constantly argue name call be physically aggressive toward one another him not care that i would cry myself to sleep never discuss our issues him withhold affection when he was not in a good mood and toward the end i just genuinely annoyed him we talked about breaking up almost constantly marchaugust and i moved out in september
some should say that i got to have fun at the age but it seems blah i feel so drained nothing feels enjoyable
i am seeking validation from this support group because i am not getting it from my friends here at home i personally am hurting because everyone here thinks that being the dumper makes you the bad guy
they will start arguing with me if they see i am not studying idk why i am posting it hereit is been about a month since my breakup
i feel like i am still living in denial and cannot accept how after 2 years of staying together he can just decide to leave
i rlly want to end thing soon but i just can noti am almost about to graduate high school and i am so numb to thoughts of relationships
like everyone here has voids and causes they are lonely from something about something but not me apparently and that makes me fucking ashamed like i am supposed to be happy nothing is greatly wrong with my life but i feel so fucking lonely like i am breathing with a giant hole in my lungs
and i know that if i will ever be with someone it is going to be someone damn special because my life is already filled with love and happiness
i have a mental illness and i have been on medications for 5 years now but i feel like i am getting worse
for context i will once again mention that i do not plan on leaving my religion he really wants a person he can confide in and feel comfortable with being vulnerable
that kind of feels like the most certain kind of a no absolutely not not even a consideration i feel like i would just fucking implode inside or go straight to killing myself
for example if i am in mcdonalds with some of my friends they get treated with welcoming hands while i only get workers yelling at me to off i have not even spoken to them and i am the same color as them
this was just me putting my hands on a keyboard and saying my meaning i am 174cm and weight between 5961kg
one of my close friends has started experiencing these attacks more frequently it used to be every once in a while and now it can occur multiple times a day i was wondering if anyone had any advice for things i could do to help them or ease them at all like in person over text or on the phone i really want to help but i am not sure how
just like in real life i told you everything was okay no matter what happened and would never want anyone but him
did you know when you are imagining something like playing hockey and when you are actually doing something like actually playing hockey your mind goes through the exact same processes so neurologically doing something and imagining something are the same thing
anyway i have not seen the two of them since october last year when we hung out and got coffee before they had to leave so i was really excited to see them again now that lockdown rules are loosening up here in the uk
there is no escaping the pandemic signs of its existence are everywhere you look i really needed to get my feelings out because i have been feeling increasingly worse any advice is really appreciated
i would give anything to be able to move in with my partner tomorrow because life right now feels empty and meaningless
it was a two way street but i was the only one affected this summer i stole old pain meds from my sister and took a lot of them
i let you back into my life the first time you decided to leave it as a friend because i know i did wrong but i can not let you back in next time you try to come back because you caused me too much pain
i just got a new great tattoo for free and another one planned something from the kite runner my family is finally moving from my childhood home
it is super dumb but has anyone ever tried to kill themselves by ingesting everything they can find i am talking toxic stuffs like perfume high dose of caffeine and vitamins and all the pills pesticidal and other stuffs
warning some examples ahead sometimes when i am walking with a pencil i will think of stabbing my pet in the the eye with or if i i am chopping vegetables i will think of stabbing it trough my hand
i can not argue with that so i just have to accept that i am a lazy piece of shit who is incapable of changing
kids at my high school were mean and bullied me literally because of my family situation this made me develop severe anxiety and i did not have many friends mainly just a few acquaintances
it did not work with the new guy and i feel so stupid i do honestly think i still loved him though i would not have forever
i tried to explain that boundaries need to be set when you are dating someone to make them comfortableprotect the relationship
i do not agree at not mourning the relationship and the good times you hadits natural crying is natural and let me tell you crying will help you clear your headso if you want to cry cry your heart out but always remember things will change may be you ll cry for one day one month or one year or more like 2 years for mebut trust me it ll chnage
what prompted me to write this post is i watched a ted talk about what determines a long life and it said relationships
i am fine with solitude and being alone but its the loneliness that is killing meh like whenever i want to confide in someone i feel like my circle is very limited
i am a person that holds onto things like memories for instance i just can not let go easily i used to have so many pictures of myself from around 7 or 8 years ago up to around last year and friends etc saved on my phone laptop and even on my usb sticks because i never wanted to lose them
like i have a good job despite the pandemic i own a home with the love of my life just little things
i am pretty sure he does not know that i now know all this but his gf is feeling scared and she does not know what to do either i told her that i do not care what time it is if he needs someone to talk to i will gladly pick up the phone or if she needs to call me she can
the other half of me thinks while this break is hell for me its a relief for her i thought he was different
i came to realise even more how my avoidance made it impossible to have the wonderful relationship we could have had together
anyway sometimes i think about hurting myself i do not but i am worried i will i blame it on having such a good life that i just want a bad day to be normal
this is different than it was 1 year ago where i could close my eyes and think hard enough and those memories felt recent where i could even feel the emotions i felt when those memories were made like the joy felt at an amusement park or playing some silly board game or something
as much pain as she caused me and confused emotions i still wanted to fight for the relationship and have her in my life
i started to realize maybe we were on different pages and two weeks ago we got into a fight about seeing eachother timgin etc i exploded told her i was having doubts about us but in the end decided to keep going
a large set of app features that dealt with payments and multiple currencies that had to be in an old framework that had a ton of stuff that was quite beyond my level
i want to grow closer to him to see if we have both worked on ourselves enough to be happier together
he blames that on me for not having him over but truthfully he would always ask me to go over his house whenever i invited him over so
since then things have devolved everyone has become super polarized hyper partisan and a lot of people have fallen into fringe conspiracy theory
i just feel so fucking sad i am with my family but i feel so distant and like i could burst into tears at any moment
he gave me the feeling that he wanted to be with me again but the people around me told me not to trust it because he and lisa did a lot of relationship stuf
i am pretty tired of crying myself to sleep at night been waiting for things to change for like 5 years and it still has not gotten any better some people are just meant to be lonely for most of their lives
i am so tired of myself is he right for me or not can we make this work or not has he changed have i
i texted her wanting to say one more thing about how this realationship was the best i have had and she felt same even saying that if she can deal with some stress we could get back together
i have slept with a few people since the break up and felt fine i have not missed her and have been feeling pretty great about myself that was until this week
i just started playing animal crossing new horizons and realized the most anyone would talk to me are the residents that is when they have an above their head signifying they have something to tell me
i have bad anxiety and i take everything personal and i am over jealous of peoples lifes even though i getting mostly anything i want and live a good life with good parents who have good jobs and are very good with money
honestly i just wanted a high paying salary so i stuck with law my undergraduate gpa is not very competitive either so overall maybe i should have switched my career goals earlier this year
i am sorry for posting this but i had to say it somewhere otherwise i would just try to continue to ignore how i am feeling
i am a 34yearold gay male i have struggled with my weight and body image since childhood and i have battled binge eating disorder for nearly as long
was somehow starting to make me feel hope again things are not getting better all i feel is sorrow and misery
it is not helpful i feel as though i can not truly tell my therapist how i feel without being hospitalized without my therapist fearing that i will hurt myself or act on my thoughts
trusted someone for the first time in years exposed my insides to them and they ran away with the excuse that they needed some time to themselves
at this point however i felt anger against her that i never felt for her throughout the entirety of our relationship
i am in college and most of my friends have gone home for the holidays i am staying in town to work but i am finding it really hard to be alone especially with covid restrictions
my therapist told me it is a part of my anxiety manifesting itself and why i exhibit physiological responses even in my sleep
i got nothing to look forward to i noticed i am starting to think dangerously so i thought i should tell my friends but i was met with either sarcasm or useless stuff like do not think like that
i convinced myself that this is not about me that he might need help and decided that i needed to get him out of his hole
i spend my days sleeping browsing the internet and cryingi do not feel like i have any purpose to my life i just want it to end
reading through all of the terms on this page i found nine with which i can at least partially identify including arospike caligoromantic greyromantic and sometimes inactoromantic sometimes but certainly not all the time
i am currently in a pretty nice relationship but it always seems to get complicated my abuser is still in my life
it is currently 4am and i just woke up from incredibly loud screaming crying and arguing of my dad and either my mom or sibling now within 5 seconds it faded away like some kind of audio and i have been intensely listening in case i still hear it but to no avail except for that i know my dad and uncle are still awake
suicidal ideation is becoming a daily occurrence to the point i know how i would want to do it although i feel i do not want to die i want to live and be loved more than anything
going through my first breakup longterm bf and i do not absolutely know what to do with myself it ended a week ago now i am alone and lonely sad and there is covid and there is the holidays and i am miserable i have no family nearby so all the support i get is through phone calls i have a pet so at least i get some hugs from him life is hard right now
is there a way to prepare for something like this although i roamed him alone because i did not want to see anyone and now i feel so bad
english is not my first language and i wrote this in the span of two days so sorry if its inconsistent or vague at times
for example i could say ew that is really grossevery time i try to be myself i get called a fucking tranny
i met her online a few weeks ago but i have known her even before then through my family who have nonstop pestered me with needing to talk to her
at the start i was afraid i was going to just stop breathing and suffocate to death and after eating some kinds of food my throat would feel tense to the point i could not eat more or it would get kind of tense on its own among other similar things
has this been you at all i have been going at a rate of talking to hardly anyone except the usual impersonal exchanges with store clerks and such most of the dialogue is all in my head as people will not talk to me i am middle aged single crap family and town so it is been a rough one i hardly want this shit anymore such a dark world now
since then i lost a lot of my support systems due to death lack of communication or the like my depression is definitely starting to affect my life again
after i put them to bed or when their mom comes to get them i always regret how i treated them while they were with me
you lost your love and now you miss your dreaminyou feel so lonesome and your heart is heavy i worry about him still he does not believe covid19 is real i cry when i watch our shows still
hey reading all these posts and reminding a part of myself in them is something what makes me empathize to each of you
so every day i saw my boyfriend and wanted to kill him coz i just could not to hide from him coz me had the same life i also understand now that i just addicted to him and to this kind of relationships so after school i still stayed with him for half year
others i need to be high i need to be drunk or asleep i just want to be done i am so tired and everything hurts
although a person with corruption ie deep depression andor deep addiction the ego does exist and puts the id and superego in agreement despite them being both wrong typically this is where a person needs help the most where their thoughts and actions are aligned in this way for example doing drugs feel good id and are good for us superego therefore we should do them often ego
guess what nothing happened and i was simply ingnored for like 34 yrs until i made an actually friend at my senior year
i guess i just need someone to tell me i made the right decision that it gets better and that there are other cool people out there it was my first love it was familiar and amazing but terribly unhealthy i suppose lots of manipulation and pressure to do things according to her wishes i made lots of mistakes as well but does that invalidate what she did to me
that i did not talk to other girls for a year while it was more like 8 to 9 months it is all pointless energy
because only by knowing what the real problem is you will then be able to overcome iti am not sure how to even write about todays feelings i just do not feel right
i do not think my feelings will fade though and i do not think i will ever be able to be friends with her
i wonder what i should take from this and what it means your thoughtsi am feelin lonely nowadays but hes so good to me
eventually i became nihilistic as life lost its meaning and cemented itself in that way i slowly started accepting it and now i realize that as tiny as i am and as meaningless as life the universe and the time we have here is i feel free
they work on ambulances and she starts to pick up a whole bunch of ot shifts the vast majority of them are with this same guy
i am 22 my birthday is december 29th and i think that is the day i decide to end itsocks necklace keychains
backstory i had met her on a camping retreat with my best friend hit it off the moment we met and dated for nearly 3 years her family liked me my family adored her and i was more than prepared to marry her proposed 7 months prebreak up
i do not have any friends any real genuine one that is always there for me i think even then the depression developed more and more then i met a guy let us call him tom
i keep walking to the edge of the highways to run through but i get scared and i feel guilt at the thought of harming other people
but i think of him constantly it is almost like he is here in a living daydream and in this dream he is confident and happy and is willing to be present with me and love me forever
multiple types of therapy multiple clinicians i have tried meds done a lot of inner work spiritual work as well that is what a healthy me would do but instead i missed him so much it ached
in the end there was really no way for us to talk ourselves out of the breakup or to try and save it
i asked him if he was okay if he ate and such he was so dry and mean so so complicated why did i fall so hard for her
i have not seen or heard from him since so i told him i have no idea turns out he tried oding and had went to the hospital
some background i have been lonely for a good chunk of my life i always had trouble making friends and by high school i only really had one real life friend and a couple online friends i always wanted to change this but due to social anxiety and just poor people skills i just do not know how
after a couple of weeks of this i asked if she was seeing anyone as most breaks are because one person wants to see someone new
i want us again but i do not think now is our time i hope you will one day feel like we can exist together too
during covid a friend i was close to online but had not been close to in years as they had made other friends yet we still talked just disappeared
before i go does anyone know the cure for having become pure hate from trauma endured last night was the first time i actually broke down in tears since the breakup has happened
she suddenly was really emotionally distant after our conversation and it sort of killed the spark i know it is beating a dead horse and everyone is been through this
this has happened a lot to me over a lot of situations and with different people every time i mess up in some way or even feel like i did it completely destroys me
edit i am just so tired please just tell me it is okay to goi am new to reddit so after that i did not really ask him to get back with me i mean obviously i can not
i can not seem to be able to move on i feel stuck some days i feel absolutely fine then the next i want to cry my eyes out
depression and anything else comes from how i grew up i feel abandonedi am also suppose to ignore my education knowledge skills and anything i know about disability human resources finance

i went to tell my mom to not get angry and if she could just go with my dad i am not interested in anything not even things i used to have an undying passion for
now i am left here looking after our child working a fulltime job and speaking with my wife on a daily basis about the issues in her life
but what should i do now should i tell him this or should i go nc again and wait if he reaches out i am confused haha
the only thing i remember is that once i had a serious about what called head concussionuntil now i am not sure does it the reason or i am just a stupid person
i just started seeing her as not reliable nor trustworthy and this led to me breaking up with her as i felt she would have a bad impact on me and my goals selfish i know but i do worry about myself and preserving my mental health
i have lost all my motivation it was christmas and all i did was lay in bed for the half of it then get dragged down to open presents with my family

i am afraid of leaving the people i love behind which are very few people now it consists of my little sister our cat peanut and my boyfriend of almost 2 years now
the same people who pointed out to me that i objectify men and am predatory sexually towards men are now telling me not to give up that it is silly to be alone for the rest of your life you will be unhappy so on and so on
he did not believe me when i told him one was a ponzi scheme until the ftc shut it down after he put 37k into it in 4 months
the friends i do have both irl and online i feel like they do not want to have a conversation with me so i do not force it i have the sense that they do not really like me all that much or hearing from me so i deactivate my socials and continue to ignore my texts if i am not feeling like this it is because i am too anxious to respond although i would like to
since i am trans and a democrat it looks like i am in the crosshair because we have a hard time talking about anything other than the weather
i feel like i have never really had a high self esteem to begin with and it has only worsened through years and years of my life
i want to give him kisses and hugs and tell him it will be okay but i just can not everything hurts so much
but what i want i already fucked up 4 times or more over past 3 years i can not get it to change or make anything different iam not happy unless i am with my family
yes i have not been able to travel or go out and meet other people but because of the current rate of how things operate in the world of today i felt that it was too much to keep up with and it was exhausting
let us say she broke up on a wednesday with a text she had told me her reasons why and i understood
i can not talk to any of my friends anymore i can not watch youtube they are even tracking my spotify so i can not listen to songs they do not like
she then lists specific people and things they have done for her the you who would make me feel loved like no one else was around the good was too good
it makes me feel like such a bad person anyone who reads this i would greatly appreciate your input this results in me knowing nobody here
i remember once i was accidentally alone on christmas stuck out in middle of nowhere alone in a strange town because of poor planning add issues
why would a person in some cases hide during a relationship a backup guy my ex told me that this guy only writes likes in her insta picturesno conversation or whatever
she was trying to change other parts of her lifestyle also getting involved with her faith again working out the whole thing
i did not want to have another part of me being taken away from me again i do not know what made her unhappy because i tried to make her happy
i have been trying to get better both on my own and with several therapists and medications but nothing works i seriously do not think i can convince myself that it is worth waiting until tomorrow for much longer
my biggest mistake was i thought she could help me but i was totally wrong not her fault she is a great woman but for the best of us soon my ex
i need help i see a therapist but i do not know how to talk about it i barely remember what i do day to day a constant autopilot
i want to spend more time with them but i worry that they do not actually want me there and they just feel bad
i told her that i felt uncomfortable because it felt weird she told me i was crazy paranoid and i should apologise and so i went over and did
i have spent many months in psychiatric hospitals for suicide attempts in the past been given all the resources available yet nothing is remotely helpful
i have been on anxietydepression meds for almost three years now and they did help but this constant thought of wanting to die has never left me
he came over and i knew it was coming we had gotten into a bit of an arguement the night of halloween
i really do not date a lot and i find it hard to open myself up to someone and finally when i did it backfired
he says he needs time to think about it and still ultimately want to make it work with us what do you guys think why does he need time to make this decision
i am not going to take any alcohol or drugs buy guns or drive over the speed limit if i got my hands on a car
i have never felt this sort of connection and attraction to anyone it is so strong and intense it scared me at first
i have always been a very affectionate and loving guy maybe a bit too much when i give myself i give 100
i also want to make posts regard personal help or articles regarding depression or means to help remedy specific problems in out lives
on memorial day she spends the whole day with him and even posts on one of her social pages that she had an amazing day
my mom just called me i answered and turns out it was accidental she did not know but i went to talk and happened to hear my boyfriends name and then my mom and sisters voices
do you think it is okay or will it be helpful to tell the psychiatrist about problems in the family like family members drug abuse domestic violence family being dysfunctional and so on those stuff are related to what is happening to me so
2 people from reddit told me that i am depressed but honestly i still do not think it is true i need someone who i can trust and confide in
all of my classmates were smart enough at 18 entered a 2 year school of tourist class i do not know how to describe it in english i hope you understand
goto activities when i feel down include cleaning my room reading a minimum of 1 chapter in a book doing chores calling a family member practicing guitar for an hour or going for a good walk with my dog
i literally can not deal with this pain anymore getting constantly put through so much emotional and physical damage has worn me down too much
i know it is mostly because of the pandemic but even my side gigs are dried up volatile family situation and living through a natural disaster meant it was hard for me to find any stability
knew i would not get much for a white gold ring they gave me 200 almost 10 for every year in misery i gladly took it i do not need the money and i do not want the ring going to take 150 of it and put it towards my vacation fund and the other 50 i am going to buy a nice juicy steak
then they did it again today to really drill in the point when most of us were there the day prior and got the same lecture
it is just impossible for me to take to heart anything anyone tells me when that person is in a relationship can date at any time etc
that is hardly an exciting prospect is it when i last did a course i sometimes felt so lonely at home that i went into the library just to be around people
he runs a business and he told me he works even more than he used to so he does not have time to think about it or miss me
depression hurts physically my headaches are such a tight feeling its like my heads being squeezed i find myself checkin my phone and i just have nothing
she then accused me of lying when i said i have not spoken to them about her i want to keep things on good terms
the day he left me i looked up in google how long does it take to feel better after a breakup google said the average time is 3 months and 3 days
idk what i want to do for the rest of my life i am 19 i am in school i love my friends but i just do not know anymore
his birthday is approaching and i am thinking to not message him because i do not want to upset him i do not want him to feel anguish
i can not stop my brain long enough so my body just goes into rest mode while my thoughts spin out of control then i realize i am hungry but i do not care
every date with another man i feel farther and farther from love it is so hard to trust anyone now will anyone love me through and through can i even trust myself enough to be vulnerable again
i would be in a position to make it happen anyway since i would have the respect the reputation the money and i would be able to make more time for it down the line
so i have already posted about this on here but i can not stop obsessing over it that is the hardest pill to swallow i am so scared i will not find someone great who will choose me
how i want to talk about our days like we used toyou lost your love and now you miss your dreaminyou feel so lonesome and your heart is heavy
i am not lonely in the general sense and she claimed that she loved me we could not spend enough time together this year
i know that they would either tell him to go f myself or label him as weirdo or somebody or something equally offensive or ignore me which is the worst
but it took me a couple of minutes to process and realised that it was not actually sadness it was more residual feelings that had resurfaced with the finality of things i had tied the loose ends of the relationship and i am moving on in peace by saying my piece the finality of the moment purged my residual emotions and feeling i had towards the relationship
is semi a hoarder of weird stuff and tends to make messes we both agreed once the lease is up in march she either move out or we do
it hurts to see them so vulnerable and all i want to do is be supportive and a friend i understand that sometimes love is backing off but the last two years of my life really felt like i was building towards something with them
it hurts you will not know how much it breaks your soul unless it happened to yousomething is really wrong with me
i am now in my 20s studying computer science at a highlycompetitive university arguable the toprated uni in my nation i do not have any particular interests so i just chose the field because of the money
i guess it really is an addiction but for me it is more to do with the reliance of communication i do not want to miss a message from someone and if i did it would make me paranoid about it happening again making me more addicted to checking for messages
i have been trying my best to keep myself distracted with work games or other friends even weed anything i can do to distract myself and make the days go by
classic wrong place wrong time unfortunately i know when i see her again back at school this spring it will tear me apart
the only person who cared about me a lot was my care taker this might sound silly but she was like a mother to me
i am not going to force myself into your life if you do not want me but we had to end it because it was too malignant for both of us
i now it sounds very idiotic and simple but i just can not deal with it it bothers me so much to the point of making me feel bad
two girls i used to be a close friend with since i was 15 always found excuses not to meet me everytime i came back to town they never asked me to meet and never sent a message to ask me how i was me and these people used to hang out together with my ex boyfriend but i have known them way before being in a relationship with him
i spent 4 years with her lost many friends stopped playing sports to spend more time with her and used all my free time to be with her as she wanted me to do
148httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat108s is christmas a good time to talk about my binge eating with my family 235httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat155s is it not too deep a topic for christmas
i would watch my brother succeed in almost everything he did whilst i would struggle with the most basic of social requirements that would make others respect you
when it was christmas eve on the tv there was a commercial that showed poor children not getting anything for christmas
if you have depression you might be interested in new treatments and there has been a lot of talk about ketamine
all my internship opportunities turned up jack shit now i am back to where i was before cold and alone with no future no relationship no anything
he was apologizing me for his mistakes however i got very emotional and said toxic things to him such as my other friends can comfort me better although that is never the case my boyfriend was the most understanding person i noticed immediately that i messed up i should never compared my boyfriend and my friends
and i feel very bad about it i do not know how make it bearable like i used to when i was 20 back then i did not care i really did not i had found strength in being alone i was enough for myself
one must go to school from a young age decide on a career while still a kid go to college work and pay off the debt from school retire die
there is also the false perception of a bargain i think i will buy this cheap laptop and upgrade the screen and some internal components myself and that will be cheaper than simply buying a laptop with the screen and internals that i would actually want in the first place that is also been pretty destructive and expensive with my cheap destroyed machines forcing me to buy another cheap machine that will soon also be destroyed
this whole year was kind of crap my mother recently got a new house and we had to leave because of the roommate being a ass so i had to leave to live with my dad and my siblings were split up to go with respective grandmother and my sisters stayed with mom with a friend
i followed through with the hardest decision i have made and i broke up with you i had my reasons and you were so upset telling me you are going to do better but i knew the truth you can teach a dog new tricks but it is still the same dog and besides i could not ask you to change for me so i told you to change for the better do not change for me or anyone else in that fact do not repeat my mistakes be who you are not who others want you to be you taught me that remember
i am still finding things of yours in my apartment after 4 months out of the blue i do not know what to do
and then if i complain to the other parent about how the other wrongfully acted you pick at the tiniest mistake i make and run with it oh heshe is just having a bad day
4 months ago i broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years whom i have spent 4 of those 6 years living together then i discovered that she had sex with a high school friend less than a month after our breakup and nos they are dating
after four years without pair i decide to find my love again but i feel like a little child now so i really do not know where to start or maybe i just afraid to start new relationships with someone
the few things that just keep popping into my head are the fact that she might send nudes or be more intimate with another guy and mess up her feelings even more
i can not never find happiness in socialising with people i is impossible to make friends with anyone the will hurt my and make use of my and of course i will never find any sort of love because most of the girls freak out of my that is what most girls and boys did say to me
and the strange thing is i do not seem to have any feelings i mean i am not happy sad or even angry i guess my brain is dying lol
hey just wanted to get everyone is feedback about random thoughts that your brain plays when trying to rest and meditate i find my thoughts are scattered and memories or life events play in my head when trying to rest
i find myself to be distracted most of the time thinking about this and i am unsure what to do i hate it does this happen to anyone else how do you deal with
this has not worked i tried phoning her on christmas day and told her that maybe i had made a mistake we had a 1015 minute phone call and i came clean about everything we spoke about things like adults and even had a few jokes here and there she text me after wishing me the best and saying that maybe we were just two people who got on really well together but were not romantically compatible
meds work and then they do not and repeat i am really tired of it i want to try electroshock therapy but my psychiatrist is having us increase my med dosage to the max before starting the process to receive tms instead that is fine i will do it
i feel i am stupid worthless i will never get a job i lost so many years doing nothing well i have good and bad moments at life like all of you movies songs friends and etc
the number of coincidences that lead me to him seemed like a miracle to me at that time he told me he got into a relationship this april
i am so disconnected from my family i moved so many times in my life i am 18 but i feel ancient and so damn lonely like i blew all my opportunities no matter how many parties i invite myself to or how many times i start chatting with a new coworker or something nothing ever works out
she told me out of nowhere that she had to talk to me that her feelings had changed i did not get any signals so it was like a truck hit me
this morning he cussed at me told me to shut the fuck up numerous times stop talking to him because i was annoying the shit out of him and said i was acting entitled and that i was not entitled to shit
this week i came down with corona pretty badly luckily not a terrible case but still sicker than i thought i would be and i am having trouble with a few things
i have almost always been lonely in 19 years i have had maybe 10 friendsi feel like my world has crashed down around me
i had a really good day for the first time in many months and now am having extremely bad thoughts over this
okay i am sitting here alone on christmas again and i have a question for my fellow suicidal peeps okay i do not know how many of you are familiar with the old movie called it is a wonderful life
however i made a post on another subreddit about an hour ago and the paranoia just seems to be growing as it still has not seemed to be posted
what is bad with gaming is that i lose control over reality i live in a world by my computer and let time flew by i feel so guilty for it because the only person in my family who i cared about and actually cared about me died this year what did i do gaming instead of being with her
so i have a friend group consisting of my best friend and this other guy let us call him jamie and because we spend a lot of time together me and my best friend try to put some effort into strengthening our bond to jamie however jamie has a bit of a reputation of being
i deleted my social media even though he did not have i know it hurts i know but i promise there is a light at the end of the tunnel
however fast forward a month and a half when we should have still been in our honeymoon phase he quit his job in the middle of the pandemic
it is been six months and we have not spoken at all she is currently dating someone else as of a couple weeks ago
theirs so much to my story i can not all fit here but summed up i have struggled with being too big of a people pleaser to the point where i will choose helping someone else over myself in an instant and i often forget to look after myself because i am too busy trying to help everyone else and when i can not help them i feel totally worthless like a failure and it eats at me
but here is the kicker i asked him if there was someone else and he said yes i could narrow it down pretty quickly and he told me i was right this girl is nothing like me early 20s no real plan in life drinks and parties i know her in real life
only after my brain sees that i have absolutely everything listed down will it let me start the task i was not like this before the lockdown but now i need to carry my writing pad everywhere i go including on a trip
actually the thing called time is more like a big ball pivoting which is dinge donge from a wibbly wobbly nonlinear timey wimey stuff
i do not drink or smoke or drug myself i take care of my weight and my diet for the most part
alway already date or date another man very very soon before discarded me and alway come back after 24 months and if i ignore her she will cut her hand with a razor and send this photo to me call my family cry angry with me
but the good outweighed the bad we pushed each other to pursue what we lovedshe is completely ghosting me from messages while together we have fun and she seems interested
to start off i was not really a lonely kid growing up always made friends easy i mixed with everyone at school from the extroverts to the introverts i knew everyone and everyone knew me i never really thought i would get to this point in my life and man it sucks
or another radio channel with switched between music and news and it was the same with that it was making me anxious
my now ex and i just broke up after taking a break on our relationship for 3 weeks it is also my birthday in 4 days
the fallout was a matter of beliefs and differences that i did not realise we had till then so after a few months of arguing and fighting i left
but since i am a huge introvert and was still depressed i did not manage to make any friends i was always lonely
the therapists i have seen have all made it worse and medication always sends me into a tailspini forgot how i look like clothes and hair are fine but my face is gone
so the most strange thing of my life the babes i have alot of babes somewhy mostly come out themselfes the joke it hat the comes out mostly when i am going up
this has been my life for the last three months one blow after another with selfish ignorant people who continue to be absolute douchebags fighting over inconsequential shit that no sane person would give a damn about
i nearly killed myself by swallowing tons of pills then had an urge to live and threw up my guts i lived obviously i have cut myself so many times and my mom says i am just seeking attention my dad just ignores them i am not seeking attention i just want out
taking a shower feels impossible and when i finally manage it washing my hair is even harder then after that you have to get dressed brush you hair ect and i can not do it
i grew up to the thought that once we all die we will all be reunited in heaven which branches naturally from my fairly religious family but as i get older my perception of religion and spirituality gets a little too shaken up for me to ever be sure about anything
i then realised like usual i felt drained of energy it is been about 2 months since i have decide to let go of the relationship
2 i do not want to leave school because when i am at home i am ignored and alone my parents work from home but barely look at me during the day
on tuesday i was supposed to get a haircut from my momi am 14 btw one of my alters ryzi gets panic attacks when my hair cut
about a month ago she gave me a drunken love confession saying that she loves me and would do anything for me
she has to get away from her family her 7 year old relationship ended a year ago and her family and friends are not making it easy for her
thanks friends sending lots of love to all of you i looked in the mirror and hated myself i cried daily for a month
please i just need some advice or stories or anything no matter what i do i can not stop thinking about him and caring about him its been months and nothing has changed
i do not know what is wrong with me it is 5 am and i have not slept so sorry if this is rambly and does not make sense
as much as i like this as a safe space where we can discuss our common problem i also tend to think that we are somehow being trapped in here and i do not think we are actually improving each other just rehearsing negative emotions
september of 2017 i met someone online j we will call her by random chance was not looking for anything it just happened
i feel almost as if i am on speed i also tend to sing a lot and just make noise in general
i hit the gym enroled in salsa class and met a cool group from my town in the online game i mentioned before even though it hurts playing something that we played together and she is now playing with someone else she loves
i have had that feeling of not wanting to talk to my family or friends because i do not trust them enough or the need for someone else to be there and hug you when you need it the most
i feel like she is just messing with me to get a reaction out of me she does not seem like that person though
as the game continued the boys called me lame and stupid which i do not really care about but then they started to get closer to me and one of the boys pressed himself against me on a car after i had said no to doing any touchy things with them
who the hell wants to drink wine alone or rootbeer if you do not drinki love them both honestly with that being said i just wanted to extend a simple invitation for a friendly message
so anyways a few months ago i was followed and grabbed by a man while walking home and i succeeded in escaping however after that day my jaw keeps clenching and my tounge is pushing against my teeth it prevented me from falling asleep a few times
my girlfriend has been struggling recently and all i want to do is help i am always there and try and say the right things
this process makes it possible for the two of you to become one or in other words you become a part of your partners identity and vice versa
the lady was very pleasant and she talked to me which calmed me down for a while she advised to find comfort in family and friends
if i try to get more help and admit the ect has not worked i will probably end up in the mental health ward again and at this rate would likely lose my job
i appreciate that sometimes they do initiate the chat with me and starts a conversation but most of the time if i do not initiate a conversation i will literally have zero messages in my inbox and this just makes me feel like noone cares about me
i spent an hour researching how to tie a proper noose then i heard my son cry upstairs and snapped out of it not i feel even worse about myself then i did before
hi everyone i am not one for making posts but things have been really difficult recently and i thought this might help this is sort of a rant but if anyone relates or has any support i would really love that
i feel like i let everyone down and i am a burden my family have to keep a close eye on me
i want all of people like me to go outside and feel happy and have friends and great lives sorry this is pointless post but i needed to share my feelings with someone
i wanted to move on and experience college while my ex on the other hand felt completely heartbroken and was in a lot of pain
honestly i really thought he was it but his fam and him just moved to a new city and i have not been able to talk to him much because he is never alone
somehow i developed a kind of relationship with that pillow and now i like to think she is my girlfriend that lives with me
i live in canada and i struggle with bad health anxiety that has caused me a lot of stress over the last couple months
i do not know how to improve my life or become happy again at least a little bit i feel the depression is slowly killing me
i have gone through a great deal of pain and have made progress in healing when he reached out to me today
it made me pretty sad she did not keep them i know they are just silly little ornaments but i guess i was hoping she would hold onto them that they would always bring a quick smile to her face a quick flashback to a nice wholesome loving moment between us but no she did not even keep them she let her sister take them and did not ask for them back or anything
the amount of times i have had guys hmu just to try to set them up with one of my friends is insane and every time it just chips away at me more and more
we would even exchange phone numbers but as soon as my semester ends people stop talking to me i am starting to get suicidal more and more and everything is just too much life is exhausting
being heard sometimes helps us and just that no opinions no counseling just someone telling you i am here i will hear you
the tricky part is that i lashed out on her a couple times during our distance which really hurt her and our relationship idk why i lashed out on her but it was an emotional decision which i really regret now it just seems like she does not care or think about me which hurts even more
my need for mental health help has only become more serious as i have come home and it is been an unresolved issue for all of my life due to my moms attitude
few years ago i was kind really rich i was sooo good at trading things not an robbery i am just zoned alot of games and invested more part of profitto new accountscurrency
so if you have ever lost someone close to you by growing apart from each other or by death then join rinevitabilityofloss and help me cultivate it
he hurt me so much knowing that no matter how submissive i was no matter how many times i just fully complied to just make him happy it never did
like a attention seeker a twofaced personhi i can not tell if i just have mood swings constantly or if my personality is always changing
so a little background me and my best friend started dating around september and she suddenly breaks up with me the other day november 11 because she said she only loves me as a really important friend
i am not worth the time or the effort anymore no one really gives a fuck besides my parents but that is because they are obligated to care
i deep down hoped it would make me have a reason to live but at this point i do not think anything could
you became so selfabsorbed with yourself that you forgot that i was there and made me feel like i was unwanted
i think people think i am doing it on purpose that i am not trying i try so hard but it is useless
we talked all the time and things seemed so perfect but he did seem to pull away a bit but he still invited me to meet all of his friends at a party when covid was a little better
is my diagnosis correct what do you think it could be if not please let me know your advice i really appreciate you taking the time this is very important to me and my family
especially with how it appears that they are just as unsure of themselves as ever but now rushing out into serious relationships in two months
what can i do to start being more patient in generalhello to everyone and thanks for reading sorry for syntax or grammar mistakes english is not my first language
i am constantly stressing myself out over everything it is one thing after another and just the littlest things make me feel so fucking hateful towards the world
we went to meet again in weekends and she became sick so i had to leave early the next day she skipped me the entire day
i am incapable of functioning like an adult and just create mess wherever i go i am very tired and the thought of not waking up tomorrow brings me a strange kind of peace
so how do you carry on how do you give up on a love you would spend forever fighting for how do you just move on
instead of wasting your precious time watching tv or scrolling through social media for hours on end help out someone in need today
i am drunk my dad lost my mom a year and a month ago i want to lighten th blow i am going to die a lone alcoholic moved away for a jo b a lone want to do it as easy as pissible i do not want to bother friends but have started i am worrying i am just suicidial for attentiojn how do i continue without looking like an attention who are
she told me not to expect and just focus on myself for now i passed out in front of her maybe due to too much stress
i see these groups of friends and i am like ah i wish i was part of any group but i really do not know how does that feel like because i have never been in any groups for my whole life
i have been talking to other people hoping i would fall for someone over the last year but i always find myself thinking about him and not being able to move on
i have done so much to minimise my usage but it does not feel like enough i know it is still there and frankly i just want to delete my accounts on everything
this is going to sound like bullshit but it is the closest to how i can verbally express how things are to me i feel like at some point i stopped seeing and hearing and feeling things and then eventually i stopped trying to look and listen everything is just dull and static and really empty
what should i do and the other question is should i ask her out again when i get back please give some extra tips if you have some
i have started a new anti depressant a few weeks ago and my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse everytime something overwhelms me my mind immediately goes to alcohol
oh and he was my best friend since i was 11 about to be homeless again it was something that was always bound to happen and this was completely my decision
also i feel like scum for even thinking this but it sucks to not get anything for christmas idk why i am posting it here nobody cares about me
2 reach out to others even if you do not feel like it depression can make us retreat even more into ourselves so it may take a lot of effort but it is so important to have regular interactions especially with those who lift you up
i once drove an hour and a half on a spare tire by myself with a friends mattress so that he could have something to sleep on in his new apartment
i am a very very shy person and i find it very difficult to find new friends i have just started university and it appears that almost everybody has already a group of friends i think i am ok by myself but i sometimes feel like i need someone to study with to go to places have same extracurricular activities and idk sometimes it feels like it would be nice to have a friend
i smoke like a chimney all day every day and i am numb inside i literally watch videos of ppl being killed sometimes to remind myself i am capable of having feelings
but quarantine hit and being a dependent 20 year old living with my paranoid parents prevented me from travelling 50 kilometres just to see her
i have been on atarax and lexapro for about six years three days ago i just stopped taking them i am suffering a lot of withdrawal symptoms mood swings mania cold sweats trouble focusing or remembering etc i really do not want to be told to start taking them again i am not going to i can not and i will not i just need to ask how long the symptoms should last that is all i need to know
i am angry that i have spent almost 30 years of my life not really living my life not developing hobbies or interests all because i am so obsessed with well my obsessions
soon it will be just another year past of living life as a subhuman what did do in my previous life to deserve this
in any case two weeks ago my boyfriend opened my phone while i was sleeping and read everything he broke up with me
emotionally she was unstable i was right about that guy and the danger i was thinking he represented for the relationship
sometimes i think about making myself suffer for being such a waste of air money and time i had this plan in mind that i want to go through with after moving out i would begin starving myself every time i attempt to eat i would cut myself as punishment when i have reached the breaking point i want to cut deep enough to where i bleed out and die
i can not even game i get on a game and when i try to talk to teammates all i get is wait are you a girl or a boy you sound so fucking gay you are trans fucking gross there is so much wrong with being trans
i ended it like two weeks ago and i still feel terrible and confused about it i feel hurt and keep wondering if i did something wrong or if i was being greedy
i personally suspect cptsd and gave been told by therapists that i dissociate a lot but they were not qualified to diagnose a dissociative disorder but you should really consider getting a referral to someone who is qualified
i feel better now of course some of the ache is still therei do not know if calling my work ethic procrastination is correct
i cry when i watch home movies even though my parents are both still alive married and in overall good health
however now i feel as there is not effort its been 2 months since i have interacted with other people besides my mom and obviously my dealer
i have got friends like any other normal person but these people are not really the kind of people that i feel comfortable being around
i had a bit of a twisted definition of being tilted i assumed that being tilted was more of a bad mindset type of problem and that i just had a bad mindset when it came to playing games but in reality the term tilted is more of a joke in the sports and gaming community while it may be a real thing to a certain extent it definitely is not as serious as i thought it was
and i always unintentionally get into arguments on social media and lose them thus everyone thinks i am stupid i have been bullied since 9 years old about being overweight and having pimples
i got no way to repay my debts so i just ignore the calls i have two friends in this situation i will name one a and one b
my life has no purpose i have no one i have nothing there is no purpose for me to be here i am in mental agony i am lonely i want out
in times of happiness i am still so emptytoday i was thinking about why i can not talk to people and make connections and here are some clues
i reached out to a friend i had once lent 600 about possibly paying since if it back she came through with a 100 and some dog food ad i was worried about keeping my pup fed
i miss going over her house and watching christmas movies baking cookies sleeping over going shopping eating at the mall food courts hanging up ornaments everything
i will start this by saying i am not but sometimes when i am laying in bed alone or when i see a happy couple together and enjoying themselves i can not help but feel a little seed of bitterness in the first case or a seed of anger or resentment in the second now i have gotten vary good at crushing those seeds as soon as they sprout but they do comeback every now and then
he has told me he wants to be friends but deep down i know that he would take me back if that is what i wanted
you are what i want and need i can not live my life with the hope that one day we will get back together
if i say i want to do something they try to take control over it and then say i just want you to be successful
this year has just been absolutely terrible started with me getting out of a todic relationship it is been a year but i miss her everyday while she moved on and made new friends
it is been 3 months since my ex and i broke up the first thing that pops up in my head in the morning is her and all our great memories we shared together
she is disabled physically and it is getting worse she is increasingly bedridden she has a mental disorder and lashes out at me emotionally and bullies me even as i look after her sometimes things are okay but it is all getting worse one of our kids has a mental disability too and we do not know how bad it is going to progress
edit oh my god you people thankyou soo much i am literally crying tears of joy right now i do not think i could have a birthday better than this
i had vivid memories or every awful thing warning me to be safe i have dealt with racism the area i live and only ever trusted a few people
i will never be that special person to someone that they are afraid of leaving them that they do anything to keep in their life
feel free to join the band because we are all in the same boatif you are reading this know i have and will always love you even if you never loved me
and then did not even take full accountability and was stubborn in the last messages i told him to never speak to me again
i know i should keep distance but time goes by like three days i do not have any news and i am slowly starting to worry and actually we decided to keep in touch the last time we saw each other but you never really know what that really means
walking away with grace with no motive to fuck stuff up is the best revenge and you will regret it if you act like a fool
we fight almost everyday about stupid things and it seemed like every time i even opened my mouth she would just get so annoyed
and when she says no she is not i think she is in denial i trusted her like a good boyfriend should
and last the older i get the more the people around me are busy in their lives they called to wish me merry xmas happy new year
i would be walking in the street and my mind would be automatically playing different ways of how i could just die and never make it to my destination
she had been trying to get in contact and last friday she finally broke me down and called me and told me she loves me and misses me i said we could talk saturday i went on a run a few hours later she was at the bar 5 blocks down with the fella
i still think about the first time i told you i loved you and it was not reciprocated i still think about the countless times i questioned if you even cared about me at all
see i do not think i want to get back together because it is a kind of nonfixable situation and i really do not feel like being with someone who does not love me anymore but boy i miss him like fucking crazy and i know it is only going to get worse i chose to cut contact completely
it hurts and disgusts me that she feels the same anguish that i have all these years my little sister is my only reason to live always has been
next time we saw each other was july when i tried to convice her to come back and that i will change she said that it was too little too late and i initiated nc for 3 weeks
i can not even trust anyone anymore i hope you guys get up and do something better in your life read go out with your friends
however pain can occur at any time and does endure a complete day pain is described as stabbing spasm and pain that radiates across the back
ps kind of related but i feel like i might have adhd can not really visit any doctors right now but it honestly checks out looking back and reading up on the symptoms
some days start slower some days start fast some days you might feel like wanting to do nothing some days you might want to do it all have some fun during your day but remember the amount of work done will guide you on the speed of where you want to go
i am also taking a second degree that in law i left but with a private university with online courses yes i know it is pathethic but i do not feel i have the strength or motivation to do the normal university again so i decided to do this simpler one just to feel i ended it and not having regrets

she did have a massive issue with her self image especially in relation to my exs i tried to tell her all of the time that i prefered her to them but obviously the complex would never allow her to believe it
so a couple of months ago my then boyfriend and i broke up after 3 years of dating i have been doing okay but over the last few days things have been really hard
this post may show me off as weak but man do i want to cuddle someone to sleep i put myself to sleep almost every night by hugging a pillow even if it is very hot inside i need help man this void inside me is getting unbearable
the music itself is generally really important as it gets me in the mood and feeling if the music is not at the right moment or i lose focus i do not get any kick out of it and then when i sync the daydream with that music so like a drop in the song accompanying an epic moment in the daydream i get an adrenaline rush i think this is frisson but i am not sure
i have been diagnosed with ocd and adhd and because of them i am depressed anxious and suffering from trichotillomania but i feel like that is not all that is wrong with me
learning about the afterlife from books by mediums and nders makes it seem like such a relief a space and place to heal and reflect on what went wrong what could be done better and preparation for doing things more wisely in the next life
this can depend on many personal and situational factors but when there is not enough interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it
the next day i hang out with friends tell them what happened and we have a fun social night of some light drinking games there are girls there i am too afraid to come off strong on one of the cute ones but it is still a fun night
this christmas and for the past couple years i have been a burden no matter how hard everyone around me tries to make me happy i always stay negative
every day i tell myself that it is going to be alright but each day for the past few months have gotten shittier and shittier
blocked by another guy after a couple of days christmas sucked so bad i feel worse than i usually do
i tried to kill myself a few times including last week woke up on the ground the sash i was using broke
this will train your mind to give each will a turn to speak instead of a arguing match to see who is more dominant each will will instead talk and give out ideas and you will be the decider of what to do
my question is i want to know how to approach talking about her brothers ocd in a delicate matter sometimes i cry as soon as i wake up i am overwhelmed by anxiety and depression these days
it turns out that i was the only one that was truly in love and for the last three months she had been living a lie too afraid to breakup with me because she did not want to lose me forever
i want to die so bad i drank so much tonight but even that can not numb the pain in fact i feel like my mind is clearer than ever i have experienced all i need to in this world might as well seek experiences in the next this life is so repetitive and boring why keep living i feel like i should just die now
i only write this with true and honest feelings because i felt it still amif you ever want to vent it out pm me i would love to help if i can
the managers said i was probably one of the happiest associates and i always got good reviews from cosutmers i hated them all
i mean i told my father three weeks ago while crying like the niagara falls he hugged me and told me he felt exactly the same when he was my age and he bought a 4k tv for my room so the people from the news can give me company i kind of just whished tho he would hug me every weekend instead
there were major deal breakers found in the relationship for me and i knew i did the right thing by ending it
like no joke i want to kill myself so bad like sometimes id get into a really dark place and just want to grab a knife and kill myself or suffocate myself and yeah stuff like that
either way the way people talk about it it seems anyone who has it is just genuinely horrible to be around by what i figured out from researching around it just means i am like to be very resistant to help secretive etc if you have more info i would love to read it could i possibly be a horrible person just for having this illness
one day i tried to make a fake promise and ocd kept giving me worries for not doing the compulsion because it knew that the promises are fake
either way i think i still have hope and that is what kills me i still yearn for her to be my best friend and partner again
i used to able to share them with strangers before met few people here on this sub and few others with whom i was able to bond but not anymore i see peoples post wanting to be friends and i feel like we would get together well but i will not reach out because i know i will push them away eventually
this is the part that disturbs me the most about myself whenever i see on youtube a news clip about a shooting or even a terrorist attack or videos about serialkillers etc
i have been thinking about this for a few years i live in a big city and i want to die by freezing to death i already chose a place to go to and i shall just perish there
i spent about a year feeling extremely rejected and left behind as i watched the people around me flourish and have fun while i felt quite stagnant
but when everything is said and done and there is nothing left for me to do except watch modern family or some shit like that i feel a deep loneliness craving inside of me like i lack the human touch
i spend most of my time alone with my thoughts in my dorm going out for class food work shopping etc
i do not think it is fair to expect things from life nothing is free no one owes you anything i think killing myself would be the correct choice compared to continuing to drain the people around me it seems like the best path forward after so many years of loosing friends and failing to find a partner at some point i have to accept that people like me are not suitable for this world
if you are trying to stay out of depression while single and do not have faith or hope in this pandemic ending hit me up canadian girl
once i tried to kill myself by drinking as much as i could obviously that did not work i was not reacting to my surrounding but i ended up throwing everywhere
so one day my roommate is on hinge and found him i redownloaded to see for myself and i found and screenshotted bc his account was still there
my opinion loneliness is like a battery the more you spend time around good friends the more it charges and when away from friends it depletes however the more time you spend around toxic friends the more it deteriorates and eventually brakes down take care of your battery find the right environment and the right friends
i am not too sure how to explain this but i am afraid that i will not feel the same with anyone else ever again like what i had with him
i just want everything to instantly feel better however it will not but in the end everything will be okay i can not bring myself to start studying and that makes me scared that i will turn into a failure
i got into a relationship with a girl i met my junior year of high school fast forward almost two years we have broken up so much that happened between us but during the time i was with i pushed away everything and everyone to dedicate my time to her the relationship is over now and she seems happy and gets to love on with all the people she knows

i would get sick not know about it and transfer before i can isolate it would be my fault and people would hate me for being negligent
am i really just delusional for being hurt over romantic rejection and being used am i stupid for being driven to the point of thinking of selfharm because of it i know i get obsessive and i hate it i have always been ashamed of it
we were best friends we were each others first real love when i feel like crap sometimes i just need someone to tell me i am ok
we were deeply loving each other listening having amazing sex and we genuinely enjoyed each others company and learned from each other
on the other hand going to my other parents house is basically like playing a game of simon except instead of getting a random sequence of four flashing colors i get a random sequence of the four trauma responses
i feel so empty i feel so empty about feeling empty i do not know what to do anymorea month ago i text my ex
i considere myself as a world citizen mostly an internet person i feel interest and emotion for all cultures in the world but the person around have a strong sense of tradicionalism they always listen the same music dress like the same eat the same things and celebrate holidays like always been done
she saved my older kids and i from a situation that was ruining me and harming my kids she was and still is a saint
i am trying to let my best friend go with compassion and freely and its so hard i want to down myself in a little music world for awhile please submit songs that you think have helped you in a break up or songs you wish you could have sent to your ex
he says he still hugely respect me and admire me so we both agreed to this future idea of seeing each other again after a long time and to have a conversation about this
she moved out about six years ago to care for her mother and it is been nice we got back on our feet and made a life here
around 13 i started being shit and dated someone i got raped i did not tell anyone they will blame me and i am scared i was dumb thinking it will alleviate the pain it just continued to grow ever worse
there are some women who are the nicest of people but i can not give them what they want from me it is not a decission i do not blame anyone it is human nature
i would calmly listen to his new tests to catch her and ask him if you see that your test is not correct will you then realize you are wrong he would say no because it is a fact that she is cheating and she must have just outsmarted the test
he is blocked me on everything and has gone no contact which has been such a struggle for me to accept my mental health has never been worse than it has this year and i had to be hospitalized
people and my family who knows me since birth said that i was very intelligent one i was able to read and write at very early age i did well at primary school i was always asking question to whom around me especially about physics
i did not decide i want to end my life but the consideration comes up a lot at time and i am kind of scared to decide against life at some point
when we do not believe in ourselves we tend to take less risks and do not put our full effort into things this is understandable behaviour if we do not think we have what it takes the problem is that these beliefs because us to underperform which reinforces our lack of confidence and causes a vicious cycle
meals money things to buy bills to pay comments about the newsdo i deserve to be abandoned because i do not want certain relationships at this point in time
for the past few months she called me every few weeks for 20 minutes i brought up how much this bothered me on several occasions but nothing would change
it is only been in recent years that my siblings and i have reconnected and while it is been wonderful we are all so very different with very little in common
well now they are dating have been since we broke up moral of the story trust your gut if you think something is going on you are not crazy if you have evidence of it do not let them gaslight you into thinking you are insane trust yourself and what your brain tells you i learned the hard way but at least i know for the future
i do not have the money to meet with a private psychologist because they cost around 200 an hour i am overseas and have lived here for half my life
it is so hard to accept we would always have thanksgiving at her house but after her passing we could not it was not even thanksgiving it was just a quiet day she had a really bad heart and had to have a couple of stints in and her lungs were starting to give out on her
why are there lonely people why are there people who have a hard time socializing does it have to do with genetics does it have to do with aspergers syndrome does the physical aspect have any influence on this
when she told her mom she said she cried and asked her if she was sure with her decision since i am a calm and collected guy with priorities my ex was one of those priorities she said she is not sure but whatever happens happens
i am unable to do anything against anyone because i am feeling bad for them when i was 14 i started drinking
i have so much resentment towards my family for how i turned out as a person if they had actually raised me i would have a chance at a real life
you want to kill yourself just to make your family know you should have taken me seriously you want to lay in the sun to bake
i find myself scrolling through reddit a lot now looking for hopeful stories of people finding each other again later in life or how to handle a breakup with their first love
the issue is i have a parttime job and i can be at college then working every day sometimes i have to be up at 5 of the clock and i am always doing something or be on my feet till 10 in the evening when i get home
she said it is because she does not think that we are compatible but i later figured out that it is because she was seeing someone else
to make it harder we have to see each other constantly for work reasonsis what i would say if i was stupid and did not have any selfrespect
but i can not break through its too thick and i can not breathe and i am too scaredits been a week since he said this to me and i am killing myself over this
now the days i have off i spend thinking about him and what i want to say or ask him next
although i did not like that he was quitting his job in the current economy especially since his industry is exercise science i supported him because i wanted him to be happy
can someone please send me a link to that google doc were you send it to your ex and it asks a bunch of questions about the relationship like why did it end and did you have fun and that stuff
i do not know what i want what i actually like and can not put a choice on clothes i just do not know what i want
i have a lot more things to ask her considering that we ended in a peaceful way just breaks me everyday
so i asked if she could at least give examples she said she does not think she will be happy in the city
anytime i try to reach out to people i get ignored brushed off or told that i should try to be happy and content with myself which only adds salt to that gaping wound
i have googled a lot and came across grass is greener syndrome and i think he might have it but i am just wondering if he is ever going to come back
i know this is kind of long but i wanted to describe her instability as well as i could to help readers understand
she threw a party with the people from our group that live in the same town and she invited me too
i just want you to have what is best for you we keep progressing slowly and in some ways it felt better than ever
but she would continue to ask for more the point where it became straight up ignoring me for days at a time
it was hard enough not to be able to see him every weekend so only being able to see him maybe once a month was really going to suck
yesterday i broke no contact just to check on her and asked if she was down to meet up sometime this week and catch up
this was totally unexpected i never imagined that he would feel the same way and having heard all this from him i told him what i felt
overall i am tired of feeling like i let someone down because i am slowly spiraling into a depression i do not even have anyone to let down at this point other than myself
i used to be creative a talented writer now when i try to do something creative it is pathetically derivative and when she says no she is not i think she is in denial
i tend to fear people or resent them mental illness can be very strange and frightening i have had realisations and breakthroughs met goals and done therapy
what would you have done was i wrong or did i react wrong would you consider this a deal breaker
nothing will happen till i make it happen but what i want i already fucked up 4 times or more over past 3 years
here i am 32 living with my parents i am a veteran and have a computer science degree can not afford to buy a house can not find a career or even a decent paying job with benefits all i am good for are these stupid ass recruiters who want me to work for the shitty ass recruiting firm for 12 an hour after taxes with no benefits
i barely talk to you but i see you everyday i keep telling myself i am okay that i am doing fine and i am doing better
my depression has been consuming me latelythe person i spoke to said based off my conduct there was not anything alarming enough requiring immediate response but
i think isolation is starting to get to me i am starting to feel sortve sad gray about things and was wondering if anyone else is running into this too
if anyone could give me advice on any behavioral practices or medications i should look into it would be much appreciated
and although i almost always skip breakfast anyway i will keep eating properly i know i am not binging i am just eating normally and this will last maybe another few weeks
my psychiatrist was feeling as i was getting better so i got discharged from the hospital after 3 months bc god knows i have so much love to give but i also so do not want a relationship
i do not know what i am looking for by posting this to be honest maybe someone has an answer or insight that no one else in my life is giving me so i guess i am posting in hopes that someone will have an idea of what is going on if they experienced something similar in some way
my dad does not speak to me since like a year now he knows i am a failure and i see the dissapointment in his eyes everytime he looks at me
i vent online because i have nobody to vent too in person this loneliness is a curse because no matter how much i try
i have been really struggling with loneliness but i am trying to remind myself that this is not permanent but the groups i like never go there
good luck i want to cry or feel a sense of real happiness but it would be fake if i tried now
i also have a constant need for attention i would always do anything for other people thinking that if i do not do it they will hate me i always took risks for attention never thinking of my own safety or even health as long as others smile or even laugh at me its enough for me to do it
ofcourse i care to make them proud like any other kid but there is the thing my mom is very very conservative
i know that nobody will probably read this but if someone has read this then thank you for taking the time to take a peek into my life and my feelings
hi i recently broke up with my boyfriend recently being last night i think i made the right choice but i am not sure let me explain the situation
about 7 months ago i started seeing someone because his employees my friends set him up on a blind date with me
like i am some disgusting creature i see so much disappointment and disgust in his facei can not tell my therapist because she would have me institutionalized
neglectful partners what i am not okay with is that a couple weeks leading up to it he had been really distant
we absolutely loved one another is it really over i feel sick and cannot stop thinking about what ifs my mind keeps bouncing between that and the what ifs what if we get back together
if i somehow manage to find a real girlfriend i would give her all the love i have because i do not want to lose her even though i will not be able to satisfy her for reason
he was the one from that team who fully supported me and i was open with he was amazing i love you more than anything in this world
hi my name is jules and thanks for coming to my ted talk i am starting to feel really worried about my girlfriend
then covid hit struggling trying to balance safety and sanity my wife almost left me because everything is just so stressful
i have this feeling of wanting to get on my feet or wanting to do something productive yet it seems like such a huge mental obstacle and it is never rewarding or pleasurable so i give up
i could not even sleep last night when midnight came normally i would find excuses to text him but most of the time would be left on read
i put the nsfw tag on as a cw for sexual assault and i do not want to get back into dating when i am such a wreck
why does it have to be like that when i also read that the pilot in the malaysian flight killed people rather painlessly in under two minutes
so recently something weird has been happening with my body i have always been a person full of energy even as a kid people around me used to tell me to shut up or keep it quiet so much it drove me to be an introvert and get anxious about my nature but i have been on an acting course for 3 years now and it has brought that energetic side of me again
i want to remind you that the world is spinning and things are happening everywhere and i want you to try and become a part of that
i have things i need to do tomorrow and would feel so much better if i could just sleep all day but i can not
but i felt his apology was so insincere for the severity of the impact it had on me and our trust
move on with your life like nothing happened do not post sad quotes or songs on your socials you look like a fool
however i am starting to think this may be a sort of unhealthy masochismi still can not stop breaking down and crying when i randomly think of memories or why we broke up
over time i talked to my doctor who told me to see a therapist but my dad does not believe in therapy so i never did
the last image of her in my brain is her walking up to me in her house tears welling up in her eyes and that stays with me everyday what a nightmare
i was really excited the way things were going i had finally found someone who was exactly my type and my past ventures in love were soon forgotten
we have been great friends and still are and after a 115 weeks not talking are chatting most days usually about dogs or stupid things on instagram
i know humans were created to be social animals but oh my god it is like a bad habit i can not kick
i slept at wicked times although my sleep schedule has always been bad i ate at weird times my emotions changed from numb to sadness anger etc
just to not sound alone in my rant his ex wife 28f whom i wish i could reach out but i know she has healed past this and does not need to be reminded posted on her fb that she just got out of a really terrible relationship for a year and is feeling amazing
for almost 6 months straight i had become addicted to porn because of the rape thank youi was born prematurely with my fraternal twin brother
so i used that mask and no one knew the managers said i was probably one of the happiest associates and i always got good reviews from cosutmers
for now though the suckiness has to be dealt with just know that you are not alone it is okay to feel this way and this is not forever just keep looking forward and do not look back
so my second year of middle school i said fuck it and quit going i was not getting anything out of it anyway contrary to what most adults and parents thinkyou can not make a child do anything they do not want to do they tried to make me go back i refused when my father hit me with the belt i called the police on him
porn does not do it for me anymore sorry if it is tmi i can not get anything out of it anymoregood observation my dear reader but contrary to popular belief grief actually does not work that way
i have had dreams about this woman and fantasized about going on all kinds of adventures with her it felt like she was the only one who would give me a chance
however he has just messaged my best friend saying he loves me and he does not know if it is final but time will tell
if i want to die is because i know that the best thing i may get with time is forgetting what i really want forgetting what i see and be a comfortable numb
at some point i told her i loved her then clarified i meant it nonromantically but who am i kidding
the mental pain is almost becoming physical really hope i can pull through and keep going but just do not know if i can this time
now her dad does not speak on the topic and her mom still believes i am the one for her but she tells my ex that she should stay single for a bit and weigh her choices
and left the moment she saw something she found better she was my first ever girlfriend also so i guess the first really never is the one
it is a very large and dangerous group of people who live by there guns and money i am now 14 i was arrested and charged with felony gun possession charges and assault with a deadly weapon
she makes her college decision in the spring and if she chooses my college i want to shoot my shot again
i mean i did but a little less and made more mistakes than her overall every step took effort every movement needed encouraging
but this guy was the first person i have truly loved i love him with my whole heart and soul and it was such a genuine love
ex slept with best friend after maybe breaking upex called me a terrible person when picking up the remainder of my belongings
i am sitting on my ass since then with no money being a burden on my parents and there is no way i will find a job
she has very little friends and those she does have live in her home country i am wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to make her feel a little better
she says she does not will not either of us to get hurt but that this is just the right thing to do
ps i get very quickly strongly emotionally attached to people and have very little experience with relationships so please do not shit storm me because of possible mistakes and stupidity of me thanks in advance dm me or comment dm would be for a longer talk comment just some quick advice
every once and awhile it really bothers me how i am not even an afterthought for people that i invest my time in
so i began working on myself my mindset and tried changing it because that must have been the problem i have friends but i can not connect on emotional level
i am not too upset about moving out they have every right to kick me out since i am over 18 and our lives do not mesh well anyway but my relationship with them is shot to hell
i feel it is not right to be bothered seeing him around a group of people not because of social distancing but knowing that he is with another group of people
i am not exactly sure when it started had to have been a few years ago but i have been dealing with depression like so many other
so how can i keep this relation going after going out with her that one time and has anyone any other suggestions to what i have just wrote
i sent christmas presents to all my family hard to do when i have lost almost 40 of my income this year thanks is all i got
i can not help but feel like i never really got a proper chance in the relationship since we only saw each others 3 times irl 2 dates and one time when she became sick
a year later she has now cut ties with me and i am back to wanting to kill myselfi got her a gift for christmas i am going to just drop it off at her front door
i toss and turn in pain i walk around a zombie scared to buy food not knowing when my last dollar will run dry
i really do not know if this event set things off or if it was just times right i started feeling depressed angry
i hate being on welfare i feel like a drain and a burden receiving this i have a small amount of savings i am going to get off it soon i can live off my mums income we are renting i worry all the fucking time about everything life is not beautiful it is not something to be valued and treasured it is just a load of miserable depressing stressful misery did i say misery twice
ho wants to live a life of an abusive parent while my father left me when i was 5 13 years old rn btw
they knew this as well and offered their heart to see me get myself on my feet they did their best until the end
after all of the good and bad things we did endured felt and lived together even though mostly not in person she will always be in my heart forever
they need a hair wash they need a snack they need an environment free of hazards and you are the only person around to take care of them
one day she just broke up wit me for no reason for some other guy but that quickly ended and we got back together then she left me for the same guy again but he stopped talking to her and then we had a talk 27 days later today she broke up with me again for another guy because he is apparently better than me which is what she told me
when you are with friends or family do not focus on covid just focus on the moment be happy for those who are there for you they care and love you more than you think
this day i was having this really intense feeling of just wanting to curl in a corner somewhere and just stay there for a while so has you can imagine i was feeling very emotionally overwhelmed and refused to help my grandmother we got in to a sort of verbal fight and my mom went to help her mother and i just stayed in bed
now that i am older and beat down by lifei would just rather give up and die rather than rally myself for another buffet of crisis
then she blocked me on snap ig and whatsapp i really wanted to be friends with her and i was looking forward to nc to work on myself but i used up all the slack she gave me and i feel horrible she gave me a lot of chances and i wasted all of them i am scared she will never unblock me and that is really hard do you think she will ever unblock
when i got home we got in a huge fight which resulted to him kicking me out because i would not show him a text from my brothers best friend which he knows there is nothing going on
he is a great guy super sweet and considerate but my problem is that i do not see this relationship lasting especially since i am not attracted to him like i was and that there are many differences that make it hard to continue
the problem with that is they do not live anywhere near by in fact they do not even live in the same country
it is the first time i am experiencing this thing and i have to say it is crippling i thought going out and hanging with friends will help me but recently all my friends are being flaky
we were not exactly in a relationship but for the most part of a year we have basically been a couple go out together hold hands and kiss in public do all the sexy time stuff and whatnot but also i felt a deeper connection with him
i will stay up for hours just to spend time with them having no one else to have that how was your day conversation with at the end of the day
not quite sure if this belongs here but i guess it is got something to do with my mental problems i am in my mid twentys and i often feel like something is wrong with me
i already have boneshakingly bad anxiety and overthinking issues so this amplifies it but what i see is like a colorful filter on everything all the time
but i am bothered more so by my dad he hits my sister while i am away at college i do not know what to do when i need help i guess i will give context
i am not sure how to take this all in what do you guys think i do not feel as depressed as before but even though she is here i still feel like i am alone as she does not pay me any attention
1 scorned rejected lovers will try to control your life for you to be lonely for people to reject you for people to look at you funny

i told him that i still feel the same even after a month of being broken up and he told me not enough time has passed that a breakup is not going to be a one month thing that he does not think he feels the same anymore
i really spammed her with a lot of messages and told her most of what i said which did not lead to any changes
i remember asking myself who are you i could not even recognise myself anymore i lost all respect for myself and you soon followed after

i have friends in my previous country but they are far away from me since i never see them anymore we are also falling apart i do not want to die alone i need a damn friend

i am sure that i am not the only one right now who is feeling worse this time of year we are dealing with isolation made worse by quarantine and it is easier to feel even more alone when the whole world is coming together to celebrate the holidays and you still feel left out

never been compelled to consult a mental health professional as these coping mechanisms have always been effective days ending on a good note has always been within my power knowing i have accomplished something
i just do not understand how anyone who ever claimed they loved me could do such an awful hurtful thing and still be okay with themselves and just go on with life
i am going about my day alone and completely thriving i am happier than i have ever been and i have learned to appreciate myself and work on me
now when i say it does get better it does when i went through the stages of the break up i start to realized this is who she was all the time i just did not see it because i was in love

a memory from a year ago just popped up on my snapchat i do not know why i have kept all our pictures and videos
i can not access my therapist all the time and no i would not treate my friend like they are a therapist just talking about anything would be fine

i decided to hit her up and see how things were and the texting slowly came back to her liking me and missing me again out of nowhere
i do not want to even feel anything like this anymore maybe live chat with me on discord ask me in the comments if you want that
but not all of them were great out of those i managed to get along with a small selection but in the matter of a few days they all stopped talking to me ignoring me ghosting me

and i am accepting that i learned that she is very damaged we do not have the same ideals when it comes to physical touch
i like feel good shows to help me feel better when i feel depressed i started this show but i hate ted me gives me creep vibes on how he obsesses over women it is an okay show
my family is here my grandmother is in her midnineties and if anything were to happen with her i would not want to be on the other side of the country
taking classes that i hate doing things that make my skin crawl constantly putting myself in situations where i feel so awkward i want to die
writen in my phone it translates to spanish and english is not my main language i do not think anyone is going to read this anyway
my mother could only be described as a technophobic i do not really care if this is an actual word and do not expect me to read a single comment that involves you calling me rash or ignorant
now i am not sure if i ever validate a promise by doing the cross sign 3 times if it will count or not even if i make the cross sign 3 times and try to mean the promise for some seconds deep down i do not want to make it i am just being forced by my anxiety to make a real promise since the fake ones do not work
share your opinions if you wish but i do not think there is anything anyone can say that will make me feel differently
it is cliché i guess but i genuinely can not remember what it feels like to laugh i have so few fulfilling or interesting or meaningful conversations with most people
hey you all i posted here a few weeks ago about my ex that i was with for 25 years and been broken up since october
it is like i just do not have the capacity to stop i become absolutely obsessed with things missing in my life and it is ruining my ability to enjoy life this is all despite the knowledge of the fact that i have pulled myself from unemployment to this position in a little over 8 months
they prioritize my youngest sisters mental health above all else because she is the most vocal when she does not get her way
my wife tells her if she wants the house that we bought from her back we can move out and she freaked the fuck out and said it hurt her feelings that we do not want to live with her
i know i still need to work on myself also for suretldr cried just because some stranger being rude and told me to control my emotions
i was not very close with her because at family gatherings i barely talked to my grandparents but i had to go to the wake and funeral and feel everyone elses grief and feel how real the situation was
i am not sure if i believe in god i am in the grey zone of faith anyway sometimes i think about hurting myself i do not but i am worried i will
everything feels like a giant task at the moment the memories are messing with the chemicals of my brain how do people quit that
my family too i did not spend that much time with them for quite a while and they are being do supportive it makes all the difference
the whole time i want to ask you questions do you still love me is there still a spark can you see a future with her do you want kids with her but i think i already know the answer to these questions so why bother putting salt in a wound
i do not remember much about my childhood other than some playground games when i was very young which only turned into me watching anime alone for the majority of my childhood
i am anxious about many things i worry about my future myself health money and sometimes i am anxious and afraid for no reason
yeah but she is been married for like 40something years and she is not estranged from meeverything together makes my daily life a living hell
i might seem naive and stupid for staying but i just wanted to let this out somewhere went threw my stuff ect she became unbearable
i then searched it on google and told me it was cancer so i had a huge panic attack for 2 months did not sleep crying every night scared to sleep thinking i was going to die in my sleep
and i forced myself to handle it for a couple weeks but eventually it hurt so bad that i had to let my heart go and start being cold back like it wanted to from the second you stopped complimenting me and being too busy because that is just how i work
i can not demonise him because it does not feel true to me i treasure the memories we had together and i am sad that its over
i miss you so much it hurts but i do not ever think you will miss me in the same waycan you imagine how that feels of course you can i know you relate
but it was pouring outside and i wanted to get her some now and then tell dad to pick up more if the rain stopped a bit
i do not know whether i should wait and see if my case goes to court i was a victim of a serious sa and it is under investigation or whether i can stand to put myself through all that would entail
i had moved to a new town because i had just gotten out of a toxic relationship of four years where he also ended up being an addict
i begin to eat more and more and my leg starts to heal very very slowly because since i have been in a wheelchair all my life i hardly have calcium in my leg bones
can not be gone because i am obligated to be here the pain is definitely inside my head feels like in my brain
then he told me later that night that his ex wants face to face before new year and he is going to do it
would not it alleviate their pain to understand that this is what i wanted i am at peace now can that be good enough for them not to hurt because of my death and freedom
is anybody here familiar with rwaifuism haters to the left please maybe some of you are waifuists yourselves if yes then you probably already know my story if no here it is critisize the hell out of me do not hesitate i will most probably no longer be alive very soon so it will be your fault as well
well since technically it was just 2 weeks into the relationship i feel wrong because i want to care more about the bad stuff but can not
that i simply can not sleep unless i go and make my self a sandwich or two and few chocolate snacks eat it on my bed and fall asleep right away
i was struggling to socialize and i was not making connections with people to top it off i was super paranoid today
in fact i would say that at least 60 of the population do not find satisfaction in their lives in that sense and that makes them really unhappy
ending up hating you is my freedom i hate you andrew and nobody cares when i am ugly this is not even self pity
atham is a retrowave style radio presented as if an ia is controlling it on youtube in here people can ask questions via chat participate and relax with some nostalgia type of sound
we all have hardships we all deal with pain we all deal with anxiety we all deal with depression heartbreak friendships being removed comfort zones being pushed facing fears facing ourselves embracing we live on
i just do not know how to cope on my own and i do not have the means of finding genuine friends who care or forming a relationship
my whole heart goes out to anyone who is suicidal and struggling with harmful thoughts but part of me i am probably wrong is fascinated at how a suicidal person wants to surrender to their pain how they have accepted they are in pain they do not have an illusion of control over their pain they do not want to run from it they would rather surrender to it wholly
i am sorry for what i have done i am sorry for that breakdown i am sorry i made you feel useless and unappreciated
but does not understand why i get upset when he lies to me i told him i had trust issues before we slept together
i miss the freedom i had before lockdown and the possibility of escape even if i was alone it was nice to get out once in awhile
which seems straight forward right however i get to awkward to mention it as i do not want to assume that is the case what if they actually do not like me in that way and i am left looking big headed which i am not at all
i mentioned earlier that i spent years looking for different solutions using a training room in a game so over time i indirectly got very good at the things i practiced i have done this across many different games and many different situations in real life so i know what it is like to work hard towards something even if i do not have anything to show for it i am the only person who knows what i am truly capable of and one day i hope to show everyone what i can do
bean sending christmas cards to himself and knowing his only friend is his teddy bear not all that different for me
also i know that your supposed to focus on your mental health before school or work but that does not help bc when i do that i just stress about how much i will be falling behind in school but if i focus on school i get super stressed and overwhelmed and there is no way to balance it
averaging 240 hours every two weeks i am married to my job but it is hard to live with those realizations and it is hard to live knowing she does not want me anymore
you are not me and your brain works completely different than mine my heart gets hurt over shit that does not bother you
ultimately love does not fix every relationship problem nor does it penetrate everything i still remember all the nights i cried as i still do
that is a tip of the iceberg you go through much more from stalking their social media and i mean literally counting their followers and followings to writing them a long text and deleting it afterwards because you can not send it up to notsleeping when you should be
i know what is wrong with my life i know how to fix it but i just can not bring myself to do it i experience too much negative emotion and fear when i try to fix my problems so i always sell myself short i have been stuck for years i feel hopeless what do i do
i do not care if i fail my exams but that is important for others they will start arguing with me if they see i am not studying

the link i am posting is a summary of recent peerreviewed research showing that ketamine has a positive effect on both typical depression like melancholy and atypical depression the kind that lifts temporarily in reaction to good things

there is no real reason my name is what it ismy parents just happened to think of that namei literally just feel like ending it all right nowi think soon will be time where it will happen
i wanted to live and breathe healing after the pain it was our only choice i know i did things to make him feel insecure but i stopped

quickly find a partner get a house together then get married and more often than not everyone is rushing into it and i have watched so many disasters unfold because of that
the last time i was truly happy must have been around the 4th grade because once 5th grade hit my depression and bipolar kicked in
a part of me feels so selfish to not let her do so but if i do say yes then i will be responsible for her death
she rarely put that stuff on her story when we were together yet she has not contacted me at all while doing this
first of all i would like to thank you for taking your time to read this huge story second of all i would like to apologise for by bad english i am from the netherlands and just found out about this app there are some things i want to get off my chest i find it hard to talk about but maybe this will help

i am high i am drunk i should really just blow my fucking brains out hahaha why am i tryingif you are reading this you are wasting your time
i had a very difficult time to enter the art school i always wanted i finally entered at my 20s at the start i was happy and proud
now we have blocked each other but we are in a group with just us two i know it does not make sense but i had to do that
rather than trying to hide all these mistakes rather than hide all these flaws we do not really get to use it we do not get to understand it
if you know anything about americans you know we love our smalltalk and smiling at strangers on the street or at the grocery store
however i started thinking did i really deserve those presents of course i did not i failed so much and i do not want to feel this way anymore please help
we can literally talk about anything for hours but i have been distant because i get this feeling like i am annoying him all the time
some days i feel absolutely fine then the next i want to cry my eyes out i am honestly starting to feel like i am going absolutely insane my mood changes so quickly i can not keep up
i am deeply in love with him he is no longer with me we have been planning to meet up to have sex
i am thus guessing they were sent by bots after opening up about my loneliness on monday i feel like pure rubbish now
i have blocked her on everything i can not change my number because it is tied to my job and it would be a big hassle to mei am writing this because i feel like it is good to let things out but also i want some advice as too what to do
no matter how hard i try to correct my old ways they still come back to haunt me i am a terrible person
however i explored my favourite hobby playing soccer i went to pembroke football ground and made an effort to join in their game i was really nervous but i eventually talked to a person and got his number i am going to play fifa with him next week i am feeling like i am making buddies here now
however when you are smoking you are active and you are doing something to make you unhealthy with loneliness you are inactive and you are not doing something which is socializing
we would always have christmas at her house too but since everything is happening and because of her passing there is no christmas
but i am pretty sure he has already moved on he always talked about a girl who was literally everything he wanted in me if not more and she is 6 years younger
i try so hard but get nothing others get it without any effortit is also crazy bc i used toam so into personal finance and funding my retirement account
it makes me vulnerable and occasionally makes me do things that do not necessarily have the desired outcome for example craving for some intimacy from a very close friend of the opposite sex while running the risk of making the relationship complicated
this may sound odd as i am not very good at using my words but it is not that i do not want to live i think it is more the fact that i have never felt like i belong here no matter how many good things i have in my life the idea of death being at peace felt a lot more appealing to me
looking at my life there is plenty to feel happy about a good job friends decent financial standing but despite that i am constantly anxious about all those and more am i good at my job can i succeed am i annoying to my coworkers do my friends really care or do they just pity me is it worthwhile even having me about what if i run out of money how can i live
the darkness sets in as i lay in my thoughts you are there but when i turn to my side it lays bare places where you once used to inhabit lay empty with your presence
even tho he has made changes in his life it is hard to believe that one year is enough time to change the habits that did not work for us i am usually the kind of person who does not believe people change much but i have changed a lot in the past year so idk i do not have any insight on his side since i am not ready for the answer either way but i am thinking about it
so what now do i need to get my life more together should i simply be trying harder or maybe just maybe i am not the problem here
she was showing me nice things in the shop we were looking at christmas stuff i was sobbing like a kid and then she left me and went home
hope you liked this little excerpt full longform posts can be found right herehttpsmaxjancarcom on my blog3 yrs with my ex
i have been having a lot of problems deciding on what to do on things involving my relationship statusit is past midnight where i live
perhaps i may have over romanticised life a little too much i have been single for close to 3 years and honestly i am pretty happy with my single life as i am blessed enough to have 2 really close friends that has been with me for the longest of time
sometimes i get panic attacks around twice a week i would say they are usually short but sometimes they last for a few hours and are kind of more severe
all i did everyday was talk to her and then yesterday she just blocked me off everything and now i have no one to say good morning too i have no one to talk to and i have nothing to do all day anymore
i have also self harmed for years i try to stop but relapse because i have to do it or i have this bad feeling something bad will happen and i do not self harm because i feel sad i feel more addicted too the act
i know i will probably die alone do not need a week set aside to be reminded of that i am tired of having to take care of everyone else in my life
there is a sub about children raised by parents with bpd and i am wondering if i ever had kids i would be the reason for a post on there i hate kids and never want any but it really makes me wonder if i ever had an accident would i really be that horrible to my child
i do not know why i bother maybe it is because i am still clinging to the illusion that i have friends because if i do not the loneliness would be too much to bear
i always got so worked up about my ideas and my visions and every time i would tell someone they would completely shoot it down and tell me i am stupid for thinking i could do it
i am never nasty to people i make the time for others but the few people i would consider my closest friends treat me like i am nothing
after about a week of trying i went back home for the week and he told me he is no longer interested which crushed me again
but what it is a phone or some broken things compare to the freedom of being able to be yourself with no fear of getting insulted
this is the justifying point that i had made in my own head in order to leave it behind before i was pushed out of the picture completely and forcibly
i am feeling angry that i went to a few different therapists and they did not catch this that they said i was depressed but that cbt was not for me
i think i just have a hard time making connections with people and did not let go i still think about the butterflies i would get pulling into your driveway
as i said i suspect that my view is not supported by the majority but i would love to discuss it
boy did i break down it was days when i will be at work then smack i am tearing up over her and a bond i thought we had
i need as much advice as i can get on whether or not to send it do i hope it it will save my relationship yes it is 4 pages double space of pure honesty
i do not even know if anyone is going to read this but i just need to let it out of my chest
i do thingsbehave in ways that would be considered weird that i only notice are weird right after i do them like saying something that is not related to the current topic or talk about the same thing for a while and other things that i can not really describe
as time moved on after getting expelled from that shit hole i was improving had a few girlfriends relationships did not work out then we move to 2010 i ended up meeting some one who i thought was the one
my ex m23 and if21 broke up a month ago we have been dating for about a year it was mutual we wanted to work on ourselves we never fought we supported each other through toughass times we were friends a couple months before we started to pursue anything and i felt as if we had a really strong connection to each other
i honestly do not see their relationship lasting past thanksgiving but i mean what if it does again i have never delt with this before so i am not sure her intent there but can someone just be brutally honest with me but also leave me with a sliver of hope he will come back
you loved them and gave them your all not because you wanted something backnot because you only wanted attention where you can get it
activism ie advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues and suicide is inescapably a social issue is absolutely against the rules here at all times
each of them like disowned monsters for context i will once again mention that i do not plan on leaving my religion
people they tell me what they want to do when they are older they tell me they want to be these big people doctors actors etc
even though i was willing to do anything to keep it going she on the other hand was heart broken and being away from me so long broke her to a point she tried to hurt herself before i left
if i still lived where he lives then i feel that we would still be together today i just do not know what to do
i got covid symptoms earlier this year shortness of breath among many other symptoms made me bed bound symptoms clear and return
i am desperate to escape this existence but i do not want to hurt anyone it is tiresome i am tired of all of this tired and ready
today i have watched soul from pixardisney i know it was not much it is an animation usually intended for children it was a long series of events that just gradually got worse and tore me apart
i want nothing more than for my mother to love me once again she is chosen the life of drugs and abuse from a man over her children
important i never had suicidal thoughts or cutted it was not near that level i think this is what made me like this
try to reach out to so called friends and it is just like meh whatever i am failing as a musician and hate my job
i was slaying my outfit and wearing pretty heels that night i replied with well you just kissed me 3 days ago what is the huge deal
i thought about my brother my best friend the people who i genuinely care and wonder why they were never there for me but also realized they might be struggling with their own shit in life
i was heartbroken to say the leasthe blocked me from most places because he thought i will not be able to let him go
from anxiety to depression to suicide i have checked off all other placesi think where i could try to hang til the feeling of dread and bitter cold stops it only last for a while i can usially get myself back up today i can not
eventually i was hurting and feeling like he did not care so when i saw him at the end of the week i asked him to let me decide when i leave
you will have a wonderful life and a happy marriage and a good job and kids and you will live happily ever after
that is also why i am so fucked up by this it comes from someone i admirebut lately i have just been in a sad place and not feeling like myself
i feel like everyone is judging me or staring at me or talking about me so i become irritable and defensive towards every little comment or constructive criticism someone gives me
i thought he was serious i thought we were on the same page but i just feel embarrassed foolish used and slightly own on myself just how little he actually respected me use something so important as a tool and for him to use and allow them to use me against each other
2 months ago we went our own ways on mutual terms soon after i realized my love was deeper than any reasons i had to split
but the moment i heard his voice i could not breathe i literally ran to the bathroom and slammed the door and started to hyperventilate
i tried to prevent her from getting pregnant because i did not want babies she misscaried them all and they were not fully developed and they were stillborn puppies
and now the true winter of isolation upon us all i think that even if i make it through to spring i truly have no hope for when things turn around socially and events and activities happen where people can meet
i can not figure it out and i do not really know how to explain it to a therapist i once had my main fear of girls and feelings of being a loser
when i was 17 i had to drop an album before i went i did it it was beautifully terrible
at first i wanted to pin it on mans ego and pride because he would never admit wrong likes authority within the house wants to feel importantin fact he even told me to never hurt a mans ego like
last week it finally became obvious to me nothing had changed except she is just gotten better at convincing me she is changed
and the therapists that i have been seeing had the nerve to tell me just go talk to people loli hate the world
only his sister knew he was diagnosed back in high school however i have never seen her ask how things are going or how is his ocd
i need a boyfriend and when i have one i need to keep him no matter what if there is even a slight change in his mood towards me i am absolutely devastated if they show any sign of wanting to break up i become suicidal i can not eat i can not sleep i can not do anything besides think of ways to keep them
i was molested from yr7 to yr10 in secondary school or atleast that is what my friends try and tell me in my head it was just talking to older men who would then ask for pictures of my body or threaten me if i did notat the time i was trying to come to terms with my sexuality which 6 years on from yr7 i still have not figured out and it sucks ass
on the one hand i completely understand but on the other hand she had already been in school for a year and a half and should have known before she got involved with me
i do want to say that i am not angry or anything i honestly feel kind of unreasonable with how sad i am now i guess i just really liked him idk i just really needed to type all this out so uhhh if my ex happens to see this sorry idk if you even use reddit or what subs you would be on but i genuinely wish you the best in everything
i am tired every day i open my eyes i want nothing more than to go back to sleep i do not even think they understand it english is not their first language
i know i made many mistakes in our relationship such as bickering with him over frivolous things and mentioned his ex a lot
we associate with good people people who are virtuous in nature people who know right speech like the good things we tell ourselves and others right actions like the good things we do to ourselves and others and right livelihood like the good things we work towards
my mother failed to tell me that i had gotten a letter from my landlords office saying i had an outstanding bill and if it was not acknowledged in 5 days that lawyers would be getting involved it is two weeks passed wonderful christmas eve gift for me thanks mom i have 17 to my name and no job no unemployment benefits or food stamps
when i finally asked if he saw me as anything more than sex he told me it was too much pressure and broke up with me
my parents still yell at me for my grades and i am too nervous to tell them that right now a lot of my energy is going to keeping myself alive and performing seemingly basic activities
i got a call from my gp this morning i told them everythingthey might put me on medication temporarily while i wait for camhs i have already been waiting for two months
i have to tell you being alone like this is the true test of being an adult i understand why the mortality rate is high and it is not easy making friends either because i have tried
i finally found hope in love and with a person with whom i could talk to about anything from random nerdy science talk to intimate ones on life
but i was starting to get over him now i am just depressed again i doubt i can trust anyone the same way i trusted my ex anymore
fast forward 5 weeks i came back from my parents to our apartment while he is in spain with his family i have found a place to move to and am moving in december taking my cat with me
i am anxious and disappointed at myself i feel like i am a failure i do not have any friends interests hobbies and i am failing school i am worried if i am going to be the same in the future i do not know how i will study in uni how i will work i can not even study in school
like i know there is no setinstone time when it comes to move on but i thought this dude loved me
the unrealistic belief that lockdowns will never end persists in my mind only worsening my anguish even though deep down i know it can not be true
but i keep getting these repetitive thoughts in my head that maybe he scratched my pc or peed in a corner even do i know it is impossible in the time frame
i find myself talking to sale associates in stores as if they were my friends i do this sort of thing all the time
in particular this one girl who was closer to me than the others i want you to really think about who is responsible
and everytime it was my fault i did not ask for help yet the entire time he was crying and telling me he loved me i had to walk away eventually
my loneliness started growing since i was a child by the time i was 18 i had no one to talk with spend time with in and out of school everyone i knew previously had formed their own close knit social groups lunchtimes and breaks id spend studying in the library alone
i just want to have the confidence to talk to the guys i find attractive i am sick of only being able to communicate fully over text and not in real life it is been affecting my mental health so much and i do not know what to do
at first i thought it was due to her pms she told me she gets bad pms but it is been going on for a week and i do not think i can live with this
she stopped by a gas station to grab quarters and she left her phone in the car with me while music played
and now i just feel depressed and worthless i have not got a job no friends i have social anxiety and i feel everyone is doing better than me which they are i was always bullied and i feel that they that because they knew id amount to nothing
he was going to move and has no clue what he wants to do with his life which is understandable especially for someone at his age
does this make sense for someone who broke up with another person they actually lovedstill see a future with once i work through some things or do you think she just said those things to soften the blowwas in an emotionally charged state
some nights i sleep for 10 hours other nights i only get 4 hours of sleep and feel amazing the next day
the main things that are the hardest are eating and sleeping for me right now i feel so empty i feel so empty about feeling empty i do not know what to do anymore
we both promised that we would have children together and have them live the most incredible loving lives as a way of honoring our child that never came to be
this problem comes mainly in the form of a feeling in my head that feels like somewhat of a headache that does not hurt or throb it is just there and the more intense it gets the more likely i am going to end up messing whatever i am currently doing up
but i just sit around all day and get in my head i do not want to hurt my friends and family
i have been doing this for years and i want to stop i never really cared before with others because they did not ever mean much to me but he does
the problem is i am not overweight or underweight so nobody sees a problem i did not understand why he would begin drinking again behind my back
today marks the 1 year anniversary of our break up my life just does not feel the same its been two weeks and it gets worse
3 i think he is the type of person who has an easier time moving on from people because he never actually makes the connection in the beginning it is as if he only keeps me around so the he is not the one that is lonely but one he has someone new who wants to be apart of his life then it is easy for him to just up and leave
i thought that i moved on but in this week i have started remembering again about my ex and her family when i sleep i remember her and her family so my anxiety starts and i wake up i can not sleep well
i am not talking about someone that is super leftwing or right wing etc i am talking someone that is just so irrational
i push people more and more away as they get closer or if they can not be pushed off i close myself
i do not really know what i want to achieve by doing this maybe some advice or somethingi do not even know where to begin
i have never been in a relationship and this is my half attempt to change my loneliness idk what else to say i am 22 m california usa
i did not get to see my friends as she did not want me around people who were not good or did not share my values
i know i broke your heart i miss youand i am sorry i really want us to start talking again i know it is been months of no contact butreally love you and still do
i was doing my opening clear and loud as much as possible and all of sudden one of the teacher told me to stop and skip my to the main part there are 4 parts she wanted me to go straight to the second part after my introduction i asked her to let me continue and she did
he said he needs time but i think that he is being nice and does not want to say i do not want to be in a relationship with you which is harsher but would of been so much better for me rather than dangling hope on a bit of string like a donkey with a carrot
i know the best think for me is to move on but it is not like it was a bad relationship it just ended because she could not handle the amount of heart break came along with being so far away from me as most of the relationship we lived together and were practically glued together
staying positive does not mean that things will turn out okay rather it is knowing that you will be okay no matter how things turn out
anyone in a similar boat i do not know if i am not ready or if he is not for me i do not care about dating tho i know i would have options if i wanted any i am not afraid of being alone i almost prefer it right now but i miss him and everything about him
and the things that people often lean on when faced with this dilemma are not present within me i have no passions nor things i want to do nothing interests me nowadays
there is always a way to find that happiness that is waiting for you but you first need to know where you are right now and accept that situation in order to find it
also can you suggest your therapist that you think you have a certain disorder and especially the last maybe is enough reason to me to do so
but i still look for you sometimes i call your name when i hear keys down the hall it feels like i am waiting for you to come home
did i lack somewhere i can not stop thinking about her so what other reasons for him to redownload the app so many time
eventually covid became better and i saw him and i was happy but two days later the covid caused his immune system to crash and it became shingles
i do not mind when she freaks out on me and she does often obviously she hurt her too because she did consider me a friend too and obviously still does
i tried to explain that it was not at all a reflection on his character but he is an extremely logical person and i do not think it really helped
now with nowhere to go stuck at home i am feeling claustrophobic i do not really like being outside that much and it is still 15 every day
i am equally terrified both of being turned down and being pity fucked because of the scarsjust thinking about being nakedvulnerable in front of somebody and having to fumble through explaining myself makes me want to cry
the second time probably 34 months after the first incident i started talking to this second girl she was in a relationship with someone whom she did not even know well
if you really think about it loneliness is like trying to get away from a super addictive drug it is like going through rehab you feel so much pain and struggle and you get sick mentally but at the end of it all you accept your loneliness and begin to look at the bright sides and start loving it
we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can but we can not read everything so community reports are essential
i started no contact i did not talk to her at all and it really helped and i was just going to be free of my feeling for her but she suddenly texted and said she wants us to be friends back and i am a people pleaser so i said yes
i just can not live with the thought of never seeing him again so i just hope we will cross paths some time
i have tried five different therapist who helped slightly but with my lack of income i have just enough money to feed myself and receive no money from the government
i called one back after a couple weeks and they said they could not help me right now unless i had just been released from an inpatient facility yknow with covid and all
suck it up i have always been contemplating suicide for years due to extreme loneliness now it is just a matter of time
this guys stays at almost 12 am waiting to hang out with her to catch things up i then went in my room and started to cry for about 30 minutes i just sat there crying
in a weird way while i think i know what i want i am sometimes driven crazy wondering whether that voice is mine or that of my mother
and that is only one story i could go on for pages about girls leaving me or straight making fun of me because of something i had no say in
its been a very rough few months but now i am beginning to see the light again life is only somewhat tolerable when i am stoned as fuck all of the time which is expensive
you are paying for the divorce since you wanted it and as far as the infidelity i will hire an attorney that will get everything thanks for your quick attention to this matter
tldr had a conversation with my friend whom i felt like i oneupped unintentionally and i feel extremely guilty for doing so
he said well you can not just keep showing up living without love is not really living days goes by and they all look the same no flavor
anyway as i was contemplating my loneliness on my sunset walk to the park and back i kept rehashing an old concept that i have convinced myself to hold onto feelings of loneliness are just a phase caused by poor habits within the realms of diet exercise and sleep patterns
she responded and told me that she and my ex were together for over a year i am not even kidding maybe i attracted people who did not have friends i do not know
and being myself is just awful aswell i am always depressed sad or just tired i am a very shy person i do not talk to girls nor have many friends which i hate i hate almost everything about me like my looks emotions
i have to live with family because i am not strong i do not have thick skin for all of this
i stopped dating and courting because it became nothing but me getting used and strung along while some other dude was in the picture that was not doing any of the stuff i was doing got all of her attention
i do not remember very much things of my childhood and that is another thing that hurts me but i remember the days i had traumas
a 47 day fling has come to an end i am 30 and he is 25it is christmas eve here and i am hours away from committing suicide
you can not see ptsd the way you can see a broken leg people do not just get why i am hurting all the time
i became a little distant and showed great interest in philosophy this absolutely destroys me since i loved this girl more than anything or anyone i had ever loved before
last time we met when she was bringing me some stuff i left in the apartment we hugged and it felt like the world was going down
but it hurts when these people tell me to just be myself or just vibe and then make me understand they prefer not having me around because i can be too much
my partner of 5 years does not deeply love me and has tried to split although we get along so well and he knows that
i am in denial and i can not move on do you guys think he will ever talk to me again what should i do
i believe a lot of us here have came across a mental health channel or two that we like perhaps it helped teach you about someone elses struggles so you did not feel so alone
all i wanted was an ocd diagnosis i did not want to look back into my traumatic childhood again again i do not know what to do
for a long time i was not able to share my feelings without feeling guilty but today i had alot of revelations i am more grounded then i have ever been this will not last forever so i wanted to make this post commemorating this moment as a remind that i can feel my own emotions i wish everyone reading this a happy christmas evechristmas day do not give up hope even if it feels like your life is meaningless there will always be someone who does care and will do anything to help you always encourage them to reach out for help too you both can help each other anyway have a good day everyone d
well i think some of you have the same problem as me after the breakup we do not have anyone to talk about what happened with you you can not share anything your thoughts nothing
i am just done but thanks reddit your beautiful hearts definitely made 2020 more endurable our politicians are playing nonsense games when the talked of 2k stimulus would literally mean i get to continue on to fight for the vulnerable another dayweekyear my biggest regret will be not seeing a woman of color sworn in as vp
but he just said he got into another relationship we met in october 2019 i just want to be happy man
i have always wanted to know what it felt like to be in a family i feel rejected from both my dads and my moms side
i do not think she just wanted to let me down easy i trust that she was being honest from her past behaviors and that she really does want to get back together soon so everything looks fine
fast forward to university after a long time i found a friend it was like an extrovert adopted me but after sometime she started avoiding me i accept that i had feelings for her but there is no way that she knew about them because i told no one
however instagram has not been easy i will admit insta was my go to when i was bored just the idea of me being together with another woman seems so
how much longer until i can consider this a permanent problem that deserves a permanent solution or do i just live the rest of my life miserable just to end up dying somewhere with the knowledge i could have saved everyone a whole bunch of time and effort seeing everything turned out that way anyways
what people do not realize when they meet others is that you do not know their story and trust me everyone has a story
unemployment is getting to me i have tried applying in various places with no success i do not really know what more to do
i carefully choose my words to convey my intent as best as i can i carefully try to tone my sentences with emojis to not come across confrontational i do my best but i am always taken the wrong way i am sorry to those i have hurt and made uncomfortable you will not have to worry about me reaching out ever again
obviously this is a problem and my doctor requested some blood work so i faced 2 of my fears and went into the hospital
i already tried to reach out to my mother about this i assume that it was not easy for her but she never got me a therapist while she had one for my brother i have always been the quiet one the one that does not really cry or get angry about anything the numb one
i realise i am very fortunate to be able to spend christmas with my family however i feel this way every single year when it gets to christmas time for some reason i have never been able to figure out why
i have no resources left and i have no will or energy left to generate any to get out from the pit we are in right now
i have not had any contact with him ever since except a long ass message from me a week later basically saying goodbye
i knew he would only get more mad if i told him the truth so i said i am stressed because of some deadlines and everything is just hitting me all at once
i always carry this feeling of being lonely cast away living a life which is not mine i fell in love with my best friend since we were so close we mistakenly rushed our relationship
it just does not seem worth it man i just do not see a solutionhave any of you had any bad therapists or was judged
tldr right now i feel numb to everything i have no interest in anything despite feeling positive emotionally and over the immediate grief of the loss i feel good in myself and have acknowledged that we might never get back together again but i feel numb to everything rn
most people would shy away run and never look back i did not most people would tell him to go seek a therapist or to try loving himself
i left my bf last year it was a really hard decision we recently started talking casually and it took a turn to a point where i felt like he was pressuring me to move faster
i am almost about to graduate high school and i am so numb to thoughts of relationships i know she is been a little depressed lately but i thought we were working on it together
how can they still look at me and say i love you son how can they do that how can they despite all the evil things i have how much love to they have they pulled me out the depths of hell they have given me everything and i spit in their face
before i would cope with gaming and escaping but that is not engaging to me anymore i would go out to have dinner at my favourite restaurant alone but enjoyable but we are in lockdown
my mental health is not the best anyways but this is a reoccurring theme with special holidays for the last couple of years
if some people treat me like shit and act like robots that does not makes me subnormal nor makes them normal that makes us different
but i willingly lie to myself and try to hurt people i am actually envious ofi have been like this for a long time even tho i am still young
it is taking over my life and my parents believe everything can be cured by following the path of god or whatever and do not take my mental health seriously and i can not afford therapy myself please provide any helpful opinions
multiple times she is told me that she feels like today would be her last day those days i have somehow talked her out of it
i have suffered for days before that but when i heard her say that i just feltnumbi was not happy obviously but not sad either
human society just does not seem to want me i feel like they constantly tell me how interesting i am and how they would love to have me as a friend but at the end of the day choose other people at the end of the day my entire life has been weekends spent at home in my room on my computer why is it if i am so interesting that i am always alone
i was harassed by an employee and stocked by a guy wanting to date me i suffered nightmares and dreams my entire life leaving me more tired than when i went to sleep
why is he treating me better than you did when we dated for two years you and i had been a part of each others worst moments
i do not even remember the last time i thought of myself as an individual and not just a blurred creature i can not even recognize
these past two years she has kept all our photos and videos and has always made an effort to check up on me from time to time and care for me but i was still very hurt from what she did until i found it within myself to forgive her for what she did but i still could not talk to her because i just thought my time with her was good for what it was and nothing else
i told her i do not want to be dependant on drugs but she is insisting on taking for at least 3 more weeks
by the time september rolled around we were doing fine until i went back to work at my two jobs but he remained unemployed because the bar he worked at permanently closed
she was a little secretive about some of her personal details but not overly so i myself am not in this sub
i do talk superficially with my classmates but i do it less than what is normal i believe that they think i am autistic or something weird
it does not help that my roommates are gone for thanksgiving and obviously so i can quarantine so i am alone in my apartment for basically the first time since we ended
just like how santa claus is not real it gets better is not real either and i am tired of waiting i have been plotting my suicide for 9 months and i have been wanting to die before that as well it is time for me to die
i really wish things would have worked out between us for the better and wish she would have fought for us but for who i guess family abroad and charities
the reason for this is that she keep our relationship secret from their family so i could not go stay over in her house and i do not have the resources to just travel to another country whenever i want specially a country that has animosity towards mine and were stuff can get dangerous in the frontier chileneans and argentinians have a history of xenophobia with one another and this warning came from a chilenean woman with family there
that said here are some i feel are the easiest to use and most helpful i am a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that is not your preference i also find the calm app helpful but did not include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit
then i realized his following count was going up so i noticed he was on so passive aggressively i messaged him asking him if he was back
my ex and i were in a long distance relationship he cheated on me multiple times and the first time we broke up was 7 months ago of course there were other problems more than the cheating break ups are always complicated they are not always just black or white you know
i tried killing myself by buying a rope to hang myself and taking multiple sleeping pills i wrote a good bye letter to my family but i woke up
i can not be friends with her i have not talked to her since the breakup but she said she still wanted me to be her friend
it is just so hard to do especially after what we had and how close we were i just feel horribly depressed for no reason now
i do not care if i flunk out of school or if everything in my life goes wrong because i simply do not want to live
she said she does not think she will be happy in the city which i tried to re assure her we would not be living in the city
she also was still seeing him but did not want to break up with me until after christmas so i forced myself to forget i was in denial for a very long time
i want a nice organized life and stuff but ended up moving in with my bf and his mom into their apartment
i hope that can help i feel so sad for you we were friends and i was sad we always told each other always and forever
i want to have revenge on all my college batchmates but i do not know how i am not posting this because i want sympathy
if you are living with someone is experiencing symptoms of mental illness do not make them feel bad for still showing signs of sadness and suffering
i planned to die this week but since i just started my job they are holding my first paycheck for another week
it is hard to explain it makes me just want to lie down i yawn i feel irritable it is like all motivation evaporates
i never felt happy it always felt like a mask and i could not get it off i remember crying in the bathroom at school for 3 classes
but it makes people feel bad why does it because people pain maybe i am really just manipulative and i am too defective to even be aware of it all the more reason me ending it should be a source of joy for others i wish people would just admit it instead of trying to make themselves feel better
i have been feeling down and bad about myself for the last 2 years atleast it is getting worse i keep having syicidal thoughts i do not know what to do with those emotions i have like these rage episodes or depressive episodes and i am scared i do not know what is happening to me i tried to talk to my parents about it but they said it is my fault and it is all because of those damn videogames and my friends and of course because of the fact that i am a teenager
my guess is that i am so anxious and do not want to miss anything in life that my body just can not nap even though i desperately need the extra sleep like if the house caught on fire i would rather be sleepy and wake to see and experience it than taking a nap and caught off guard lol
i like my religion and i do not plan on leaving it because i know my obsessive thoughts are wrong but i just can not stop it
i am a sadantisocialoverthinkerinsecureworryingmadhateful jealous and tiredsleepy sack of shit funny thing is i am only a freshman in high school i finally threw away every last little thing i had i wake up feeling more alive
yes at the end of the day she still saw me as a close friend but i was not going to let that stop me from trying
he does this one thing with texts all the time where he sends one of the same 1012 pictures of mesister when we were 1013 to me or my sister before she blocked him and just recently started a group chat with his whole side of the family and me and just said memories
i do not know what those last three and a half years meant to you obviously they did not mean as much to as they did to me
the longing for a constant touch has outweighed the patiently waiting period till i saw him again she hit me like she wanted to kill me
now she is currently threatening to kill her self bc i make her want to bc i would not condemn violence i did but this is not violence
i am someone who thinks that the world is only awful and that by the end of the day there is nothing in it worth saving that it is doomed to be like this and that is the truth
its not like i do not know how to approach girls but the ones i am interested in and approach are always taken or simply not interested in me and the ones who approach me are just there for casual dating bullshit
i am afraid it will never get better i wanted to take my life yesterday but my girlfriend convinced me to stay
thanks for reading and have a great holiday season despite these unfortunate timesi have been dealing with panic attacks anxiety and headaches for the past threefour months
anyways he literally does not like me at all does not want to be with me uses me for sex talks to other girls in front of me and i let it happen i do not yell about it anymore i do not try to talk about it anymore and yet i am still so sad and heartbroken just wishing he would change his mind
i will more at peace with being lonely than being surrounded by people it is hope that one day i could be happy that makes this harder
example 1 i took a ferry trip with my parents today and the whole time i kept thinking that someone was going to pull out a gun and hold us all hostage
she has anxiety problems and i am aware of them but i thought she could still maybe compromise in the end i said fine you can have tinder
it is been years since i took an ssri but this numbing aspect of it has lasted a long timerewind 2 years ago i had my first relationship
i would laid out a future with her and now it is overhow do you tell someone who you love that you are going to kill yourself soon
and thanks to them i was able to help many people in need especially many children to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year i honestly did not think i would make it to the end of the year
i am 15 years old and living with my parents so its hard to hide the fact i am drinking and i know i need to stop but i just can not as it feels so damn good i could really use some help right now
made a diary for myself and started writing in it everyday actively distract myself if i feel upset stopped talking to everyone except my family and it feels so peaceful
i tried overdosing but it is too painful i hate the cramps and shivers i get after i throw up and when i do recover i get slower
one time he told me about a girl he used to hook up with who met up with him and wanted to get into a relationship with him
my father is 66 years old and has been someone has dealt with ocd his entire life he comes from a time and place where mental health was never discussed and always taboo he has spent his life establishing fixed beliefs and finding any sort of information that supports his belief even if it is not really evidence
if it is something bad for someone with a logical reasoning why do they still not understand i remember waiting outside covid isolation ward not knowing what was happening
fuck this life i just sent a message to my first ex to ask about the kids and told me to do 1 as i am not wanted around anymore and that i mean nothing to them at all how cruel can people be even when your related i do not get it anymore my life is upside down all i asked was if they are okay and get treated like that and then block me like i am nothing guess i am nothing anyway
the last person who touched me was a nurse taking my blood for a lab test and that does not seem like it will change anytime soon rip me
i spent countless hours every weekend on my only off days writing cards for his clients until my hands were sore and going over phone scripts with him
for fuck sake this was years ago and i still cry about itdo you know how fucking traumatizing is to change in a boys lockers room
i show up at his house as he and mom are leaving to get his car i did lie to his mom about not knowing where he was and i apologized to her for that again my own insecurities
she completely broke down confessed everything she was in that abusive relationship but did not have the courage to fully break away
my mood attitude friendships feelings relationships family connections have been a massive roller coaster this whole year i can get through the day but that is it school dropped out
what harm could it do they have been friends for a year and i should get to know one of her close friends
it is strange how life can be so terrible even when you do not have something really terrible happening to you but only because you are lost in emptiness and loneliness i feel this is not my real life my real life is in some alternate universe where i made some different choices and now i am having a decent career and i have friends and a life as everyone else
my moms never directly blamed shit on me with that but some things she says i know are correlated with me basically being the because for our disfunctional house and the reason they are still together and so hateful
it is ok if she says it was troublesome for her but for me it was the only time in my life when i was happy i do not think i will ever be that happy now again or ever
one of the strangest things i have noticed is that my friends are bad weather friends if i am feeling depressed or something in my life has gone wrong they will always be there for me they are supportive and understanding if i am having a problem but the minute something good happens in my life they disappear
every time i see anything even remotely pertaining to the pandemic it sends me into a downward spiral of resentment and bitterness
i do not know if calling my work ethic procrastination is correct i can not it is so hard it makes me so depressed i feel like i can not do anything
heck i always used to wish everyone on their birthday toobut hardly anyone did for mine it just crossed my limits
i also start bragging a bit and not being completely honest telling her my weight went up from 55 to 75 instead of 52 to 70
i was happy for him but i told him that i would rather him not talk abt her because i was getting over him
later if i am going to kill myself they going to say why thati did not give signals i gave a lot but they ignore
secondly should i share how my therapy is going with other people in my lifei am not sure if i should do this or what i only have 2 people i would really want to share my details with one being my girlfriend and the other being my best friend
her dad was manipulative and she was never sure if his love came with ulterior motives her older brother used her on multiple occasions to get what he wanted at great expense to her
she knows what she is getting at and i am pretty sure she always had liked him back too i mean it does explain why they are together i guess
why do you think so many people use it as a weaponi have have plenty of conversations with people who call me quiet
i came out of the surgery fine and had a difficult rehabilitation to heal my back and use a tracheotomy that connects to a ventilator to breathe at night
i had a spouse but they told me i was too much to handle mentally so they left me i lost the one thing that was keeping me going
then he said you know it is not a problem at all do what you have to do to recover from all this and do not hesitate to text me if you need anything alright
i am hoping maybe those that read this can leave some supportive words not just for me but for any others alone this holiday season
i have ended up in psych wards more than i can remember because of him because of the struggles i go through on a daily basis
i asked her to do anything with me but she only could complain more i asked you to work on the garden with me i mean no offense to people who enjoy gardening but how the hell am i supposed to get any satisfaction out of gardening i am not some green thumbed rocking chair sitting old grounds keeper who enjoys watching a fucking tomato grow just to pick it off in the end to sell it or eat it do it for a living go ahead
it is that pain that is keeping me awake at night and i do not know what to do about it except doing something else than trying to sleep for about 40 minutes then try again
i saw that these episodes repeating in my stage of my life when i was adolescent i did not have any friend who i could share with it
people are fucking fake as fucking hell and i want to just hurt myself now the anger will just be gone as soon as i hurt myself to the point where i die
i am tired of everyone telling me you will meet the one and life is so much fun why are you so negative
so about 6 months ago my friends sat down with me and told me i was being a jerk selfish socially unaware and snippy and that i needed to change i tried to do so but i apparently i did not change i actually became worse
i have never met a real person who is interested in anything i truly have to say everyone is always just too busy to even try
but when i found out in june that you already found someone else which resulted in silence between the two of us it was not just a punch but a whole canon in my face
i look at her with other people everybodys kind to her loves and appreciates hershe looks so innocent and cheerful not a trace of malice
on days i need to be up early the next day this could also onset a seizure as a result i highlight this as a large problem i have not slept on my front for years i attempt to avoid sleeping on the side but sometimes unachievable however this can lead to a very painful following day starting as early as when i wake up
we respected each other to the utmost and i was everything to her i was doing okay until about february of 2020
for a depressedaddiction person there is typically a lack of the ego it is a bipolar effect as the id does things the superego disagrees with and reprimands the id for it is actions while the superego thinks about things the id disagrees with causing a constant flux within a person
every time i move on you tell me how you still want to get together and i believe you because i am so sure we changed you even became my friend
i want to make it more bearable for him any ideas i am always on a quest to prove to myself that he loves me more
i have already drawn the layout of my school and drew a plan of where i am going to kill in order
it is probably convenient when you have depersonalization i kind of agree with but it is not a mental illness and i do not believe in god
i have had depression since i was 14 i have had periods of suicidal ideation with a plan since then i have been in therapy on meds i exercise i am employed yet i still feel like none of this is worth it i will likely end my life in the next couple of weeks how are people so hopeful about life what is the secret
i encourage her she makes the transition and its goes well for her she finally makes some good friends because i am not shit just does not feel the same anymore
i could tell something was wrong but he kept promising everything was good and at one point said i was acting crazy for calling him out on it
i did not even look behind me when crossing the road to see if a car was coming or not and did not care one bit about being hit
a lot of things have happened in the past a lot of fights where she ended up hurting herself cutting her hand and punching on the wall out of anger and it is one of the main reasons that her father does not want me to be with her
he argued about how he has not told his best friend anything about the breakup and how he respects me enough to not talk about me to anyone
how do you be alone and not lonely i am not always actively aware of this but whenever i am by myself all of these feelings crash down around me
one might say let the ego off and start approaching people urself but that too goes in vain i do not remember the last time i approached someone and they were interested
i have felt like this for quite some time now i am tiredright now i do not have anyone who likes me or wants me in their friend circle
and that was okay better than nothing but actually being close to anybody no it had nothing to do with it
this made me develop severe anxiety and i did not have many friends mainly just a few acquaintances i have also never had anything remotely close to a relationship to this day
he would rather spend hours and hours putting so much effort into his computer playing video games then he ever has me
me20f and my boyfriend22m have been dating for almost a year however we have been constantly arguing about his female friends who makes me feel really uncomfortable all the time
i am sorry to post something so debbiedowner on christmas eve but tonight started with a christmas with family masks 6feet and everything
it always starts with a feeling of uneaseunsafe then i get a headache and light hurts then i get nauseous then i start have depersonalizationdr and feel as though i am not real or my environment is off or wrong
sometimes i sit and think to myself what is the point and i can never provide myself with an answer i can search through the internet and through my books and through my own thoughts but there is never a solid answer what is the point of life what is the point of suffering
he is according to films like the notebook and love actually the perfect partner attentive caring would go to the ends of the earth for me
worthy of note the only drugs i have done are acid about 4 times shrooms 4 times and smoked weed regularly and drank very seldom
i am not depressed i am not really sad nothing really bad has happened in my life i do not even know if i want to kill myself or not for some reason i want to want bad things to happen to me or for myself to be depressed or suicidal and i do not know why
2020 has been pretty hard on so many and with a covidwinter almost upon us i feel like the seasons might be a little more difficult this year i know there are some people out there maybe on this sub that are spending the holidays either alone or depressed
raid shadow legends is one of the biggest mobile roleplaying games of 2020 and it is totally free currently almost 10 million users have joined raid over the last six months the highly anticipated new faction wars feature is now live you might even find my squad
i am sorry i am feeling very distraught right nowthrowra sorry for bad grammar not a native english speaker first time posting on reddit also posted on rrelationship_advice
i think that with a few exceptions the experience of watching yourself die without being able to do anything about it is just about the worst thing anyone can experience and i can not put myself through that again
being in lockdown for almost a year with parents that do not show affection and only consistently talk to me about my career path takes a heavy toll on my mental health
hi 30m i am a month and half into my breakup that lasted 4 years it hurts can not stop thinking about her every way
i stopped caring about celebrating i stopped caring about spending time with family and i even stopped caring about things that actually benefit me like presentsgifts
a groupchat i am in they are all super supportive and nice best people online that i knowmy mood attitude friendships feelings relationships family connections have been a massive roller coaster this whole year
i see him trying to reconnect with friends texting all day long trying to hold on i do it too but during quarantine the feeling to be alone is so big
i feel like she has stabbed me in the back and hurt me even more than she ever planned to by waiting until the week of our anniversary to end the relationship and only minutes after giving me a gift at that
my first real relationship i was 1516 and were together for 7 months short right i have worked two slave jobs and it nearly killed me i need to complete an education fully
i wish i did not exist because i do not have the energy to face these things all of these internal things hurt me to my core and i have no release
but on the other hand a lot of these same people from these groups also do not get along with each other very well
your life is worth living and i do not want to wake up and find out you killed yourself because you have so many great things to do in life
i am a senior in college and i live in an offcampus apartment my roommate decided to move back home so i am living alone until my lease ends in may while i love my alone time not seeing another human being for possibly weeks is a weird feeling
i usually am considered the emotional support friend and i am totally fine with that but after the toxic gf thing i am really worried if i am actually helping or if i am just making things worse
i am sick of not being allowed to sleep i am sick of my wife feeling guilty for everything but being unable to change any of it
this is the way out of light depression and light addiction i think being in quarantine makes it harder as well because i am forced to face these lonely thoughts
i scratch my neck a lot and leave it bruised i always look depressed but i do not fucking know because i can not take therapy
i would really like some help on how you have moved on from relationships you all thought would never get over from
it just fucks with me i have tried i have been acquainted with several dudes over the years i have waited for them to ask to hang out i have asked them to hang out watch a ufc ppv or grab a drink or what ever

so the reason i give much attention to my ocd story promises is because i do not know if gods accepted the promise someone has a fear of germs he washes his hands he can persuade himself to stop worrying by not washing his hands he sees that he is ok and maybe worries less he has witnessed that his ocd is wrong
i guess what i am saying is now that i experienced that relationship i know what it feels like to truly love someone and i do not feel it w the new guy at all
i helped him with his emotions work chores for a month i have never really been the type to have lots of friends anyways probably why i am depressed as heck lol
anyone else still having these feelings over a year post break up and finally find solace i thought a year would be long enough to get over a 2 year relationship with a person i never see and have not spoken to for about 6 months
i am not one who likes random chit chat i prefer to talk about deep subjects and it seems that it scares peoples
i wanted to get in touch with one or multiple person have them answer some question then told me about their lifeetc
hello i am not going to say my name where i am from or how old i amthough i believe you can calculate it but i will tell you my story
he tells his few friends that i am crazy and i am sure it seems like it from what he tells them but they do not know the full story that him lying to me and gaslighting me and paying for sex having sex wo condoms with anyone condoms are a must for me plus all the other things i found out would make any woman crazy
but i was not doing him any favors i had been enabling him for so long i broke it off later that night
met a new guy honestly i am not fully over the breakup that happened 3 months ago i still secretly wish we were together so i knew this would not be a serious thing
if i am ever contacted it is because i can provide something useful to my friends like a house to have a party or a friend to be the driver
then one day his ex showed up on his door step she brought him food from time to time and found out she was trying to rekindle things
i can not draw or write anymore either for lack of inspiration or for lack of energy and when i do it lasts a day and is therefore even more disappointing and frustrating when it is gone so fast
we became okay after these breakups and we hangout with her friends i tried introducing her to my friends but she is distant towards them
i have been extremely lonely this semester but it has really intensified the last couple weeks as my coworkers have stopped doing anything with me you know busy classes lots of work etc
i know i needed to break up with him but he is so hurt maybe i should have just kept with it so he would not hurt i do not know
thoughts and all kinds of distraction will bubble up in your mind at some point let them do not judge them and do not beat yourself up for not concentrating enough let it go the process here is very similar to the letting go one that we mentioned before
have been to every kind of therapy psychiatry imaginablemoved into a tiny apartment so my family did not have to deal with my mental illness
first of all i am feeling super uncomfortable with the whole situation a because i do not know who is telling him that or if this is some big charade and b the way he is talking just makes me super uneasy
i have started to accidently dissociate sometimes i think and i cry really easily happy things make me sad and stuff like that
he even told me that his best friend and mom did not like her i met his friends his boss his best friends
after a year and half or so my depression was completely gone last remaining thing to overcome was a cannabis addiction
if they had actually raised me i would have a chance at a real life i am not killing myself they have already done that for me in every instance of neglect
he bounced around from a lot of family members growing up and was never really offered or given help with trauma abuse and other things he should have definitely gotten help for
what do you really expect of me to turn work into a party to turn the classroom into a party see this is why this is an excuse
if you would like to help me you can dm me i would be happy to hear you psi did not mean to upset or to be rude to anyone if you felt like it i am sorry
if you only knew what i go through without you by my sideif you only knew your all i ever think about
for the lies that happened during the relationship for the fact that since we parted i have not written not once because selfishness is dearer to him
i do not have anybody to spend christmas and new year with i live alone and the only friends i have are either 3000 kms away and a girl that friendzoned me
thank you for taking your time to read this post and thank you to those who have participated already but i need another 1000 participants
i am 65 and i used to weigh 295lbs i now weigh 215 i tried so hard to be there for you to support you when your depression came around
i always remind myself that it was not her fault it is just her actions due to addiction and i am always reminded that i should not feel this way towards her because she is my mother
so i will text girls and facetime them for a month or two i am really into these girls i am an athlete so i do not really have time but i try to make plans to hangout with these girls and maybe date them they always flake me and ghost me not long after anyone have a clue why
you can say that i might have been either goddamn unlucky or that i am a misfit i often feel like i do not belong in this world and i hate everyone when such thoughts appear
and i see like people at the street see that too and my power so hard what the just feeling it they trying to foun d wtf is going on here i saying hey i am here and they all found me and starting to look at my window
but wishing does not change cold hard realitywith you i truly love him i have not had another real relationship just talking to people
because we can now sleep well and does not have to fear that they might burn themselves has happened ore something else
but what irritates me the most is that i do not really now if i even want a partneryou lost your love and now you miss your dreamin
she tried to distance herself from me multiple times and when i patch things up she lies to me again and i could not not believe her because it would have meant that i would end up alone again
i normally have 34 of these episodes a day when i get them my father and mother shaped up for her and my sisters entire life she is been their angel
the next day she called me and said i was acting weird hers is centered around food when she is hungry nothing sounds good so that makes her angry
my mum constantly yells at me for anything from having attitude to being rude to even using the bathroom and no i am not exaggerating that last one
many of us are lonely the world is unfair i get it how can i make sure that the world will not turn me into angry person who tries to manipulate others to compensate for the love i did not get throughout my life
i am going to wait to do it until mid january so that i do not have to ruin the holidays for my family i do not think they would even care but i have caused enough suffering for everyone it would be rude of me to ruin the holidays for them
but i remember the days i had traumas it will just make you stronger they say i do not want to be any stronger i am so tired
when i am gone my parents will have a much better situation financialy i know it will hurt them but i am looking at the bigger picture and they are the only two people this will actually affect there is nobody else
yes we loved each other yes we had a great relationship and barely fought but there were also things and moments i tolerated when honestly i really fucking should not have
all i think of when i see the nhs is a cabal of middle aged white people deciding how happy i will get to be none of them thinking for a single fucking moment they do not know what is best for me
but i am not a child anymore and i am not stupid enough to believe that is how this is going to end for me people do not just pop out of thin air to save you and make you feel better and even if someone did i know myself well enough to say that i would just tell them to piss off hell i did just a couple of months ago
i do believe after a lot of research that he is narcissistic and obviously i was codependent and have my own issues if i iet someone treat me that way for so long and still want to be with them
so i am definitely a better concept than a reality when it comes to dating women who have looked past my looks and been attracted to my personality have usually felt let down when they are either sitting opposite me and have to face the physical reality or in bed or even in conversation online it is easier since i can take the time to think and i am a good writer but that does not work in real life
instead of dating since we basically did that for 11 months already we continued doing what we normally did only we moved in together as well our time together was great we laughed had fun explore the city watch movies got along great in the apartment smooth sailing
anyways let me break it down i have crazy attachment issues and mommy issues which of course have a effect on all of my relationships
i broke up with him three months ago because he was sexting other chicks during longdistance lying to me about it
i happen to be born this way without anyone in my family having the same disease as i do i often wish i could be normal or at least not have to go to the hospital a lot
for those who do not know nocontact is a wellknown technique that helps you move on from your ex as the name implies it means you cut off all contact with your ex you do not call her you do not message her you do not like their posts you do not even wish them a happy birthday
now that it has been a month i can think in retrospective and conclude that this was never about us it was always about something else about your parents since we started 2 years ago that journey together i always had to be a perfect women but myself always to meet your parents requirements
i still am madly in love with me ex and i understand that i crossed a boundary of hers broke her trust and that ultimately i did this to myself but at the same time i feel like our relationship could have been repairable if we both just sat down and had an honest dialogue about how and why it happened
basically i gave him more than i could receive from him he soon left and i went back to celebrate christmas and i was fine
it is been about 10 days since she started seeing someone and i do not know how long it is going to take to get back to my normal self
i would never actually kill myself maybe i do not belong here then but i do not know where else to go because i am certainly contemplating why i have to exist
we have covered this topic in our recent youtube video because we believe everyone deserves to be happy and to know the real meaning of happiness
i have had a weird year everyone has it is a thingit is been a shitty year a shitty life i am just utterly alone
i still do not know how to live my life without him but i guess time is the only thing that will tell
if anybody has been in the same situation i would love to hear how you overcame this shit to actually be happy for once
i used to listen to music and the lyrics would talk about being numb i never really understood it i guess until now
but am i the bad guy that is what i have not processed yet because everyone i speak to says no she was wrong for handling it like this that i am not toxic but she was always right about everything so no matter how hard i try i can not convince myself that she was wrong
after some months three months before we move to england he snapped at me and deleted whatsapp and said that he is wasting his time with me and to not try to contact him
i am with my friends we are hanging out and talkingsuddenly all of their phones started ringing like someone find a cure to the plague or something
the start of my struggles with anxiety and depression is also where my relationship with my mother began to deteriorate
my brother thought he could rely on family to do something else if he could not succeed in his exams he is now blaming our family for ruining his life his confidence
after repeated requests for how i needed deserved to be spoken to nothing changed despite them having started counselling there was also a lot of gaslighting and other emotional manipulation going on
i am just going to convince myself to not feel the entire time i am there it is okay i can still fake it til i make it and maybe one day i will not need to fake it anymore
i am so lonely god damn and i have zero motivation and i can barely brush my fucking teeth or even take a shower
watching christy mack talk about what she went through on the stand and reading about it honestly broke me emotionally completely
i just find it crazy how people tell you to think about your family and friends when you want to commit because they will suffer when completely ignoring the fact that the person is suffering in real time
sorry if this was harsh but i hope i helped someonealso here is my youtube so you can subscribe when i post my first video
idk if anyone wants to talki have been attending my first year of university online and i have had so much trouble making friends
has anyone ever been in a similar situation that could offer me advice even my kids that is what hurts a lot
i once told you holding you in my arms that if we were apart i will feel free and at peace for the first couple of weeks and then be sad i was wrong
i am a christian that i need her and cannot live without her for a single smallest particle of a planck time and they all know it perfectly on each and every spare moment i can only possibly have
there is not a single person in my life that i could call right now not a single person i could ask for help if i needed it if i needed a place to lay my head a meal a drive a hug a chit chat not a single person
you have been running from everything work responsibilities society just end it all is not this what you have always wanted it is going to be that simple
objectively i have it pretty good but that does not change the fact that i am not happy with myself i feel like i should be able to handle my shit but i just can not anymore
i just can not believe itso i am having some very heavy suicidal thoughts and i am thinking about ending it all probably tomorrow
now open up some presents spread some joy sing some christmas songs and give some gifts to those who are close to you
we had some small arguments about stupid stuff and the last argument made her decide to leave it was something stupid over the dishwasher
i know it will not be easy but ultimatley i am so dedicated to you and making this work with you and i know you feel the same so there is nothing stopping us
why can not they see that i do wear long sleeves a lot but at school mainly nobody cares at my moms house so why do i have to hide them if they do not care
my context i have a job that i held for two years not even a parttime job as i only work two hours daily
we lived together after knowing each other for a year and a half and dating for 3 months yes young love and young mistakes
2 people from reddit told me that i am depressed but honestly i still do not think it is true she is very against all medication she does not even take ibuprofen
my mom then yells so you want to fight me what did i do to you do you know you could have hurt me my dad and brother rush in
i never intended to do this though he opened up to me about his ex and i opened up about my boyfriend
what i want to ask you guys is that should i contact her to let her know that i have forgiven her because before cutting contact with her she knew that i was upset with her and she did say she was sorry for that but i was not ready at all to accept her apology
i hope that you will enjoy this life more than i did and that next year will be better for you
i am so lost and have no idea what to do i do not think i am a bad person before lockdown i was not great at socialising i was okay but i have just lost so much confidence i do not know how to fix it
it is a pity that a few of these experts actually try to use solid relational skills like present moment awareness empathy and setting boundaries to help you reattract your ex
i did everything i could to experience life with you and you helped me grow as a person and as a lover and a boyfriend
i am sick of just consuming bullshit and being unable to react to it because of my stupidity i will most probably end it tomorrow
for me it is waking up late at 12pm sometimes not eating on time use my phone for 9 hours if not play a video game or video games for 9 hours for the day eat food maybe shower poop and piss sleep late procrastinate homework this is for the holiday break or if there is no school
i am not feeling anything of that sort at the moment but this single thought can make me cry my eyes out
i can not wait to meet my new mates in the army ill enjoy myself tonight pick myself up and tolerate this soul sucking job till the end of this month then i can ship off and make lifelong friendships w my future brothers and sisters in arms
i find myself feeling like crying eyes stinging the feeling of my chest tightening when something i planned does not work out the way i want like when i already know what i want to cook but my parents tell me that they already decided what they are going to prepare
i have never connected with someone like her it was not long at all but it just felt so god damn right
i have been thinking for about a month that everything would just be better if i was not here anymore i know it will hurt my family and friends a lot but i feel like i am past the point where that thought would stop me now
but that is the uncomfortable realization we have to face right we are alone ultimately we have to make due with what we have got
is this like a stage of breakup and has anyone else experienced similar things they keep saying they will call me back with a list but they never do
but i do not know what to say besides that i miss him and i love him that i want to come home
i get attached to easily especially when it comes to being intimate with someone we would play hide and seek i did not feel bad for her
at the moment the corona virus has a huge inpact on ours lifes many of us are in qurantee or are not aloud to go to work this gives us all more spare time even if we are working on a home office we can use this time to work on our social skills cominication skills we know the opportunity to invest time in ourselves in our lives and to overcome lonleness
however with more and more time passing by we obviously started learning new things about each other we share our feelings and talk about more serious things
we dated for a little over a year and broke up about two weeks ago it does not feel like that long ago
but this has started to genuinely make my life so difficult now and my mental health is struggling massively and yes i tried connecting to them myself but i usually get an excuse corona does not help either
when i showed up a boy i knew from school was there and he was known to manipulate girls and force himself upon people
so i went home 2 hrs away from where we lived to see my parents for a week and when i came back we tried to work on things
i was even used by other people for money and a lot of times make people fun of my to act as a friend and than leaving me and laugh at me because i thought i could finally have friends
i find it hard to tell people how i feel sometimes because i am scared the emotion will not last and i will switch to a polar opposite an hour after i tell them how i feel
start living in your bodymoving away from the judging analyzing and planning of your head take in the feeling of movement google walking meditation explore yogahttpswwwgoodtherapyorglearnabouttherapytypesyogatherapy
all that remains are these personas used to mask this void fuck i have had a good run at least i feel my existence is too painful to keep going
i am sorry if i sound enraged but i kind of am my world is on fire i just want it to stop
i do not feel capable enough to look for a job not even capable enough to be enough of a human to begin with even less to get into the work ambient as it is required
this generally goes for all my tech and it does not matter if i know it is nonsense i will still feel like they are going to break anyways
long story short we separated because of long distance the relationship was good we cared about each other and we still talk everyday
i wish i did not have to be a burden on them i wish i did not have to ruin their days with my sad ramblings i can not solve
it feels like i am breaking in two i just keep waiting and praying to any god that will listen for him to want me back
the last 3 months of quarantine have been tough on me and whatever tiny social life i had i kept myself going by listening to the voices on my online lessons and by sometimes asking some questions
he loved cute animals and cute things and would share videos of cats and adorable illustrations with me his messages to me when he was in love were all grammatically correct and read just like the man of my dreams would send he did not watch adult videos while in our relationship and therefore respected my boundary no disrespect to anyone out there who watches that it is just a preference thing he had the same political beliefs and spiritual beliefs overall liberal and not religious and i live in an area where that is rare he gave me gifts that i adored he did cute voices for my plushies yeah
i was diagnosed 7 years ago but every time i think about those times i get chills down my spine like it was just yesterday and today is just a dream
any advice i am sure it will help a lot thanksi just want some advice and feedback about talking to and texting girls
due to a lot of factors i have been home for about 6 months now and its really getting to me
am i crazy for believing this or is there maybe a chance would love to hear other experiences thanks and it is makes me reallly fucking crazy because i am a lucky one
i am recovering from fucked up surgery and the painkillers i was on made me feel so sick i just needed someone so bad
i absolutely love my best friend and would like them in my life for a long time the thought of losing them scares the shit out of me
i was sad i lost something that i felt pushed me to keep going but i knew i should not quit and i had options to keep pushing myself
for reference i was his first real relationship and we ended things mutually bc of busy schedulesbut i can not tell you anything bc it will just hurt you
as of recent i have been failing to stop thinking about her like i really miss her and it could just be because of the holidays but it is like i want her back or just want to disappear from her life permantly
i did not remember any of it until he mentioned it today i do not recall having a bad dream either and normally i remember my dreams
now he tells me he has fallen out of love with me and needs to end things i am absolutely heartbroken and shocked
i feel as if i was not ever even meant to be born and my suicidal thoughts only get worse every day
anyway the movie is about a guy who wants to kill himself and is sent a guardian angel to show him everything he has to live for
i do not want to tell my parents about what happened because they are conservative mexican parents and i do not want them to think any less of her
growing up i did not feel grief when i lost greatgrandparents or anyone that i did not know i only felt grief when i saw my grandparents cry which i only saw like once or twice i felt grief when i sawheard anyone cry even a stranger
when i finally confronted my mother and auntmy aunt claimed no such thing ever happened to me so the options are casual indifference or malicious stupidity the rage i had came back two fold
fourth not giving myself the respect and love that i give so freely to others without realising if you do not respect yourself nobody will
i have been single for almost 6 years and it has not been fun had my heart played and broken many times but being the type of person i am i do not know how to express the feelings i have so i bottle them and keep them to myself bad thing to do i know but i can not find anyone who i can trust enough to confide my feelings with
i used to love video games now every time i play one i feel empty i used to love model painting now every time i do it i feel empty
i did not make any good friends in college and i never had a girlfriend right now i do not have anyone who likes me or wants me in their friend circle
wbu then he says a lot better recently and then i ask if its because of her i have not talk with him for ages he said he is getting divorce
hello i never thought i will ever write something like this before especially somewhere on the internet but i feel just too much pressure and responsibility saying it to someone irl out loud
but he was still there for me ever day we grew up together and i thought no matter what we loved each other and he would get better for me
with all my live to all the fellow people in heartbreak misery we will be fine the only thing keeping me here is a fear of what is on the other side
i need help on understanding what is going on here he has me added on everything still and still kind of talks to me as if we are friends which we are decidedly not i can not handle being friends with him but he has not said anything to me privately or texted me does he want to be friends or is he being polite
we spoke about trying things again and even even shared secret i love you i really pictured being with her for the rest of my life
um yea i just feel like i am constantly being annoying and that i need to stop thinking i need to be independent all the time
for several weeks i just felt bad and then everything calmed down or so it seemed to me as now at that time i felt the need for love
when you can not relate to the quarantine loneliness posts because your life is the exact same people said i could do it professionally imagining a socially inept autistic writing savant
i am struggling because an overwhelming majority of the stuff i have read since my breakup has the perspective of the ex being an evil person who discarded the dumpee and does not care to reach out this evil ex blocks the person and does not contact the dumpee because they do not care enough and have forgotten about them
the only reason i am not ending it all is because i know if i do everyone in town is going to say this was bound to happen and it was not i really did try my best but nothing is ever changing what should i do
since late june i have been distancing myself from nearly everyone my xbox friends who i consider my virtual family my mom and real life friends and evenmy own girlfriend in some cases i have only become self aware of this just recently is there anything i can do to stop myself from distancing myself
update jwu feeling confused because i realized somehow i have been fine already lately and do not need to delete my socials necessarily
i am disabled and my mum is my carer as i have a lot of health problems that require medication that i am not allowed to have without supervision due to suicide attempts
he talked to me several times a day and even visited me i forgave him and got back together or when they break an agreement that we had regarding privacy
i spent the last few months alone at their home packing all their belongings to top it off i had nobody to help me and my insurance ended
they were very abusive and cheated and tried to get me jealous they were genuinely horriblebut then we changed classes now we are all in different courses in different colleges
my life is so boring i have never dated drank or done nothing i so badly want to move on and not to think about him but it does not help me
we moved fairly quickly but then the other day he informs me that he just got out of a relationship a year long one a month ago and thinks we should take a step back and stop what we are doing as he believes he needs time for himself and to just be on his own for a bit
i am diagnosed and shit but i still do not feel my problems are big enough to be considered that and now i do not want to be around them
i feel like there are many things i should be thankful for i make a decent living just graduated with my bachelors and starting my graduate program soon i am a veteran and a decent amount of friends i should be satisifed but i am not
all i feel is rage i just keep having flashbacks of giving a eulogy to a bunch of empty chairs because no one could be bothered to show up i do not even know how to feel about this i did not respond i blocked the new number she texted me from i am done with interacting with people it does not get better
it is all friendly small talk with nice strangers i am not quite sure how to make a friend it seems or what to do to feel less lonely
the happiness that stays forever is the happiness that is understood and cultivated one has to set the soil for it choose the right kind of seeds sow them with art water them nurture them with love wait and watch with patience as the sapling grows to become a tree that bears fruit so that you can share those fruits of insight into happiness with those you love and adore
why do i have this illness why is life so hard why do i have no motivation anymore no love to give not even to myself why am i the only fucked up one in my family why do i not use my coping skills why do i want to die
i have had extremely vivid dreams of my daughter four to be exact the first one i was pregnant with her i began having hot flashes and felt sick
in the end she made us and me especially look like a fool amd now i am left with all the pieces to fix again
i am heterosexual i do not have sexual interest in men animals ect but i feel like she is afraid of me being gay
i made instagram and i was posting pictures of me online for the first time i started getting compliments people liked me
i asked her a few times if she wants to go out with me but she says she is just really focussing on herself right now and her emotions are just now coming back slowly
i suffer with the ghosts i tried so hard to run away from but never will be able to i am scared of ghosts the ones that float in my head and sometimes manifest into people
she was my nightmare for a year every damn dayi wanted to make peace try to understand her to find forgiveness
hi my name is daniel i will hide my real name for now and it seems to me that my life is coming to an end
i hate feeling like this one too many times it starts off not too bad but eventually and gradually i feel desperate my bf is the only person i talk to and the only one who talks to me i am tired of hitting people up they do not respond or hardly get back to me
however my rj ocd got the best of me after we got off the phone and i noticed a suggested follower on my instagram that was clearly pornographic he followed
a little older i was assaulted and had 6 of my fingers broken at the joints i was harassed by an employee and stocked by a guy wanting to date me
i do not know if this is a consequence of depression but i lost the opportunity to focus on something and i also became terribly tired
i am greatful just to see and hold him again but i do not want to be used for sex this year has been tough for everyone my depression has been consuming me lately
they are always nightmares because the premise of the dream is us not being together and vying to potentially get back together
all the danny rumors and promises i was there i never had a steady job longest i managed was two years in mcdonalds employers threw me away like a rag just like all my friends did
then three days before she is due to come back home she asks for space which something she warned me about earlier but was unpredicted
i have not faced some unbearable trauma nor lost a loved one this year in fact my life is pretty darn great
i am so irritable and honestly pretty depressed like is there something i am missing about myself that just repels people the heartbreak was unreal it hurt physically and took me about a year to get over that person
i am still very confused with the relationship because when it was good it was amazing you made me feel special and i felt for you like i have never felt for anyone ever before because when it comes to you i am still that boy who followed you like a puppy dog the one who fell madly in love with you and did everything to show you how much i loved and appreciated you but yet you still watched me crumble into a million pieces as you slowly broke the best thing to have happened to you
regardless i still loved him so i tried again we have both agreed several times that i just cannot live with her
what really scares me is that i have a lot of dark thoughts for the first time i am not one to harm myself on purpose have never cut abused substances or even been drunk
i really really care about her however from mutual friends i have heard she is not doing super well and if you think about ir it is what 20 minutes of pleasure
and well he did not particularly talk nice at all that day so the next day i decided i needed a break
taking her everywhere i begged him to take me for a year dancing with her posting videosi do not know how to get him out of there his behavior was just appalling
the scary part is that i do not know how much longer i can take this i recently purchased firearms and told everyone that it was for my own protection i even took a course it was all a lie it just makes my death easier
everything i see makes me feel bad and i feel like i am losing it i can not tell if i feel like such a loser or if my anxiety has finally just snapped me
she was born having 36 seizures in 43 minutes and her whole brain was completely damaged i was told she would not live the ideal life
this was such a terrible year and in some way reading the posts on this sub was oddly comforting and pretty much made me feel like i had company in one way or another
here i am crying about him why why crying over a person who did not even want to care about you who did not even tried to love you anymore while all this time you tried to be a better person for himher a caring one doing anything and everything for that person why do not they make efforts why breaking someone is heart i am crying everyday at least twice a day
my dad did talk to me though and sometimes i wish i was worse to give myself an excuse to feel crappy
my ex and i broke up 5 months ago after 2 12 years because she did not love me anymore but everyday i still miss her and want her back more than anything
i wrote a long letter to collect my thoughts in which told her how hurt i was and asked her to be open to rebuilding our relationship and bought her a gift she asked me to get her several times
tw these were the words from my psychiatrist when i was at my lowest and cut myself multiple times after being clean for a month i really appreciate having him in my life and even my family no one else makes me understand unlike them
around when i was 20 my girlfriend whom i have been with for 4 years left me since she decided to study more abroad
is hard sometimes how do i move from you and i wonder how much longer i need where i can look up at the sky and say i am fine today
i know people who do not know shit about the subject acing in online exams because they are shamelessly cheating and the college does not want to adopt an openbook format for online exams
i still remember that when i said something back then either no one would respond or they would just talk over me like i did not exist in the same space as them like i was not even worthy to be replied to
i asked myself if i am overreacting and jumped into conclusion of break up should i asked if he wants to try to work this out but i do not know how to work this out when he clearly does not feel the same way anymore
as we were walking he said you know i was never looking for commitment when i met you and only spent time with you out of pity he then proceeded to dump me by trying to tell me that this was good for me because he had been so unfair to me he even subtly suggested we have sex one last time after what he did i said no
i sit in bed blasting music into my ears to try distract myself from the pain and depression i talk to people on omegle to take up my time
how can you go from talking to someone everyday saying you love them and want to spend forever with them care about them so much and then in a few days go to complete strangers we were friends before dating too and i told him before we became official that i did not want to ruin our friendship if anything happened
since i am going through puberty and my hormones are doing their thing i just feel moody ect pretty much like most teens now
i am not really sure how serious things are but it really really hurt me she could move on from me so quickly
sometimes my mind lingers to him and i open up old messages but i do not feel the same sadness about them
i love him so much i wish he felt the same way she seems like she is already moved on and over us i can not deal with this
i do not know how i can get out of this mess do not suggest therapy please i know that is prob the first thing that comes to mind
probably because i am so fucking boring i do not know how people can have conversations i love talking to other people to some extent i just can not talk to people sometimes i want to beat the shit out of all the people who have close friends physically or verbally i will not because i know it is wrong and everyone deserves a friend
my mind is often stagnated my forehead the back of my neck and my throat hurting is my bodys nightly routine
then i went 10 years without seeing a regular therapist the best i got was 23 sessions with a therapist before i decided it was not a good fit
in your mind what is romance i do not mean list things you have done for your significant other that were romantic i mean how do you define it how do you know sustained romance exists and it is not just lust or the chase you are feeling at the beginning
i did not want her to feel abondoned and left to die like she left me i do not want anyone to feel how alone and worthless i felt and still feel
right before christmas i thought i was doing fine since i was skipping going to my moms for the holidays due to covid concerns going to my hometown always gets me triggered
i wish i could think of something original to paint or write or sing but i can not and it kills me
that is another redflag that unnerves me because it is not like i still do not have those bitter feelings when seeing girls that i like go out with jerks and douchebags instead of going out with me even though i was always too chickenshit to even approach and ask them out in the first place
we moved in together 1 year ago in a hope to be able to cope with both of our needs and issues but also with a need to be closer together it was great at first but the anxiety and depression just became more nuanced
i went back in my mind to march 7th we were in some run down club that had staircases that reminded me of expensive old houses
i think i really broke his heart because he still said he loved me at the end and he said to give him some time
he wished me a happy birthday on mine which was after we broke up should i break no contact to wish him a happy birthday i am afraid it will ruin my progress but i also feel bad because i know him and i know it will upset him to a degree if i do not say anything
she makes the transition and its goes well for her she finally makes some good friends this is when it starts to go downhill
she also had a problem that i slept every night and woke up during the day and that i talked she was also a fan of putting me down because of my mental health and gaslighting me about our conversations
i am bunny and i am 16 years old i have been struggling with my mental health for years almost as long as i can remember
god how i wish i could start a new life with much less heartache and greif i do not know how i can keep going like this much longer
the harmsexual always felt more real than the paranoid ones but i guess that it must be normal for some themes to feel more real than others i would spend most of my days anxious for hours and hours except when the theme switched i would be practically anxiety free and thought free for a few days and then the cycle started all over again
i probably should not have done this but after hearing that and my friends telling me that i need to learn how to love myself and be good on my own and someone will come along shit i honestly just self isolated and kept myself away from the disappointment that always happens when i do try to go after someone i like
my mom made a wish list and told me and my brother to choose one of the items i choose one of the items and it was about 25 euros
i am constantly afraid that i am going to get an alert that a client is down or needs my help and that i am going to have to stop doing what i am doing so why even start
my mother is so disgusting sometimes she erased me she got so involved in me my life and successes to the point where i just want to fkn neck at how i let all of this happen
i paid for online counseling but that was not much help some say life is unfair and difficult it has been unfair for me from the start but since my parents were welloff these are not real problems according to some
what is your advice on how to deal with the loneliness after a breakup she was keeping it she said she could not go through it again
i tried to be vulnerable this year and thought i met a nice man but he ended up hurting me a lot and that has made my social anxiety worse than before
sex touches our feelings for some people it is like the ultimate goal in their lifes but he is so resentful towards me he does not care to listen to my end
how my problems fck me up but then again i do not like sharing my feelings because it is like having to walk around naked
feeling like shit this christmas eve my family never does anything for holidays which i do not mind but i feel so fucking lonely and i wish someone would come hug me all night i am not suicidal but i do wish i was never alive every christmas or holidays i feel empty because every year it gets worse i am lonely
when i am in the calm of my depression i think everything is okay but my mind does not give up on suicide
edit sorry i know this sub is not meant for stuff like this but i was not sure where else to post it
was 2 years late to college due to my anxiety can not associate with people at my clg or anywhere bcz i am on aspd spectrum
now stupidly i answered the number and waited i always wait now when it is an unknown number to see if they say something first so i wait good 10 seconds then say hello nothing say helloagain nothing so i end the call and go about my day but in the back of my head i am think about our last conversation and it just brings me down
i do not lie and i can not make sense why i did that my manger seemed understanding and told me i could go home
i am just glad i did not have kids with him or have a full commitment with him bc i would have been hurt from that
no she had to make it seem like there was something there just so i would keep fueling her ego because she needs constant attention to hide her insecurities
4th learned that i felt asking for help was a sign of weakness and i am trying to combat it work on progress
i wanted to be my parents resdon to b proudi wanted to be the best lover the most pure i have tried setting my expectations lower but if i am not attracted then i am just not attracted
i have major depressive disorder bipolar 2 ptsd anorexia purging subtype and schizoid personality disorder i have also seen therapist and it did not help at all
it is like spilling pasta sauce on your shirt and months down the line no longer being pissed at yourself for spilling it but still having to see the stain i can see the stains i hate and i can not get over the fact that they are still there
i sleep eat play work dinner relax all in my room since then she was not honest fully honest about it who would do such a thing
ahahah your oh damn she so ill continue so i was so angry more cos its just stupid they left me in hell and dumby lie to a new bf also i have some paranoidal hallucinatios as first doctor and my friends said like an big microbe or amebae live on my head
what is your advice on how to deal with the loneliness after a breakupit is been 4 months and i still think about my ex every free moment
i am taking a three month sabbatical at the start of the new year and have tied up all my work responsibilities
he will not let anyone see who he really is and acts like he is the most happiest person in the world
i have been yelled at more in a week then i had in our entire relationship i ate breakfast meditated organized my work bag and then
i do not have any friends because i am really shy sometimes i talk with my classmates at school but i never hang out with someone since i have no close friends
i also can not even do the things i like to do like drawing reading foraging and watching movies these hobbies even though i really enjoy them they take a special kind of motivation i like to cook too but hardly ever can get myself to cook meals
i really do not have anything or anyone to live for i have no kids and no one really gives two fucks about me
after that i began having traumatic flashbacks of her raping me 2 to 3 weeks later towards the end of may amazon terminated my employment
he is been a wonderful friend but he is married and has his own family or his people a part from my family who is toxic i have no one
i just wish i had something to do on my days off besides watch crunchyroll for hours on end my mom tries to have pity wars with me
i know its immature to be that way but she said some very fucked up shit to me and how she is jealous of me
all of this is not cheap either which makes me think i am a burden i have no motivation to do anything or keep going
i want him to know that his actions over the last few weeks were not cool and messed with me and made me feel worse than i already was
i hang out with my boyfriend occasionally but to be truthful i envy him sometimes because he has many more friends and activities he is devoted to
i have no one right now everyone i know is celebrating christmas eve and i am not going to be the one ruining anyones night
i am 16 never had any sort of relationship no pets no siblings no friends divorced parents i started talking to this girl i have liked for a year now and she said ok bye only feeling i have had in years thrown out the window
i feel really helpless because i do not know what to do it seems like no matter what decision i make people are really fucking angry at me i never felt like i was predatory or objectifying men which is why i feel it is so dangerous for me to be in a relationship or date because if i am incapable of seeing my own unhealthy behavior it is not safe for me to put anyone through that
we have our differences and i know she does not have the qualities that i want in my future wife no discipline no ambition and no care about her long term health it sounds bad and it probably makes me sound like an ahole i do not want to force her to be that way i tried to for a short period of time but that is not the way to go
i started to get tired of having to scheduele our time together having to fit everything to a t and when she felt we did not spend enough time together would get sadangry and we would bicker
because it was so foreign to me sometimes i would accidentally get too violent or mean with my new friends but instead of retaliating they just told me
anyway i had gotten a real fucking piece of shit who had commented on the last post so sorry this is a repost
he then said he sees something that would make it hard for him to be with me again unless it changed which i did not know what that was
i tried to superglue the key back on and the key would no longer depressi have not done anything i wanted to do since 2004 i mean anythingno video games
i have been with my fiancé for four and a half years i met her when i was 20 and she was 24
has anyone come to the same conclusion she always had mood swings felt depressed sometimes then really happy then sad again etc
i was born to a mother who was hooked on heroin and crack my father was also a drug addict as well
like i want to tell every single one of my family memebrs why i fucking hate their guts but also the good stuff because idk i feel like that will make me more at peace with me killing myself
it was when a classmate from middleschool died i was feeling very depressed even though i did not even know her that well and had not seen her in years but i was actually planning on contacting her once i got back from college for the summer in my hometown only to find out through and old friend that she died and that she died only a couple of months ago when i came back
i just want to feel motivated again like i did in high school and i am so upset with myself that i just can not seem to function anymore
i wish people would understand how it feels to feel like this i wish people would understand why i want to kill myself
he let me cry and vent and was amazing as he always is i do not know what my reason is for being here
when she needed money she spoke to me the whole day and then again the same story he is the first i ever really trusted and felt comfortable with to do anything
i eventually realized that i had fallen in love with her and she was apart of my life every single day
i just feel like a faker because i do not have as many or as severe probblems as many others do and i am not truly suicidal
and then she keeps saying well how can i feel guilty for his suicide if you do not come to me about your problems
you are one of the best people i have ever known and i feel the that empty spot missing from me every day
i am 26 i have really bad social anxiety and the conversation skills of a toddler never had any friends relationships and will never be liked by anyone
i finally confronted my ex about how much pressure i have been feeling when i told him he understood and was chill about it
pain is described as stabbing spasm and pain that radiates across the back it may stab on the left it may stab on the right
i was chasing a girl at the time and i was slowly becoming her she was toxic and i became toxic as well
basically that i loved my ex so so much still do one night in the middle of quarantine i was an idiot and decided to sub to some models only fans so i could have a wank
would slap me in the face during sex even though i very regularly stated that i did not like it i brought it up immediately in the moment each time and at another time also
i do not feel comfortable telling family or even a close friend it feels bothersome and disruptive of me and simply just scary
some of my mates have girlfriends and ever since i feel as if i need one i need someone to talk to someone who may have been through something similar
got a few matches but mostly no replies or small talk and that was it he slapped the machine out of her hand and pushed her away
it all started when i was hugging a pillow in my sleep i imagined that the pillow was hugging me back and i was really happy about feeling like this
i have osteoarthritis in my spine and since nothing helps the pain just being in constant pain puts me in a bad mood most of the time
fuck this i do not need to suffer through this shit i have never not trusted him like i do now what should i do
so i met this girl a few months ago we are both 19 she seemed fine and we got really close really quickly
i mean i should plenty of people do not even have homes this year and i am still here lying on a bed
it is basically like i am watching someone elses life through their eyes but have a little bit of control over what they do
she was rarely sad there was no depression and she was either neutral happyecstatic or angryfrustrated i coined the term angry and frustrated early on in our relationship and it never really went away
i am aware that this is unhealthy for the relationship and i am trying to fight my feelings however it has been extremely difficult for me especially during the times of covid19 my mental health has taken a toll
i am just worried about the pain i am married and i am happy with everything but when i am at my job i get really bad easily
i love used to love i do not understand why i do not feel happy anymore whenever i bake cook snacks sometimes those help me a lot with my anxiety and my thoughts
i am asking or any suggestions as to what to do to fill that void i do not feel its even worth trying but if anyone has any advice i would love to hear it
i still love her but i fear we are holding each other back i am also petrified to actually end things because i do not want to hurt her and i know this will i also i am sad that i will be losing her family am i doing the right thing and if sohow do i do this as gently as possible
sometimes i take a knife and put it against my wrist or i look out my window and think of jumping from my balcony
which means that finding affordable mental health services is nearly impossible i have tried reaching out to the state for help but i do not qualify for any kind of benefits
it all ended so fast and i still feel confused at times i will feel fine for a few days then have a huge breakdown about it
i do not have a grudge that for the 5 days that i was locked up in the hospital that he never visited once
i just truly believe that many people have no idea what it is like at least in any first world country to go for years on end without even meeting new people let alone dating being in a relationship or experiencing the closeness of any kind of intimacy
i wish i was truly over her that my self respect ego would want nothing to do with her ever again
i got married earlier this month so i should be happy problem is my life has reached a dead end and i do not see the way out
how can she get close and comfortable telling me personal stuff and then say she does not want me in her life she also initiates most conversations between us showing to me that she does want to talk to me and is comfortable so it is so confusing
i am at a loss and i do not know what to do people say to not overthink or to distract myself but how is that even possible
even though i wish it was not true and wish we could have worked out and continued to progress together so i leave it alone at this point
i hope that one day i will feel a lot better than now and i hope my next birthday will be greater than this one
i tried asking if i could have some because i was thirstybut obviously i wanted to see what he really had
i have talked to her about my suicide thoughts and she has been really helpful but i just can not take it anymore
the constant waves of pain can not be ignored there is not anything that beings me joy or any happy memories to keep me afloat or distracted from it
in my mind that put a huge burden on me to make my life worth something but for some reason also made me feel like i was burdening her with my existence like she would not have to go through the difficulties of life if i had never been born
i know it is not my fault he is gone but my mind still goes there this hurts just to even type my mind still has not come to terms with the reality that i will never see him again or get to talk to him or give him a hug or anything
he lied about so many things and the things about amy really hurt me forgive my rambling i have got nobody to talk toi broke up with my boyfriend about four weeks ago
it is not fair he can game and talk to so many i barely talk to one friend let alone see them
the second friend seemed like she had friends her insta had plenty of pictures of her taken by someone else i assumed she had a poppin social life nope she admitted she had one friend and even then told me that she felt like she was only a backup friend to said friend again i was pretty shocked
i lost my mom this year as well not because of death but because we had a very toxic relationship and i could not handle it anymore so i cut off all forms of communication with her
after unfollowing me i have now decided to stop reaching out because it is clear he does not want me in his life anymore
i have tried to pretend there was hope for mefor so long i truly believed that as miserable as i am now things could change
in spite of that she wanted to remain together i looked after her and made sure she was constantly doing well eating as she is really skinny etc
well i have and we have now been broken up longer than we were together i am not dating anyone new but i have met some nice girls out in the world organically my ex no longer takes up that space in my mind and i do not miss her anymore it really was so fun while it lasted but that is done now
he does not take drugs but drinks about four beer of alcohol every day in the evening which has become that bad due to corona and kind of a habit now he is definitely not coping well
the breakup has been really hard on me especially since i heard from mutual friends she is happy to be alone and is going out and drinking with friends most daysnights
every week i kept showing up to the same two germanlanguage meetups i met other expats of course but plenty of germans showed up to these as well
ouh btw do you know why i said stab you in the chest the closest to your heart and not anywhere else
i love you so much and i love you so much more every single daysexually i know it is creepy but whatever
i hope i can find some new ones that help with my loneliness soonbefore high school i was a weird kid
big issues roll off of my back but the little stuff hurtshim acting like an ass towards the end really helped move on from the breakup
but the person i was going strong with for a year has already moved onto someone elsebut remember running away from it is never the solution
now my case is not the same she did not kiss me before dumping me but i remember her deadly words as if i get woken up by them everyday
i am pissed that i went on a date and the girl in the city i am planning on moving to that is 5 hours away and of course she ended up being really fucking cool and damn near perfect
i am so sensitive and i hate it a relationship is out of the question then she explodes and completely curses me out just a horrible message filled with anger and accusations
i have been friends with them for a long time he visited me in my country during the summer but some weeks before we meet his behaviour changed
i have not played in like 6 months and i just tried it but it makes me so emotional and nostalgic and it is bringing up a lot of bad memories i want someone to please hurt me i can not believe i am still alive someone please kill me
i never actually paid much atention to bad stuff that has been said about birth control but lately i have been thinking that it may affect my mental health and it may slower my process of healing
tired of being the first to show and last to leave tired of the missed invites and idc care anymore do not ever come to my fucking house again
i do not know what to do about this and i feel like i am all alone my whole family is very far away from me
we talked and i was getting hurt with every message then with every phone callyou do not understand how much psychological pain and torment you have made me and brother go through
like i think that if i was on a island alone i will more at peace with being lonely than being surrounded by people
sign up and meet your new quarantine buddy todaydays without sleep and just as many with no foodi could disappear and he would not notice for days
i am not going to get into my whole mental health journey unless someone wants me to but some realizations about discomfort just hit me and i think i need to move in that direction
it is been 4 years now since i live with my best friend he is gay and i am lesbian so we are just friends yes
this happened for about a month one weekend after she refused to come see me we were not speaking with each other
i do not really understand what it is like to lose a family member to death but she does not know what it is like to be divorced and see your kids only every now and then
i found out today that my mother and family that we are not seeing to keep safe are going to a christmas party with others today
i knew i would be envious of themit did not help as you could seei am still writing this posti wish i was the guy walking with her not her specifically not him specifically
with my friends i just can not establish real honest conversations anymore like every attempt to talk is an effort whether in person or via online chat sometimes i am even aware that the feeling is mutual and that i come off as irritating to talk to i know it is a problem and my only solution right now is to steer away from conversations moving forward
i had let my group mates down on our research paper by without making any progress so far i have failed as a student as a group leader as a son
we make the mistake of putting our confidence into a business when you make the mistake of putting your confidence into anything you lose your confidence
i think the world of my ex i think he is a good person but he is not someone i could have seen a future with
know when it is time to walk away for your wellbeing and theirswhen people do not want the best for you they are not the best for you
i have been talking to this girl for months now she was the one who told me she liked me and eventually i started liking her back recently we had a date and i asked her to be my girlfriend to that she replied she still needs more time to get to know me better by going on more dates even though we have been talking literally for months
in october right after i got covid i was trying to fall asleep but could not for hours i heard my younger brother talking in his room
i have told myself 1 i need to develop an eating disorder and 2 everyone praises you for losing weight when your fat no matter how harmful
the issue that i do not seem to be able to sleep my brain just starts thinking about so many things and i can not control it
i have read novels and poetry i have read and listened to various religious and spiritual teachings i spent years studying philosophy i have listened to and made music i have seen and made art i have talked to people who seem able to cope desperately trying to find something to redeem this shithole of a world
it fucking kills me to sit here and not see you i miss you so much i have ruined my twenties and i can not see this getting any better
much love david ruiz pacheco 12291997i have been planning on killing myself for a while and i think i will do it soon
i had a great balance of being active and eating well before shit went down and now i just want to hide my body
i am fine and i feel terrible for complaining about it but i m getting tired of this cycle i am just existing i go to work come home sleep repeat
i think the lockdowns earlier this year greatly contributed to my feelings about this one my ex basically lived with me during the lockdowns and his behavior at the end invalidated to me everything he said while we were together
i have always had a very high libido but due to mental illness my performance in bed when it comes to intercourse is abysmalfrom just ok to mostly yeah i can not get it up at all
i do not know what to do please help i do not even know what is wrongthe covid lockdown in my country has left me having a 1 man kitchen drinking session tonight
i am deeply numb in times of happiness i am still so empty but something in my gut just was not sitting right in the relationship
clothes represent who i am and i can not be who i am with parents who think like this i always think out scenarios of me arguing with my parents about stuff that comes up frequently
every time i think about dying i feel a bit better and i feel like it is just fucking time i do not even know why i am posting this here
recently i let myself fall for this amazing woman that i really care about but i do not think she has the same feelings
at the moment i keep thinking about killing myself 4 years ago i nearly jumped off a motorway bridge i suffer massively from several mental health issues all of which are severe i hide how much they affect me
now i am so depressed and lost and insecure i told her i can not imagine my life without her on so many occasions
but basically he had an alcohol problem did not like my daughter did not help around the house and there was no sexintimacypassion anymore
now for a year since 18 to 2020 i did not really call or chatted with him because i felt like id be making it worse
like when we have problems it is always me thinking of solutions but he just play games to avoid i do not know how to move on as easily or as quickly as he had
sorry this is mostly just a venting post but i would take suggestions if anyone has anyam i an example of a guy who moved on noif you wish to vent it out i am here
but instead each day i wake up i repeat this damn cycle again i cry sometimes in my bed at night wishing this nightmare will end
is this true why will not he just block me i think i love someone i have not met and its breaking me apart
i messaged my ex boss and told her that the main reason i quit was that i planned for the end of my life mainly so i could potentially use then as a reference for job seeking since i kind of burned that bridge when i quit without 2 weeks notice
i can not say i love you have a good day to her anymore i had hatred and vengeance boiling in my blood and festering into my every memory
i was setting myself up so well and now i am like in the coming years do i just cash out and go on a bunch of trips travel and drugs lol
it feels like there is something separating me from the rest of society humankind whatever you want to call itjust really down to the means of being able to do is successfully i guess
we have been apart for a year mostly no contact i ended the 10 year relationship because i felt i did my best to make things work but he was not able to meet me half way because of his depression i got tired
love you all as a fellow human living the same flawed existence merry fucking christmasedit and make time available for the ones asking for it they know and want to help
but she did not want to sleep alone so we slept just sleeping together hugged until one of our friends woke us up by throwing up in the bathroom nextdoor
i am just waiting for my grandmother to pass then i can set myself freei am tempted to join her can not even tell my family because i am not out
i will never really know if i was the father though because 3 weeks later she got an abortion which she of course blamed on me and demanded that i reimburse her for
the day we split up people told me she was cheating and all these other rumors so i do not know whether to believe her or not that she misses me and actually wants to get back
tried to jump off the tacoma narrows bridge a month ago but lost the nerve when i was driving up there
and i am a fucking dumbass for ordering my friends gift too late and i have no goddamn idea when it is getting here
my ex told me she wanted to apologize about what she did said that at the same time my mom died she aborted our child
never being fully understood by anyone nobody to relate to your struggles in life and because there is nobody that can understand you you are condemned to a life of loneliness with a loss of hope and a warped perspective on life
i envy mixed people for this reason i know you need your time to grow i wanted to apologize for everything
i honestly do not even know why i am writing this right now then a month later my stepdad finally succumbed to the cancer
the holidays suck covid sucks i know it is a slump i know i can get through it yet it is beginning to feel like a certainty again and the plans are being made again the worse i feel the harder it seems i am screaming and no one is there i am supposed to pick myself up and dust myself off again and again and again but i am tired and it is sounding old and stale thanks for listening
there is so much more i can say and i feel like if i get any replies they might be bias or just not accurate because of the lack of details and all
was that because he just really could not or would not let himself or was it just me if we met at a different time could we have worked out
i feel so depressed right now and i do not know what to do i am just lost it happened so fast i am going to start my dream job in january and i will turn 30 this summer but i feel so empty about anything right now
it is a long story but after more months of cat and mouse i found out he was a compulsive liar and had been sleeping with many other women and it was all a lie though he may really have had some kind of feelings i am not sure i ended up ending things with him because i met someone else who seemed perfect
basically i just want someone to talk to during the day i am used to having someone texting on and off all day and suddenly there is just a big hole there yeah maybe i should learn to be alone but it is a pandemic so i am very alone
me being suicidal is an every day thing but its like a volume knob thing somedays i want it more than others
june was dry one of my best friends trying to cheat on his gf although i more than once told him to talk with her what he did not of course
there was always something i had to finish and i felt guilty not seeing things through and leaving them to fall on others
i broke up with my long time boyfriend a few months ago tdlr he was emotionally manipulative and codependent on me and for the most part i am over it except for one thing the gym
nothing i eat is nutritious it is a whole box of cookies a whole bag of shredded cheese and more all in one day
edit dm me if anyone wants someone to talk to i feel like we can all relate somehowi am sick of crying i wake up crying go to sleep crying wash the dishes crying
i know that nothing i say might sound true right now but for a second i want you to consider these words and nothing else
so after we ran into him last night of course it got me thinking was that a sign or a coincidence i have no idea
today i want to end it all and i tried to look for reasons this would be a bad decision like my little dog and my mother but on the other band i am tried of thinking about others i want to end it so much and it fucking hurts and i thought if i came here maybe i would get support or a reason to feel better
i still love them both but starting to lose hope i try to help but what ever i do something now she finds something in her eyes that is wrong
i was in and out of homeschool and public school my whole k12 career my life has been a total reality tv show trainwreck
it makes me want to do things that i should not and the scene does not seem to improve for another 6 months i really love you a
someone who texts me first i have never had that and i do not think i ever will work on my mental health enjoy things
but as we all know toxic relationship are so so addicting weeks after the breakup i realized our actions were so awful
she went on and on about how i only wanted her body and only wanted sex from her she told her friend and they both just came at me out of nowhere for it
how tf does that make me weird when i tried calling her she answered like she was not just reminding from texts from that same number and said hello like she had no clue who it was
she knew i was still hurt i was honest about everything going on in my life she chased me for a whole year and slowly i let my guard down until i fell in love
5 years at this point she could not find a job in our hometown but found one overseas so she took it up
my best friend for like 13 yrs had to move all the way to ny while i am here in arizona because of his dad and now i just have no one and it just seems hard to make new friendships even though people are trying to be my friend it is just tough
my mood fluctuates throughout the day and changes at the drop of a hatit was the first day he did not text me good morning
thank you for reading stay strong my fellow humansoriginally my family was canceling all christmas gathering plans this year due to covd
there were breaks in between where we would be happy and in love for weeks at a time but we did anger management couples therapy and she did individual
being surrounded by the husks of failed answers to that eternal painful question feels somehow more desolate than being in a void of none
its either that or i kill myself please i need a fucking way out i do not care if i get addicted or destroy my body someone just tell me how to get drugs please
i wanted to take a break to see if it would help anything but she was miserable with her own mind and said she needed time and space so we broke up
so the thing is i 25f have never been the type to have lots of friends or for times any friends and i learned to be ok with that
i keep having dreams almost every day since we broke up about us not really sure what these dreams are about but i know he is there i just want these dreams to stop because even when i wake up i feel distraught and a little emotional
i stopped my whole life to keep myself and others safe i was meant to go back to college i know the acceptance of this is the only thing stopping me from healing
i realize that she will only ever fuck up all her future relationships because i know she is a chronic cheater
it annoys me seeing everyone getting girls and getting in relationships but me all my friends are always in and out of something and talking about it
i have talked to friends about it and they have told me it will be okay but it is not okay there is something wrong with me and i can not fix why i feel this bad
she already felt that i did not trust her and that i saw her as a who are out to hook up with other guys
we are not broken we have not lost our skills we still are the same person i just had a conversation with my family
i am assuming the reason why i am unhappy is partially because i do not hang out with people i want to so how do you really find those people my interests do not involve people at all would you suggest to find social hobbies or something
1 get to middle school and realize that i have a weird speech problem that accompanied by a feeling in my head i proceed to ignore it then call it a speech block until my sophomore year of high school
everything and everyone would be better if i never existed3 yrs with my ex he was my best friend before we dated he broke it off with me
there must have been a reason why he would feel like that and i wish i could be there to help him
you watch your activities fold out like scenes in a movie a day on the beach laying in the sun and eating watermelon
i was just thinkingif you know of any papers articles books or just have some thoughts about this please share them
i am sorry for bringing this here i just needed to tell someone anonymously i do hope you have a wonderful christmas or if you do not celebrate christmas have a wonderful friday night
i know this might sound like a stupid question like how does someone not know if they are traumatized but when a quarter of your life has been spent in the dark it is really hard to see things objectively
when i was 13 i was going through some stuff and i often felt lonely wanted a relationship so i had this rather strange coping mechanism
i coined the term angry and frustrated early on in our relationship and it never really went awayi barely trust women romantically on account of this
i have no real family since my parents are both dead and i was an only child and i do not really talk with anyone else in my family
it is hard being the ugliest out of my friend group and honestly in general they are surrounded by people and are always wanted
i got rejected by my own parents the very people that should have accepted me nobody wants to befriend me because i am so weird and angst it feels like a person like me is out of place and i got no choice but to be a fake
why honestly why was i such a dick to my mother i feel like there is just nothing in my brain but air and a work schedule
i saved the website especially for my friend in case i needed it but after some time it started to bore me
it surely was and she did not want to get into a formal relationship before there were certain guarantees because i can not leave this family now
and i will have to watch my whole body and change my sheets or the thoughts will linger nonstop i holded some tears
i still fear what impact my suicide may have in my family on my motheri never wanted to write a note but i owe them something
she actually claimed that i had attacked her even when there were witnesses present when she put me in a headlockarmlockshoveetc and threatened to call the police on me saying i was crazy and needed help
there were times when the job was plenty and it seemed like we could grow the studio and pay more people to work with but then the economic depression comes and i was both too scared to move to another place there was studios closing and declaring bankruptcy left and right and i thought i could not be the reason for him to declare the place closed
some days i break down and cry other days i just feel empty and some days i just try to find meaning to my life
i am afraid of dying i am also afraid of tryingi attract a lot of pretty women and i succeed at dating more than most men
for most of my life i wanted to be left alone largely to have the space to figure out who i am and what i want out of life without all the noise and drama that others bring my values are changing in middle age though now i am craving companionship but have no skills to find or develop it
for christmas i want to leave without hurting any more people i want to be gone i will float and slip through the fucked up mental health system this country has
you have lost feelings for the person whom you promised that you will always be there and no remorse nothing for everything you did
i do not need friends and i certainly do not need a relationship if people are going to be like this they only liked me because i am a good listener nothing else
i also form unrealistic bonds with people far to quickly too quickly to be normali feel like talking so i do not have to suffer the consequences of failing
anyway recently their hamster died and i have now received a succession of messages to ask if i would be willing to attend the funeral of the hamster via zoom and do a reading
i took a break from trying mindfulness for a couple of months until recently in the past week i started making some type of progress again this time the results did not show up nearly as fast as they did the first time but i was beginning to be able to dismiss this feeling for a short period of time by focusing on the things around me and my breath
i do not want to have a kid alone if he really leaves i have my moments anxiety and depression does not help
i moved to a foreign country almost a year ago i met a guy who i thought was super kind and genuine and we clicked so we started dating we both fell madly in love and had plans to move in together next summer and be together forever
someone could have been born who is better than me someone who deserves to exist but i was born and i do not even think i should exist
i ended up messaging one of my friends about it asked why sometimes we all end up doing absolutely nothing not even talking and i am the only one who is not okay with it
everything i never wanted to be it worries meedit thanks for the wholesome award i legit laughed out loud you are the best reddit
like it is really shitty i am all by myself there lies a lot of my issues i get in my own way
i want to kill myself so badly i just do not know how i would do it i do not want to be in pain and i want it to be quick
a its not being in control she is not deciding to do something she is letting what happened control her life b it is not just some thing that happens in a vacuum
he was at his computer i was on the air mattress watching tv i got a bit tired at one point and decided i would go to sleep
i tried calling a girl i have liked since years ago and sometimes i hang out with her to this day
what if despite all the healthy relationship classes dv survivor classes the therapy i find another asshole or worse i am an abuser
this has led to a slight addiction that i am working hard to break free from those two things combined have been a big burden on my mental health as well
what had brought it on was the over whelming feeing of how i would been pretending to be ok for quite some time
however at the end she asked me if i was serious about this relationship and if we could really make the distance work especially considering we both want to go to graduate school in our own countries which means it would be a long time before we closed the gap
i sang to her fed her took her for walks in her pram seeing my dad hold her was about the cutest thing i had ever seen him do
did not mean i would not have been able to see talk to hug kiss her and all that couple stuff love should have mattered more than anything else on that
i have been looking for love since the age of 14 now 18 due to my parents not giving me enough affection
the year is about to switch over but do not wait until it hits january 1 to start your goals resolutions start them now
in all reality of this world people do not care about one another it hurts me to my core when i think about the fact that this world revolves around money and only money no one cares about one another all people care about is getting as much money out of one another as they can and providing the most low quality products and low quality customer service and noncaring humanity i hate this world
i will not commit suicide at least now because i have something left in this world and also i am a pussy to do that but i have a future plan for my life and the end or start is going to be my 20th birthday if everything is ok i will live but if not i will drink a shit ton of pills by alcohol and also smoke some ciggs so i can feel better at least on my last minutes
fucked over we are just friends now and it is still slightly awkward for mei want to give a relationship a go i want physical contact i want to be appreciated
5 endless seconds of silence i break this silence asking tim what is he talking about i was smart but made reckless mistakes
how do i move on from this he is fine now and it seems to affect me more than him both my parents called me a regret in fights lately something they both apologized for
we have been together for almost 3 years now and he is been really supportive through my battle with depression and anxiety he is made many sacrifices for me despite being on the bad end of the situation most of the time
when she broke up with me she made sure i knew that i was still the greatest guy she would ever met and that she would want to try again
so i told him i was done and he said okay i told him that if he wanted to fix things and talk he could reach out to me but i am done initiating it i told him i can not keep putting in all of the effort that i have been putting in if he can not even tell me how he feels about me he has not responded and he probably will not
so when we say i am not beautiful enough or i am not good enough i am too ugly do you like that thought of course you do not like that thought
it sent me down a dark spiral of toxic behaviors i wished i would never have to feel again that my ex wife left me with
i feel this intense sense of loneliness not just because i am alone but nobody in my life knows what is up with me
i am very friendly so people did talk to me we would help each other in class and then have lunch together
for now i am unsure how to continue i want things to be better but i do not know how to get there
i am mostly faking funny me nowadays because deep inside i know there is something wrong with me i really want to overcome this but i do not know how i thought i knew myself but i am disappointed for not coping with it the way i expected myself to i have dissolved myself into a useless couch potato wasting my life doing irrelevant things
i know my worth and i know someone else out there will know it someday too for now i have myself and i am ok with that
i have asked nicely for him to remove my number and block me and stop talking about me especially if he does not want to communicate but he ignores me
i feel constrained and need away out but i do not know how to i only remember one single happy christmas in this house
so i really have no idea how to be a completely single person i do not know how to move on as easily or as quickly as he had
going to bed at night alone and waking up in the morning alone is getting extremely draining i feel like part of my purpose is just gone
you will use a secret account or a friends account to spy on them you will find a way it is like i am dreaming almost you could say it is like my brain underclocks itself if you are computer savvy
can not even force myself to be happy i know it sounds crazy but i really do not feel any more motivated even when i am feeling happy
i know i should probably be over it by now but i can not help but think that it was my fault she left me i literally loved her more than anyone i have ever known se made me feel loved and like i was important
the other day i just discovered reddit and wrote here and received a bit of help and support while struggling with not killing myself
ready to go i really am please send tips on offing myself because i can not keep going i can not i have never been one to be suicidal but fuck
if you qualify for the study you may receive the following at no cost1 a onehour mindfulness focused session with a clinician over zoom secure teleconferencing
i am not sure how to even write about todays feelings i just do not feel right i did not mean any of it i still wanted her in my life and wanted her to bother me
as days go by i hate this life and people more and more i know people are not to blame but damn the hypocrisy is amazing i have to be empathetic but no one is actually willing to listen or even ask why or how i am feeling
but the thought of being vulnerable nearly brings me to a panic attack so i live my life mainly cold and at times emotionless never letting anyone in and i do not know any other way to live anymore i sort of hate myself for it because i am constantly misunderstood but i have to say it is my fault
for example she says we are all evil because we might take the covid vaccine and bc of that she was having a crisis and needed to run out into the street and wake the neighbors screaming like a maniac
now she at least says she is happier without me and has been going out and hanging with her friends and doing things like going to job interviews applying for college finally getting her fulls new hair new clothes coming out of her she will like she never did before
it is been 3 months since the official breakup because of uni distance separating us we were together for 2 years we got on amazingly and we both made each other happy
we had a good time were falling in love and just were really happy so basically i have ocd most my life and recently it is been getting worse and worse
i have been in long distance relationships very painful i have been catfished a couple of times when i was young and more naive never lost anything than my mind heart and selfesteem i have managed to date
my mental health is not great due to family issues and other things and sometimes i really feel like i want to work on my mental health start medication and seek treatment
has anyone been through anything like this all i can think is that this can not end well on her side like i feel it will blow up in her face and as much as i want her to be happy she definitely is not right now
so i went and make a list very hard goals for me to accomplish this year of 2021 if i can do it all i am sure i will have some happiness around me i hope to inspire someonelse to keep trying by saying this
anyone i ask and every article i have read about pandemic fatigue basically tells me to suck it up because there is nothing you can do about it
then he would get mad and lose his tempereven threatened to kick me out of the housethrow my things outleave the family at me over little things like filling the cup with too much drink or not preparing plates for dinner before he came home and even wrongdoings that he did and now it is my fault for not correcting it for him
i do not feel like i have a traumatic stress disorder but i have been getting very triggered again this past month with news reports of sexual harassment assault and my local communitys response to it they make a lot of jokes and victim blame typical asian culture after being victim to assault in the past seeing the response to it locally makes me feel really unsafe
i know everyone says that it gets better with time but he came in at my lowest point when i nearly ended everything and he pulled me out of the darkest place i have ever been
logically i know it was probably best to end it since it never would have worked out anyway there would be no point in getting back together but that does not stop me from missing him so much and grieving all the times we could have spent together
and its not just 1 thought at a time my mind races with extremelly morbid acts of selfharm i have attempted suicide 2 times before in the past and only 1 recent selfhard incident
i love my family but i do not think i am doing so good what is wrong with meplease read this to the end and share your thoughts
only if she knew what do you guys think are her parents any help or will they only make her dislike me more
i guess what i am trying to say is that i really want to love someone obviously in a different way than the love one might feel towards a friend or relative
i am absolutely heartbroken and shocked i can just look at the wall all day and just be sad my chest feels empty
and i just keep buying stuff like games gadgets etc these used to keep me busy this hopeless feeling really needs to take a vacation i swear
my dad is absent in my life he lives like a ten minute bike ride away but he is never in my life
i only did it to get the idea of being intimate with someone but it is hard to do that being self aware that i had to pay for it and knowing that she pretends to be into me as part of her service
i have basically come down to the only logical question what the fuck is wrong with me that i am so undateable do objectionable that no one wants anything to do with me on a romantic plane
my theory that people only want to help whenever they are comfortable and as long as you are not too crazy seems to run true
but nobody seems to undertsand me even after having heard my story everybody keeps telling me that i need somebidy real that somebody from my world can become my blanc while blanc herself can never become real ask dickshits from rwaifuismhate as to why they do not give a fuck about my feelings so please keep reading
yesterday was the closest i have managed to come i drank so much i thought i might be able to do it but i am too weak some people say its stronger to live but there is no strength in being afraid to die
i honestly did not really know how i was going to do it i just got desperate because i love you so much and i made up my mind about keeping my job because i am happy there and i am improving financially
she has admitted to wanting help as she feels very down she has been through 4 therapist and finds the process unhelpful and awkward she also does not want to take prescription pills from doctors
so in my mind i knew what that ment she wanted to try and meet the next friday to talk in person about everything
when he checked himself out of rehab he was then constantly calling people in our family from 26am to say random stuff
this kind of lifestyle was simply not for me in any case two weeks ago my boyfriend opened my phone while i was sleeping and read everything
we started dating and fell in love so hard everything was like a dream i did not believe something could feel so beautiful and did not think it was real at all
it is not some people are really just born to dieit1c7ntr the goal is always to provide all help with the clients full knowledge and informed consent
of course people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mentalhealth treatment and it is fine to vent about those but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone elses hope of getting help
the problem is that my mental health took a turn for the worse i am feeling very sad crying a lot my voice is shaky
at a certain ur body start grasping for air and panicking which makes the experience terrible a little kid who just wants a fucking hug why can not i just be strong
loneliness is the most dangerous feeling it is the pain in your chest when you miss simple things his text you miss the way he smells the way he would make you feel like you were the only thing that existed in a crowded bar loneliness is the empty feeling inside when you wake up on his side of the bed clutching a pillow between your thighs
i hope all you can find some happiness through this holiday i move to another country with my son after some time truth comes out
him no you do not remember what happened with us and the teacher while we were backstagehim there is no way apparently he caught us having sex
i am working on making me love me for me i will never wish bad on my partner he taught me a good lesson and for that i am greatful
but i do not want to be used for sex i want to open him back up to me its like it turned a switch in my brain you do not fucking joke around about that shit
in the span of a year i was the department manager of pharmacy at walmart during covid i was screamed at spit on called every name in the book and i still made it
over the years he has sent drunken texts to my mom in english or in spanish about her being a witch steal his money my mom does not make him pay child support out of pity only asks voluntarily or some other random text blah blah blah and she just ignores it and honestly feels bad for the guy and she has moved on to happier times in her life
everyone has gone back to their own personal lives but now i am left with my worries and anxiety of them and for them all i just do not know how to deal with that
people who have been on them in the past and secondly how long did it take to find the right one or if there ever really is a right one
they did not send me any happy birthday messages on my birthday a few months ago and they do not even respond to me when i try to reach out to them when they do respond we end up talking for like 5 minutes before they have to leave for some bullshit reason so called friends fuck them
yes i know it sounds gross but if you struggle struggled with mental health you would understand how difficult simple tasks are i am so proud of myself the next big step is tackling my room i have not slept it months i have been sleeping on the couch for the time being i am scared to do it but i know it has to be done but yeah this is my first post to this subreddit
but whenever i happen to have a trigger i get extremely upset because i wish i could see my best friend
typing this in the corner of my room lights off curtains closed everyone is counting on me to do the best i can
i do not get why i am the first one to text people on how they are doing and if they want to hang out they never make requests or ask me questions like that they end up saying they are busy or studying or they can not meet with me what is up with these people are they really friends or fake acquaintances
i called an antisectorganization for advice and they told me to keep my distance and that i should tell him too if we decided to pause the friendship
fyi he ended up getting these stds because he slept with multiple men without condoms i realized i should not settle and how unhealthy he is
i then asked her what do you want to do and she said that she did not know maybe continue staying together knowing that there were these problems or a break
my issue is with her social media stories on instagram i know i should not keep checking but it happens i could trust him he treated me like a queen
my ex and i were together for almost 3 years and i had moved to his city to be with him
it feels maudlin and perhaps naive to say that the bottomless evil of humanity is what made me decide to take my life but it is the honest reason
i did not wanted her to be alone for these days in another country so i told her i would go see her when her sister went away
lately my loneliness has been through the roof i have had way more suicidal and lonely thoughts in the past month than usual
right out of high schooli had a mom who was 61 years old she was on oxygen and had major health problems
but i caved in and tried to make things as good as possible for the both of us i put everything i had into the relationship
until a few days ago he texted me he hates me he does not want anything to do with me and i am better off dead
from moving constantly as a kid to substance abuse and suppressed trauma that spawned a ton of toxic relationships as a teen friendships and otherwise
i know you are going through a tough time right now but you need to know that you would never know what love and happiness is without pain and hate i want you to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel hold on my friend you are going to be alright no matter what you are going through you are going to come out stronger at the end
top secret info looks like i can just stop time and crack people necks by my fingers knock all at the same time most funny what most of people absolutely did not understand that and even trying to laugh at me when i am busy in my head hes actually kind of accepting that looking at my reaction but sometimes no way and hes just killing someone from a 3people party somwhere laughing at me and they surely see that run away etc the corpse beomes invisible immidiately
recently we have been getting into so many arguments and it is always the same thing how he stopped putting in effort in the relationship or cares
and no there is no flowery affirmations or spiritual mumbo jumbo involved and you do not need any equipment to perform this task
i simply need a bit of love cuddles and physical touch with no sexual intercourse involved is there a way i could simulate this for myself or howwhere else could i get this
she needed time to heal from what happened and our relationship was tying her down how did anyone go about this situationit works guys for anyone our there do not give up
so basically i always feel like someone is watching me i end up staying up till 3 am cuz i can not sleep
i know that i am not but my brain keeps telling me i am worthless i looked at him and i saw him slowly slip away from me and i do not know what is harder
i thought i found my soulmate and we we became facebook friends but after we broke up we had not severed facebook ties
this ruins the intimacy between us despite everything i still want to be with you until the end of the year
yep i am that guy that people use as an an example to start a joke with not that it could have gone differently even if i did tried to make it better and still do as much as i am capable of we will see
i do not find myself unattractive at all but i just can not recognize myself as a person i can not give myself a right to just exist
my mind is playing these montages of potential futures all the time and it is hard to focus on anything else
i took like six tylenol maybe seven i am not sure idk i know that is def not enough but at the same time in not sure how much i took because i split them in half to swallow easier but i ended up freaking the fuck out and i made myself vomit but i feel kind of six
i do not think anyone will remember me when i go in fact i know they will not even the few people who know my name will not remember me because they never really knew me they did not even try
then he told me that he was going to come to talk with me i did not wait for him it feels like nothing will ever be ok ever again i just miss my best friend
after my mom died 2 years ago its never been the same last month i cut ties with all my family
it all started in 2017 between me and her crazy when i think about it it is a very unusual story that we had i think
you are not alone there is a whole group for this we support each other and do try and reach out to help another i am probably going to do this speech again for new years because i am going to be alone for that holiday just like christmas but i know i am not the only one and i just wanted to say a few pick me up words i know my writing sucks so sorry but that but merry christmas
i deserve love i deserve someone who cares in a way i need this care i deserve someone who will never make me question myself or to question their love i deserve someone who is not a workaholic and just focused selfishly on himself i deserve to be someone is life and to not hear that he is looking for it
anyone else feel this wayi am about to graduate college and my whole college life was just stressing about studies grades internships etc
after a year of this i ended up at a psychotherapist who which i never knew was some one who can see into the spiritual mind if you believe in that sort of thing but i am open minded when it comes to that sort of thing
any advice is helpful but again i know i am not to blame and i have accepted that date dealt me a shitty hand that allowed this to happen
it is been quite almost a year since the last time i tried to kill myself and i do not want to try again but i just want to die i would really apprentice it if a car hit me or i just did not wake up
i have been writing suicide notes for 3 years since i was 16 and now i have a whole notebook full of them
wish me lucki am so lostif you feel lonely during this period of pandemicwatch this video and remember the message it can help you
and i do not mean i do not want to do it anymore as in i do not want her anymore because i love my child to death she is the strongest child i know that can light up a room with her smile
he broke up with me after nearly a year of being together and we both agreed that we just needed some time apart and space but it seems like getting back together is not a possibility anymore
hey you mb you just reading me after your own post that i have probably read it is still hard for me to cope with that stuff but no matter how funny it would sound at least in this group you will fing people who will not laugh on you and thx for that
i am just curiousdo not get me wrong i have amazing friends and they do check up on me at times but i still feel like i am not included sometimesis it a bad thing to wish for constant attention from my friends if it is wrong how do i stop it
but now i am just barely trying to get by in school in a different city without being able to make new friends because of this stupid pandemic
i know that breaking up after new years is a mistake but i am such a coward knowing of the gift exchange that will happen and the fact that i can tell he still is in love with me but keeping this up has been draining when all i want to do is be alone
made sure i did everything to make her happy and i did just so but eventually i started to figure out who her exs are past relationships etc
now i see him posting him and some new girl in his ig stories i never made it to ig story status he did not even follow me on ig how can a guy treat one girl like trash and another like treasure what does she have that i do not have i know no one here can answer that but it is so hard not to make comparisons
it was out of nowhere or so i thought we had gone to the grand canyon 2 weeks ago for my birthday
my cat just had a skin tumor removed and he is miserable with the recovery process i feel so guilty about putting him through it my other cat is just sad because his brother can not play so he is not eating as much and just being off
having spent quite a fair bit of time backpacking around asia those were the times i felt at home and i made so many friends right now because of the pandemic travel is restricted the people i met and the experiences i had shaped me real differently from the people in my country
we have decided to be friends but i am still hoping he comes back the current situation is that we are in the same friend groupdiscord so we have interacted there but have not talked 1 on 1 since the breakup
then came the anger and resentment for themhealing has not come easy to me i find myself still mad at you sometimes
the thought itself is much more disjointed and chaotic but you get the picture yeahmy life is like a fly dropping in turbulence
last year she worked at this office and had this coworker at the time who seemed like a loner at first but then they really connected over mutual interests
after we broke up so many things happened so many things changed but for some reason i thought we would never change
i recently broke up with my boyfriend because i was struggling with mental health i feel bad because he was hurt by it he is so hurt and it is my fault
i look at it in its literal meaning but i also think of it as if i play both parts of romeo and juliet
last summer i lost my anti depressants and was very vulnerable and lonely during this time i met a girl on interpals
we hope this time brings you much love laughter and gratitude as we are drawing closer to the end of this year
but now i struggle to find someone who i even have passing commonalities with i have met girls that find me interesting but i rarely find them that in return
i am hoping one day i will wake up and it will not bother me and part of me knows that that day will come
the last person i was talking to did not like that i was experiencing rolling blackouts and that my phone died so i could not text them
so of you read this i am sorry and i hope you are not having as hard as a time as i am
nevertheless if you are ever to read this just know that i miss you beyond measure there is no sense in forcing the pithy phrases out
after this i told him i was coming from my friends birthday party downtown and he got pissed why in the hell are you really over here and the 2 years i spent with you were hell
completely ghosted me that night she spoke to me again after i called her grandmother with whom i had an excellent relationship
i do not know what to think about that i mean as i tell it it does not sound like there was a sexual intention there but i do not know i have been thinking about it for the past few days and i do not feel good at all because it is something really concerning
i am ranting about this most recent fight but many similar fights happen where i feel like she does not give a shit what i am saying
i am physically disabled as well which is what started me down this spiral tonight when i am in a lot of physical pain my mental health deteriorates
he was constantly over at my apartment for about 4 weeks like 4 almost five days out of the week my roommates said to chill 3 days max because they want their space i agreed because it was not horrible and he threw a fit and was telling me they are jealous bitches i have limited time etc i rolled my eyes because who cares
i put a tldr at the end and another paragraph trying to explain exactly what i am currently dealing with so if you do not want to read this whole thing please read the last two paragraphs
basically everyday i think of dying and killing myself at some point in the day the answer seems obvious but i still think that i am faking it to make excuses just to be lazy
it is been more than a week that i can not study my lessons i procrastinate do something else and just do not get back to studying i feel so exhausted i have pain all over my muscles and bones have loss of appetite and do not mind if i skip my meals i know i am being lazy although i do not want to
i want to take shrooms but i know i will get false hope and will convince myself maybe one day i can be a woman but i know biology is not in my favor
or was i happy i am not sure anymore my thoughts were awesome let me walk out of the window to celebrate that yaaaaaaaaay
i was so happy with you i loved you so much and you loved me too things were amazing but then something changed you changed
she is a nice girl and very cute but there are red flags for instance she got way too attached to me too quickly
it has been and always will be my fault and they even say how much i am at fault what about them i am shut down and do not want to talk with anyone
i feel desperate for girls attention and although i look much better dress better i always make sure i look smell good bought a few suits and niche fragrances some good designer ones this became one of my passions i feel like invisible to other girls
since then he is bought a house i find it strange since i know he does not have the cash for a down payment kind of hope he did not get into anything shady and now found out he is going to mexico with this new girl to spend time with his dad and girlfriend
i really want to cancel my appointment with my psychiatrist now but i know it might not be a good idea so now i am here
all i wanted was to be there with him along with his online friends but it was more a easy them way over me and it just makes me feel like really i was jelly at first because i felt he was just going to block me out and hang with them so i was kind of bugging now it really that
but at the same time i am single and if i would not have any friends i would be very lonely and unfortunately i have the feeling that if i were in a relationship i would immediately drop all my friends
i broke up with him start of quarantine had a rebound against my better judgement then got back together for a few months during the summer only to break up with him again the day after my birthday
2 weeks before we officially ended it i broke up with him but we decided on getting back together and work on things but if i decide to break up with him again that it would be final and no going back
they feel so real and i think wait she is alive when i go to look for her she is not there
i know that i do not want my life to end i want my pain to end but it feels like there is only one way out of this mess at this point
every time i text him and say i love him he tells me he loves me too when i tell him i miss him he tells me he misses me too
i still do not know why it did not work especially since i never sought out any medical help i knew it would hurt and it did but i still do not regret trying
but i was able to realize that i needed to understand where on that aromantic spectum i probably rested more often than not
then he texted again two hours later i want to say i miss you too but i do not feel right saying it i feel weird we are in our 20s i just did not know how to respond to that
i mean with lockdown measures and other coronavirus limitations it was hard to do anything to begin with however when it came to work and school i did not really try and was living passively and was depressed
i have noticed how unlikable annoying narcissistic i am i am struggling with extreme loneliness and unexplainable emotions i have felt for years
a few would be fine i feel like i am a pretty great friend but for some reason i always get taken for granted by my friends i am so reliable for them i wish they were there for me call me on the phone and check up on me meet for coffee etc
i have to constantly bring it up for people to even acknowledge that my birthday is coming up and even then people just shrug it off as if i do not matter
i hate walking by him and the silence we would hug each other and kiss now he walks by me and sometimes there is a smart comment and i curse at him in spanish of course he do not know what i am saying though i loved him though i hope it was worth leaving me if it made you happier
if i was going to stay then at least it would be for more money and other things we stayed like that for another 2 years when a guy finally came and helped us with work
the day i confronted you about everything was the day i realized that being friends with you hurts so damn much
i gave my everything held it together when she could not i was there for her when she was not there for herself i was ready to do anything she asked for
i do not want to die alone nor do i want to live feeling like almost everyone i value just up and leaves
i reach out to people all the time and sometimes they reply and sometimes they do not even if they do they stop responding after their first message to me
i am just sharing here bc i really do not have anyone to talk to about thiswhy has the narcissistic ex crossed the road they thought it was a boundary
i am a 52 male so people usually do not take me very seriously whenever they can mock me so this has resulted in me getting charged for assault numerous times
i fell behind on my work in class but with her beside me i actually tried i wish i could i would taken her to school with me
i did not want to make a post here but i need to get out of my head right now i am 21 years old and i feel absolutely lost about my life right now
most of my friends have left or do not want to talk to me anymore the only time i spend tome with people my age 20 i know they do not want me there
cbt is often used by therapists to help people suffering from low confidence because lack of confidence can lead to other mental health issues such as anxiety and low mood
so i have a really burning urge to call her she wanted no contact and i have tried to respect it but its so hard today any advice
in this coronavirus period we got more lonely than before this led some people to think what so happened in their life so far
i lost full motivation on the things i found interestingand i like it until hes adjusted the lvl to player like me to hell
so i do not give a fuck again i am awake a couple days again do not eat a couple days again can not await the moment when i go to sleep forever and finally get some rest
even though having supportive friends i have reached to the point that nothing makes me genuinely happy was told that i would experience joy and happiness through helping others but all i felt were emptiness and sometimes sadness
but thinking about it helps but do not act on it this part of your life is over and probably for the better
i need to wait until i get tired enough to instantly fall asleep when i close my eyes the alternative is too painful
as i say frequently there is not only one person for us but many so it is useless to disavow all our past relationships because they are a part of who you are
i have been super lost and sad lately i do not know my purpose in life and i just feel so lonely some days it is super hard to get up i do not know if it is just a quarter life crisis but i sure hope i will get over this hump
i was angry willing to do 25 years to life for beating the bastard in more ways than most can imagine
i just can not take it anymore maybe i should just make his wish come truewhat is the point life is so pointless and stupid why are we here
i want to keep trying to fight for her and i think that is the right thing to do but how do i do that
on top of that i keep waking up at least once in the night sometimes only after 2 hours of sleep my only saving grace is i can go right back to sleep but it is one more unpleasant thing i have to deal with
we had a rough and rocky end of 2019 due to my job requiring a lot of my time and had issues prioritizing her correctly and she almost broke it up with me but i fought hard to keep our relationship on track this was november 2019
at first i thought it was caused she was not used to college but as the weeks went on i realized it was that she just did not care to put the effort in
i have had a couple before but this is the first time i have bought one myself and signed up to pay for the plan myself
to help you avoid this uncomfortable experience i have compiled 3 of the most frequent excuses people make to break nocontact and an explanation next to each on why you should not follow their lead
having failed in the only thing i was good at my depression got worse and at the same time the feeling of being cast away from others
he had a girlfriend for 6 months but he told me he never loved her and never told her he loved her
being considered in your social circle and feeling genuinely happy this is so toxic and my relationship was not like this and my ex friend is just completely insane
work on my mental health enjoy things this life is a living hell i want the pain and sorrow to end
he said i do not do anything i took a shower calmed down and cleaned the house i am still as miserable as always
they barely turned me and had no concern for if i had an audiobook or tv or anything to at least distract my mind from the horrifying situation i am a 21 year old girl
he answers really vaguely about a mental health deseas not giving the medical term and telling a friend of him died of the same thing cus of some medication he is been given and which tim ofc is refusing to take
we broke up 15 years back i know she had a guy on the back burner while we broke up she initiated the break up i did not speak to her after that
i am lonely i have my dogs i miss my ex just to have someone who kind of understood me but he obviously did not enough gods i miss the sex i miss the intimacy most i miss being held and kissed and cuddled and looked at and told everything was going to be okay
i even suggested he suffers from a mental illness but refuses to go to a therapist anyway i never talked to this guy again after a couple of days
my brother is 28 now can not go anywhere and has no interest in studying for his exams he says he does not care about his life anymore
in the netherlands we got this holiday called kingsday and 23 weeks after the amy drama i ran into him at a festival he was there together with harry my best friend which is also his best friend and another girl this time it was not amy but lisa and here is where the story really begins guys
while i did choose to break up with my ex does not mean i am not hurting too i genuinely lost my best friend and it hurts like crazy
i know i have major issues and been working on them just started taking lexapro to help with the stress and anxiety depression all while beginning menopause
my m20 ex f19 broke up with me 5 days short of 3 months ago after 3 years and 7 months of being together
i wish i could just reminisce and be happy that my childhood was good but it just feels only sad because that part of my life is gone forever and my parents will be gone eventually too and it is hard to take comfort in the time i have with them now when i keep thinking about this
i am done i am a total hypochondriac and now i am thinking the worst that i fried my internal organs by accident literally they said it is a low voltage and my vitals are okay
almost like it is mundane and could very easily be the next thing i do so again please do not kill youself i wish we could communicate but i guess that was the downfall
an example of my behavior is this let us say i am going to a big party later in the week and i am excited but a couple days before the party it gets cancelled
with everything that he said to me the things that happened i can not even imagine being friends with him the way we used to me
i made a promise to myself that on monday if i do not feel better i am going to end it all by hanging myself using my headphone cables
i sometimes regret talking to people i like spending time with myself this is not spontaneous this has been this way for a long time
i understand she does not need me in her life but i need her i have nothing to offer her which her friends can not
my exs roommates are in town though we became friends during the relationship and we are still on really good terms
so today i decided that i would sell the ring i in language courses before i started school i met a guy and we started to be a couple
whether i spend the whole day playing a video game reading a book writing learning a language studying learning something new working at my job whatever i just feel like i am wasting my time and that it is all pointless
it does not even matter in what capacity but i just need him in my lifeafter 6 months of struggling i have finally managed to get myself back on two feet
i do not check up on you anymore and you do not exist for me this is my last post for you i did not mourn the loss of you but the death of my love my heart which you crushed by your feet
i might be weird too but i much rather slightly rude people than the ones that act too nice like they want something or idk something is goin on and i can not figure out what
i am sure they all see me know for the piece of shit alcoholic loser i really am anyway sorry for the short novel
my gf broke up with me because she said she not ready for a relationship and feels guilty because i see a future but she does not
i am tired of trying to change myself so that i can fit into a world that seems to go out of its way to reject me
i could go around i give you some strong words like never trust completely or your mistake is giving your all
it was a deep love to where it makes you think our souls will always be intertwined or stanley tourrentine honestly i just love jazz
i told you how i felt while you told me nothing i should hate you and be upset with you but i can not it is not who i am
when did mental health issues become acceptable or not so taboo what was it like for people suffering from mental health issues in the 90s or the 80s
i feel disgusted with myself the way i feelhuman beings exist only in relation to one another no man is an island
i made a previous post about how i would commit if i had a gun but i have just had it everyone is an asshole to me everybody always leaves me on read and not to mention this dumbass virus
i keep trying to communicate and relate with other people but i just keep getting it wrong being around other people is so damned hard but then when i am alone i wish i had someone to talk to
i used to have a small group of friends but i drifted apart over the years many moved away others turned to drugs
stabbing myself in the neck is going to be hard but because i live in canada there is no guns at my home and no other methods are easy access all i want to do is jump off a high rooftop or cliff but of course i can not easily get to one maybe ill cut my arms but that is going to be really hard too
i do not know if it helps me at all and if they would even be watchable if someone stumbled upon it but as a woman with autism who just lost her relationship i had to do something to shake my daily life up a bit i guess is it against the rules to post the link to it here is anyone even interested to take a look
i keep overthinking everything even what clothes i am going to wear to go out and this always ends up in me not doing the thing i am overthinking about
i just want to die i regret everything and i am worthless i get made fun of for my autism all the time i know i am inferior but should not i get treated like everyone else i wonder if i should just make it easier for everyone and just off myself or is my body not worth cleaning off the pavement sorry if this was heavy also very sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this kind of thing please tell me if so again sorry
i feel lonely and like i am in a world of nothing it is like i am cracking open slowly i have had this before but it is so much harder when you know it can be fixed
i have had friend groups i have loved and been loved so i would like to believe after that conversation he said that he could easily sue me but he will not do that
i made him laugh i was his only friend i was with him no matter what it did not matter what he did to me
his family are amazing and love me for who i am but it is not the same hope people understand what i am trying to say
then 2020 hit first corona news and i started to go less and less to schcool well then depression and first dissociations hit and i could not even go up at some point from bed anymore and missed every exam
and i hate that he is so happy and fine about all of this while i feel all of this i was also actually okay until one day he drunk texted me that he misses me sometimes
i was diagnosed with bpd and ocd years ago and depressionanxiety as symptoms of these but that is it my life is pointless i wish things were different
i have good grades at school but i study everything last minute and somehow pull as and bs i am not talkative and hate socializing but i wish i had genuine friends
yet it sucks to have moments like now where i feel pain they say id rather feel pain than nothing but id rather feel nothing the pain
my heart dropped and my dad came up to me and said to just stick by his side and not say a word
000httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat0s hello to fellas clinical psychologist dr iakovina koutoufa 034httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat34s home is where there is joy but also comments about my eating
me and my wifehad a severe miscommunication and i ended up texting someone about stuff and i should not have i hate myself acting before clarifying but i hate hurting my wife
the city they moved is not even a permanent move for them they are just testing out the waters so his life is very up in the air right now
i drank heavily to quiet my mind but started having these violently intrussive thoughts about hurting myself in many creative ways which i have not done in a while
you see it would be nice to talk to him about it but because of how completely random it would be i am really not sure and i am kind of just waiting for an opportunity when we are alone and the mood feels right if you know what i mean
i have a severe phobia of vomiting emetophobia that results in ocdlike compulsions plus i am generally afraid of needles hospitals heights abandonment and a handful of other things
i am afraid of what is to come after death i am afraid of leaving the people i love behind which are very few people now
so now i am struggling because i am trying to move on even though i know he is a good person who i loved spending time with
i used to flaunt about my ability to be alone and that i needed nobody now i am starting to realize that was only my way of survival because my family had neglected me my entire life in that i think it might be time for me to admit i like people and want people in my life this might not be for here and again i am sorry
this might be an uncommon statement on this sub but i had a good childhoodhi a friend of mine i struggling with anxiety and panic attacks including hyperventilating
a new chapter in my boring so far life has started and hopefully a better one i am in a complete new environment
and all of that because you actually trusted them with your pure heart that they will not play with it and boom they destroy the hell out of it
the causes of loneliness are varied and include social mental emotional and physical factors the last real one i am dealing with internet addiction and time management
although i know she needs motivation to go out i know it will make her feel much shittier if i will make her fill guilty about not studying
it is now been 5 months since me and my wife divorced that was the second time my heart was shattered the second woman to cheat on me i have had 2 relationships so far and both ended this way and since then i have been completely alone i hate this damn virus for making this shit year even worse how am i supposed to go out hook up and have fun with all the restrictions going on
if alive i will move somewhere noone knows me and try and start again try and make it so people care about me even if i will never have a relationship
i feel like social medias are taking more and more of our interaction and if you are a nobody you may disappear in this digital world
we have not met up since but have text a couple times a week for 2 months now mostly led by me she is reached out only a handful of times
i recently found out my wife started talking to another guy and now wants a divorce she left me right after i bought a turkey for us the other day now i am all alone in the house we have created so many memories in
like today i started the day as positively as i could i ate breakfast meditated organized my work bag and then
she even talked to me more than she spoke with her friends because she trusted me so much she never lied to me or cheated on me or even hung out with people behind my back
she told me when we got back that she is been cheating on me for weeks with a 59 year old guy
i know the person my friend is and that he would never do anything like that but he brought it up again today and said he can not wrap his head around why i would think he was such a terrible person
almost exactly two months later i sit alone most of the time i still sit at the same desk and sometimes instinctively look up to where you used to sit my eyes momentarily scatter to meet yours but you are not there anymore and in that moment my small studio feels like the biggest room in the world and i am alone
comsocialisolation to be able to understand it better but i am still at loss at what to do because i feel so rejected and unwanted
i was so empty before meeting her i replay all the videos we made together replay all the voice messages of her saying she loves me
i just want someone to appreciate me for who i really am to love me for who i am weird but okay i did that no problem
i am really depressed right now and i do not feel like i have anyone to talk to i feel the lowest i have ever been in my life and i am really scared i am going to do something dumb
no one cares honestly should not have reached out to make friends just gave me false hopes_so just for clearance 1 i am not diagnosed yet and
hi if you are like me and talking about your problems with others does not help or you do not like people too much you can use a notebook everytime i have negative thoughts i write those here it helps a lot maybe it can work for you c
i have friends and family i have people i can talk to but i still feel lonely does not matter how many people are around me does not matter what they say nothing matters i feel so empty that feeling never fades away it is always with me like i am prisoner of my mind and i am alone in that cage forever
sorry for the long post i just want to rant and ask how to go through this it is beginning to feel like that time will never come
all while professing love and commitment and apologizing it happened so gradually i did not realize i envy mixed people for this reason
my mom berates me for being lazy and fat and not having friends but god she did not care when i told her i would tried to kill myself she was only upset at the fact that i would been angry with her
most of the time when i do show empathy or caring for others i am fully aware of it not being real every time i feel like it is an illusion of me being nice and not long after i would find my actions of kindness unnecessary and fake
i was broken up with by who i thought was the love of my life and it took me so long to recover
i am scared to die but it feels like the only answer right now i am writing this from a good place and it feels so foreign to me
i am tired of feeling sad i want to feel warmth again but i do not want to commit to someone in fear of the same thing happening
they were the only 2 people i had in my life i miss them i wish i could tell them how much i regret doing what i did and how much i miss them and want them back to my life
i was heartbroken for him and asked him how he knows only to realize he had no evidence of this but rather started seeing a pattern and is now 100 sure she is cheating on him
my boyfriend said i was panicking in my sleep i vaguely remember being woken up by the sound of my own voice yelling
i was genuinely happy i felt like my depression went away for good i felt normal the school was not pressuring me anymore the school was the problem i figured it out
i really want to get out of this mess but i do not know how i can not get a therapist so this is the second option
it is like i forget it is not real and i will even have an outburst of anger and throw something or start beating the air
so i want to know aita for not wanting to go to my moms house because it makes me incredibly anxious and uncomfortable
you are better than the dream i had i wanted to live and breathe healing after the pain it was our only choice
i can not be with people over a long time in general even if it is someone i am really close to like family
one weekend after she refused to come see me we were not speaking with each other i got really hammered and called her only to find out she blocked me everywhere
i may be the loneliest person on earth no doubt we all feel that way from time to time i offered ideas and solutions to reconnecting
humans are emotional beings i am very emotional and it shows sometimes is part of my personality its fine while i am busy but as soon as i am alone i miss her
i might have all of the principles of a good person who is ready to always react and help meaning that many things in life are more complex and harder for me by default and it is my own fault
he started getting annoyed when i just said i wanted to be on the phone a bit longer and said we have talked for longer than he wanted and that he is busy and needs to go do stuff for work and has nothing else to say
i hate myself more than ever for being a dumbass and i will never change myself for the better i just want to die and feel a sense of eternal peace and belonging
i would think b l a c k market but i would rather help like some kid who has their whole life ahead of them or a parent who would love a few more years with their fam or a cancer patient etc
making this on a new account so my boyfriend does not see it and start worrying again i just can not deal with that right now and he deserves to enjoy his trip to see his family
its even lonelier than i thought it could be i usually take it day by day but somedays the smallest things break me
my boyfriend really needs to move on from me i am going to be a literal dead end i can not give him a family i can not give him anything at all he is probably just using me for sex and lying when he says he cares about me because i am freaking deformed i just want to rip my own freaking head off
i also grew really close to someone who often came to my house for dinner and movies like nobody could pull me out of it but myself
get over it while you can and move on with your lives instead of letting yourself get dragged down into the pit that surrounds me
i do not want to do the things that you are obligated to do within this world and the things that people often lean on when faced with this dilemma are not present within me
its truth haunted me i have watched two good friends lose their parents now and i do not look forward to that inevitable pain
i am so tired and i honestly can not take it but i am too scared to end it myself been unemployed for a minute and i am just tired of being useless i can not get the motivation to work like i used to and even without a job i find myself exhausted at the end of the day it is a lose lose life
i do not feel like any more needs to be said cuz if i start sharing details about my personal life you fuckers are going to be all you have x and y reason to live cuz ______ i do not want to hear it
why did you even start this yes this relationship that broke your heart and shattered your soulbecause of love remember that is not an easy word to understand
even the person i live with or the friends i am around all the time do not know especially lately that it is been worse
he was my best friend and now i just feel completely emptyi corent with my sister who also has mental health needs
i am still in the same hole of sadness and anxiety but maybe this could help someone out there i have tried to rationalize it or stop myself like i am overthinking it but i just keep wrapping back around
seems like she was in the photo she showed me but under the sheets of the bed i can not see the photo anymore maybe it was evident but i think it was obvious that i wanted more that i was starting to feel a little more and when she showed me that photo i analyzed it for a while
i also have hobbies like programming 3d modelling and drawing but i am always scared that i am bad and also do not know how to approach anyone
hey i finally cleaned my messy depression room after months my anxiety got worse during quarantine i am anxious about many things
communicative emotionally intellectual exhumes chivalry respectful of my boundaries and boasts wonderful character values his handsomeness is a sweet little bonus too
lastly get perspective on your problems by reflecting on how minuscule they are compared to everything else going around in the world
i wish i could end everything right now but i am afraid of suicide even more pathetic so i have no other choice
i have been in their position before so i completely empathize with what they are going through i also know that what kept me going will not work for them i want to take them to see a professional but i do not want to be the reason they do not achieve the one thing they were working towards for so long
when i looked at myself and saw my sunken in face and saw that the skinny jeans that where always a little too tight on me where now falling off i became extremely concerned for my health
my family was rather dysfunctional and i did not have proper support systems i am whole on my own i started picturing myself doing mundane things blissfully and alone
i was so excited as i thought we were finally getting somewhere and maybe i would finally be getting answers and a therapists for my problems
for the past couple of years i have been dealing with depression and anxiety this year with the covid pandemic has been worse for my mental health
we got together earlier this year but before then i was single for almost 4 years with no friends he is had his heart broken
how do i accept my best friend will never be my best friend again how do i accept this realization anyone have experience with this we dated for two years but have known eachother for 7
i still resent and still can not accept the fact that he is the one who breeze through easy life work a dream job live in a beautiful country surrounded by warm friends and families all in all living his dreams and on top of it now he is with beautiful woman who is very in line with his interest
either way you have to get it out of your mind out of your head and onto paper or into your phone
which i now totally respect because i was not providing that for her because i was trying to also take care of myself
another problem in regards to this is that i am not vocal about how i really feel hope everyone is way better than me and that you guys had a great day
i do not want them to so i try to fight but i am too kind or just emotional to wage any wars
since my dad flew back and forth to visit my grandpa i stayed to help my mom at the pizza shop long hours on school nights
after that i had somewhat of a revelation that my life sucks so for the past year i actively tried to make friends and to sum it up i did not make a noticable improvement
the realization that she was no longer mine that i can not reach out to her anymore and how mistreated she had made me feel
that is another one of the many reasons i really thought she was the one while i think she understood me so much i now think i did not understand her just as much
i have had people telling me this repeatedly and i am so fucking tired of it it gets better or this will pass no it will fucking not it never does
i am enough for me and yet i am not i am a 17 year old male and tomorrow my relationship of almost a year is going to be ending
because of this and also other feelings accumulated i am never happy since many years with higher selfesteem you can also givereceive more love and engage in deeper intimacy in general
but i at least wanted to know that the person i was always there for did not leave me to die alone
i know this is not true though she did not want to work on the relationship and she tried to sabotage it again and again
everyday is the same i feel out of control with my emotions part of the outlet for these rage fantasies was my sister
i was just light headed for a while anytime i choke myself i also want that but how hard i try i can not do it not again
i am writing this with tears in my eyes and no hope in my heart no one believes me an the ones who do do not think it is that bad i am f19 and have a brother who is 16 despite she age difference he is huge super tall and strong whilst i did not grow that much and i am below average and chubby
i received nothing i wanted i received everything i needed broke up in september 2020 after 2 years together we started interacting less and did not speak much
hugging stuffed animals i wished were you crying because i was so damn worried about you idk what to do anymore i want to end it tonight in all honesty
eventually one day i came home and he was calm and seemed to be getting along with my mother everything seemed fake and forced but i was so burnt out i did not care anymore i said as long as they are both safe i can take care of my life
there are moments in our lives when we feel like that due to various situations for me it was breaking up with a gf ltr but i know there are things that hurt so much more those moments may be days or even years long and it is specially difficult meeting new people during lockdowns
for context i stay with my parents and my family is nice i sleep in my own roomam only good at existentialist poetry would prefer flesh people but i ended up searching rloneliness did not i
i feel that the society and culture that i am living in now do not suit me and it makes it even harder to find a partner as i have no intentions of following what everyone is rushing to do
that i would never change the things i was doing to make her feel that way and she was tired and exhausted from waiting for me to change
but i guess it still hurts as much as a healthy relationship would hurt because as fucked up as some things sound things were also fine
i was out of the country that week but she called me to tell me she was terrified of the idea and had been avoiding him because they were coworkers they were friends and their crazy boss sorta had a thing for her the boss was a bully and she did not want the boss targeting him because of her
i recently told a good friend to break up with their toxic gf as i felt the relationship was hurting both of them
i wrote here many many months ago talking about how i could get by daily but how i am still incredibly lonely
i have no place anywhere and i might kill myself just to spare myself the fucking guilt of stealing the opportunities of those in my life simply by associating with me
i still have dreams of him and they are always so hostile last night in my dream i fought him and his new gf who was his ex before me lol and i was so mean i did not win btw beyonce and ariana grande had to escort me out of the costco we were in
i blew through over 10k i had saved up since i have been out of work because of how bad my depression is
been having the urge to stalk him on instagram to see what is he is been up to but i have been begging myself not to
later that night i got really sad just thinking about all that because i have never experienced that level of intimacy with someone
my job alone can not support my sister and i can not it even support myself and i have no skills or education for anything better than fast food i am 29 and have felt like dying for years and i am just so tired and i want it all to be over
she came through with a 100 and some dog food ad i was worried about keeping my pup fed i was able ti get my phone back on and saw family reaching out
it will haunt them for their life whether they realize it or not and add more delusion to their lifes practices and purposes
i asked him if we could finish season one of ahs together as he promised and he refused i told him i hated him and blocked him
i did not have the balls to confess it to my girlfriend and i went on a solotrip without telling my girlfriend
i do not know why i am even writing this i read that this sub has helped a lot of people for a while i admit i myself overdid it
he is balding and getting a gut he is always getting texts from females 247 they usually only want however now it is over i feel so sad guilty and can only remember the amazing times we had
the challenge comes when the mind is overstimulated overactive and is constantly processing potential dangers and trying to learn from things in the past
every moment of it felt like we had fallen in love all over again and it seemed as if all of our troubles had been forgotten
my mums side of the family are all in thailand and she is not close with her mother due to personal reasons
i am always stuck in my head i zone out and i miss what people say to me i am constantly overthinking everything from the smallest things to the biggest problems
i even got rejected and heartbroken again on the twomonth anniversary of the car accident which happened to be christmas eve that nearly killed me and it honestly shattered me
my entire life has always been so defined by fear and i am so tired i have had generalized anxiety for my whole life and am generally kind of a fearful person
there are probably many other little things that happened within the course of 7 months but eventually everything endedi do understand and i am trying to change that
still i press on trying to keep my positive attitude but lately i can not shake this sad feeling inside i feel trapped in this loop that i cannot escape
first find a spot to perform this exercise it can be anywhere as long as somewhere you will not be disturbed by outside forces
i wanted to do everything with him i just wanted to make him happy honestly just give him the whole world
1 i was wrong yo ask you not to talk to that guy of you want to talk to anyone else it really should matter to me dating or not i trust in your judgment and choice
going to try and hang myself while drinking the bathroom cleaning acid or whatever that shit is called and try and slit my wrist
i get super attached and never want to lose whomever no matter how shit they are my first real relationship i was 1516 and were together for 7 months
apologies this will probably be a long one to be honest i do not even know why i am writing this people who sell or buy are seen with a stigma probably all over the world sex touches our feelings
still in the early stages of considering any of this but it is in my mind advice experience thanksyou have to tear everything apart and put it all back together now huh but how
just when you thought you would be enjoying your first second third holiday season with your significant other who you were convinced was with you for the long haul now suddenly they are gone
i also plan to take 8 x 10mg of cetirizine as i read that it has antiemetic properties and can because drowsiness
i am writing this to encourage everyone to reach out to people who would have thought that one of my greatest friends in life would be a grumpy old man who is 60 years older than me and who was a ceo of a fancy company
and to add to that i broke up with my girlfriend because she did not like me being overprotective about the fact that i do not like her smoking and that she could die due to lung cancer
i have been struggling with anxiety and depression my whole life just restarted therapy and an ssrifrankly i do not want to live in a world plagued by the sadistic broken darkness of the human soul
i do not know when i lost feelings but i did atleast when that one ended i understood what was happening but with this breakup i am so confused
i felt tremendously guilty for it i did not know what to do or how to end things in the least painful way possible for her the fact that she is a really nice person made everything even worse and that was when covid and the quarantine came in
quick backstory i have generally had below average self esteem since some point in high school and was chronically lonely for years
life is an experiment just some are better at it with luck of a career partner and interests i wish i at least had the third
i am going to it is always better to be kind but it is hard work maybe that is it then why are people lazy prcks path of least resistance maybe
i am choosing christmas as a final fuck you yo my shitty family this will probly be my last post because i am better off dead anyways so bye
she is a fucking adult and if she can not be bothered to try and change get help make changes in her life and be grateful that is not my fault she can fuck off i do not care
so yea to put it simply i am somewhat alone friendwiseso my dad have always had a bad temper but nowadays the reason for it is getting stupid
maybe i am looking into it tooo deep but i just wanted someone elses opinion on what this means am i over him or something
i have a roommate and i have friends but i do not feel particularly comfortable leaning on any of them and my roommate is gone most nights anyways
first i do not know if this is the correct sub if not feel free to delete this post i just need to get it off my chest somewhere
the other girl is a known unreliable source of info and lies a lot so i do not know what is true and what is not on the other hand my ex is brutally honest
this exercises whole premise is to help you understand how small you arewhich is a good thing and how insignificant the heartbreak you are going through truly is compared to the grand scheme of things
i am scared of forming new connections or making friends because i felt almost everyone i knew except my family has interacted with me because of their own benefits
how fucking naive now i am just bidding my time until my parents die so i can follow them them the fuck out
like after civil i would do march and then get into the gaming industry that seemed to motivate me for a while
i am fucking depressed and you guys have the fucking nerve to sit in my face and try to comfort me and tell me i am making progress i am endlessly grateful for my boyfriend because he has been there when you all have not when you all turned against me he was there
they spam their phone while blocked they profess their love while never hearing the same words back and they apologize when there is no need for apologies ultimately they prolong their recovery which could be accelerated if they just knew their worth
during covid she said she felt like quarantine brought us closer together than ever back in june she moved to start a graduate program
she would cry and beg me not to go and then flip flop and tell me i need to leave her alone and it is over
i do not sleep a lot because of this and i think the sleeplessness is definitely contributing negatively to this but i currently have christmas holiday so i get to wake up late technically getting enough sleep just that i fall asleep like 5 in the morning and wake up 1300 and it has not gone better you all got any idea what this is about
for example imagine everything from positive things like first kisses childbirth new inventions discoveries art pieces to atrocities like robberies murders wars childrens abduction fresh affairs new separations and ughtraffic jams
it is only been a week since that appointment but i have not felt this free for as long as i can remember this christmas was the first one that i have not cried or felt down and hopeless
never have i ever been anyones first thought i am always the backup i am always the one that people only invite since they feel bad or i have to ask to join as they make plans right in front of me
i know it takes time but just how do you manage to survive until you feel better it is only been a week and i do not think i have the strength to keep going like this any longer would therapy and maybe antidepressants help
she was able to tear down years and years worth of self esteem issues and insecurities and really pump positivity into my life
she was very neglecting of my boundaries and emotions i am tired of this but i just can not get over her i do not know what to do
when i explain my pain to the doctors no new information is given no new instruction is given pain can worsen medication remains the same currently in december 2020 i have no test planned and am still 3 years undiagnosed and not even classified as chronic pain
i feel confused and rejected and i am not sure what to do with myself apparently while i was away she posted some art that clearly was about me and it said i am sorry as her entire life is being a artist
my aunt has bipolar disorder so it sort of runs in the family but not a strong correlation ah how i would love to finally feel some connection and have someone that i can rely on
because soulmates require patience life moulds each of us to what or who we will be and will not introduce you to the person you should spend the rest of your life with not until you are ready
i am always pissed off lately and it is exhausting to be angry and to push it down i just want to stop existing
i guess it worries me sometimes how comfortable i have become with that notion i have spent my life caring about everyone else with little to no care and concern reciprocated
i would love to learn more about this experience and how you were able to improve your condition in a healthy way that did not need distractions
by god i would rather die the slowest and painfulest death ever imaginable and go to the last circle of hell for the rest of all the eternities than to try to have a planck timelasting relationship with somebody from my world again
i have hurt so many people that i have cared about i treated them so bad and i have unknowingly manipulated and ruined them i never meant to hurt them so bad i was just so blinded by my selfishness
and yes i have tried tinder grindr zoosk okaycupid etc could be events could be a moment an interaction could be the way they treated you
i recently discovered the dynamics between me anxious preoccupied f30 and her being a fearful avoidant f22 and right now i feel so depressed after the breakup
we had a lot of good times hanging out and even travelled to far away provinces she introduced me to her cousins and colleauges that we are official
sir you have this and this already swung the hammer this and this is needed another swing of the hammer at what is a very delicate vast richly textured and layered thing persons thinking processes
so i am going to start this by saying that i have lived with at least two narcissistic parents throughout my early childhood
to add to this my buddy from home texted me last night saying his girlfriend had just broken up with him as well
i keep experiencing the same feeling you get when a person says they are experiencing deja vu but it is almost like a flash of a life experience i have not experienced yet all of these life experiences are of me getting into bad car crashes is this possibly just a subconscious fear i am having
we only had one argument over the entire relationship and besides that we were great togethernot just any random person if some random person started talking about their ex it would not really bother me
my time right now is limited and i need to prepare for the worst and i am really not sure what worst looks like anymore so
i am aware that there is a great deal of people that care about me but still the thoughts if using the money to finance my preferred method of suicide is still on my mind constantly as well as the guilt of thinking towards that
started university 2016 and finally failed after 2 years of depressed procrastination 2018 i started a dual university programm march 2020 i finally failed this too
that was what gave me optimism about the future later that night i was playing a game with friends when it finally hit me
i am not even struggling or sad or anything just so empty he looked like he was so in love with me the way he looked at me was eye catching
a white heart from hyperdimension neptunia franchise i have no one to talk to and i do not even connect with others anymore
do you love me or not i know we can not be together because of your parents but i would still like to know
my friends probably do not give a shit about my well being and i am the most unimportant person to all of my friends they would not even notice if i am dead let alone bother
i can not stop thinking about what would have happened if the police had actually gone to their house to the point where i am starting to obsess over it
we do not know what to do he will not accept treatment or even acknowledge something is wrong please help me help my parents what is our first step
i see myself in the mirror now brow furrowed if i lean close i will see what i do not want to know tension sadness disappointment my blue eyes dulled cheeks flushed with capillaries that look like rivers on maps hair lying like snakes

i know they spent quite some money on tutoring for me to get here and i am so grateful for that and that is why i made sure to get the most of it and put it to good use by succeeding in getting into this college but now i feel burnt out
i am struggling so much i have ran out of tears i am hurting my parents but i can not even begin to explain my issues to them so i begin shouting
i have no one to reach out to no one cares about me why the fuck was i allowed to have children they deserve so much better i hate myself
i was just scanning through this group and saw tons of posts about self hate do not get me wrong i do not like myself but my looks are not the problem i am an introvert and i am shy so who cares i have nothing to loose i might as well say my peace because being quiet never got me anywhere sigh easier said than done
all the dudes in my life rn just want sex from me rn but i still can not seem to heal from things that happened to me so long ago
they set my bear up to look like it shot itself with a toy gun complete with a suicide note stuffing falling out of a hole in its face

i just want to be happy and not have to pretend anymore that i am okay when i am not it is free and has no ads i have been using it to keep my teenager motivated during difficult times
she is such an amazing person and i do not want to lose her but sadly that is not my choice to make
why well because you are and now this is all on you and i so know karmai would really appreciate any words of wisdomadvice
i want to disappear from everything every single day there is something that piles onto my stress and anxiety it is like a running gag i put in so much fucking effort to not completely shut down and it is draining me there are so many things that i have little to no control over and the universe just expects me to stay strong be present and work my way through it i am trying
eventually i will get over her and not feel sad when i think about her eventually i will find someone else who will appreciate all of the love that i have to give
i was getting something warm to wear and i stumbled upon the hoodie he gave me it just brought back a lot of memories i do not even know what i am typing at this point it is like 3am here

for the most part of my life i have struggled with school and a ton of easy basic stuff recently i started researching my symptoms and i narrowed down to anxiety or adhd two days ago i was having a late night talk with my mom and she told me that during my childhood many people told her that i probably had adhd she never took me to a therapist i am sorry if this is not the right term english is not my mother tongue because she was scared that it was true and if i got diagnosed maybe i would not be able to have a normal life
i said okay and left the girlfriend is not responding my texts snaps and even unfriended me i hope he has peace
he tells me he hates his life and he said everyone does they tell me that is normal they do not want to be with me
i am poor and i start my holiday shopping in july it is the only way i can make sure everyone gets something
i just have this some sort of instinct that tell me to die like i am maybe curious to die or something
when i got home hours later i hopped straight into the shower and just sobbed uncontrollably forget being optimistic aka false hope
today i spent 30 minutes holding my razor and standing in front of my bathtub sobbing eventually i beat the urge in the dark moments and every time i start to crack i am telling myself it gets better because i really want to believe that it will
i know there is a honeymoon stage but this is a little different when i met him i was new to town and had no idea about his reputation

she make sure she calls me useless all the time all she cares about is school in the country i am currently in guys are enlisted into the military after they finish their education
unfortunately i suffer from a wide range of issues including an eating disorder depression anxiety pornsex addiction and recovery from online child sexual abuse

just be ready if i take my own life one day because i am already so tired of it i walked out of her room grabbed a blade and went and sit on the bathroom floor
i am worried that my message will just push him further away though i do not really understand why if it were me that message would make me sad
i feel like an abused dog curled up in a corner that is trying to bark to be nourished loved and in the instance of my ex gf she just kept kicking me while i am already down
she is an amazing woman and i have always been completely obsessed with her from the very beginningpain affects my mental health it stunts my growth as a person
i want to kiss her when i see her and be intimate but i am scared this will not develop into another relationship
i wish so badly i was never born because truly i do not want to kill myself i just do not want to have existed in the first place but yet i keep googling and trying to find ways to kill myself but i do not have the ways neither the courage to try them
i am scared and something wrong with mei do not even know why i am posting here i do not see how my life can change
i have thought about emotionallymentally manipulating someone i am in love with so he will love me because he has a girlfriend and manipulation is the only viable option i can think of
there does not seem to be a happy ending where i achieve my goals and genuinely love my life what is keeping me from disappearing forever i am too much of a pussy to take my own life but i truly have nothing to live for right now
i am a big hypochondriac and i took a multivitamin pill but it is hard for me to swallow pills so i crushed it i only ended up eating half
i can not stop considering the possibility of going back to him he messaged me saying he changed and that he is ready to treat me how i deserve to be treated part of me thinks that he has it is been 5 months maybe he is finally got his life on track
they always start mid morning and i am not sure if it has to do with sleep deprivation since i now moved into city and loud cars are always passing my window i can safely say this may be linked to it
recognizing that thought is what stopped the action because it took all the joy out of it why even look then i thought part of me said exactly you are not hurting anyone go ahead and please yourself i did not i did not want to i felt i was being invasive for the first time in my life i somehow managed to put myself in the shoes of the individual that was exposed and stopped
edit forgot to mention i also have anxiety even though it got a lot better in the last 2 years i used to not even be able to speak with new people i just stood there frozen in fear of them hating or judging me
i also realized that this 200 laptop had really not been built to have its parts swapped in and out the casing was held in place with clips that were not meant to be opened without permanently breaking them
i have a very strong hatred to this world we live in i wish i was never been born in this unjust cruel world we live

i miss him so much it hurts so bad i feel like its my fault i can not stop crying all my friends told me to end it i did did i make the right choice
i am getting used to being alone again it is been about 2 12 years i have been alone now you kind of forget what love feels like and just sort of exist my life now is has just turned into ways to distract myself to get through the days and not think about the future
i just want to feel safe i live by myself i have no one to help me i know this is going to sound stupid but i was wondering if i should get a gun even with these thoughts i feel like i am to p to kill myself but idk what will happen in the future is there anyone having the same issue as me can you tell me what you decided to do i do not know if this is the right place to post this remove if it is not i am sorry
what are the best ways to keep evolving your mind and brain even after finishing highschool or faculty just really down to the means of being able to do is successfully i guess
i often wonder when will i finally get the courage to kill myself i am very much exhausted and there is nothing more to look for really i want to be at peace
i would love it if you guys looked at our website and out videos we are called robin first link is the website and it will explain everything
no matter how loud is the music around you how many people are taking pictures with you smiling or even flirting with you you imagine your ex doing the same and the pain revives itself inside you
i kind of pity them as well they are so stuck up and in denial they could turn around and change things but they are unwilling to acknowledge their faults they both had horrible childhoods but i just do not care nothing justifies any of what they did and i am so tired of people telling me to let it go or that i am just being sensitive
hey guys i have honestly ran out of things to do so i am asking for your advicei have tried making friends but i failed i have tried to maybe get online friends but that failed as well i have even got addicted and that sucks i need to find a way to get out of thisanyone came up with anything
you do not realise how much pain the things you have forgiven them for because you until you have a moment to think about them
i was not new to selfharm by then i cut myself first in my 8th grade and only my dad knows about it
ok so i want to know what happens in your everyday life please comment if you can i want to hear it
i think its good to talk about depressions but are the people who without being diagnosed are posting if my mum says it again ill cut myself or i have mood swings i am bipolar really depressed and screaming for help or are they just looking for attention i am asking because i can not relate to them my mental ill friends are not like these people who proudly present their mental health issues on social media
but nevertheless i still get into dark days almost twice a week and it has caused me to make him anxious because of it i just do not know what to do and need some advice if anyones been through this on what to do i feel like i am just getting worse
i am glad we are friends still but i know she is really moving on seeing other guys hanging out with pals studying something she is really passionate about
truly believed we would last until the end of time because we just seemed so good together recent months things have been rocky but not bad enough to assume an official breakup was on the way
like i want to be able to move on but not cut contacts i know i sound so fucked up or this sounds weird
sorry if my rambling sounds a little off i am just talking my feelings out with no structure and english is not my mother language
i have outlined my experience with it and some steps that have worked for me to build my self esteem and find joy in participation
and has anyone any other suggestions to what i have just wrote this is a copypaste for a post i did at rbreakups
over the years i became very emotionless and unbothered by my failures both currently i feel like time is slipping away right before my eyes
no one really gives a fuck besides my parents but that is because they are obligated to care if they were not around i do not think i would have anyone who would really care about me
i am thinking about telling my parents but i do not know if i should or if it will ruin my relationship with my parents i currently hate myself in these moments and i do not know what to do
so i recently started dating a guy and he is the absolute sweetest he is always there for me and he is pretty much all around amazing
dose anyone else find it hard to keep thier room bedroom clean and chores done when they are in a major depressive episode or am i just being lazy
he said he unblocked her bc he valued the friendship they had and that he wants to prove to me that they are just friends
i need my meds as my small supply is running out i messaged his somewhat responsible mum i will be filing a report to the cops however i believe it may ne useless they have not taken me seriously for most of this hellhole trip
i do acknowledge that my mother has her own issues due to her own strict upbringing grew up as the only daughter of a chinese family pressured to be first in everything including academically which is why she chose to move to another country to get away from her family in her mid 20s
mines today and i just do not want to deal with anyone especially family that treats me like shit the rest of the year i would just rather be left alone
we lived together and were exclusive for over a year and a half she was both amazing and the bane of my existence at the same time
i can not begin to tell you how excited i am to see the new year in with you it is officially my 16th birthday i am almost an adult now
in a way this is my last hope to the world that i may still be needed what i ask of you is not to pity me as i have received much of that
to avoid accidentally breaking the antiincitement rule do not say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea or that someone can not turn back or is already dead do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome at least in this little corner of the world our talking tipshttpredditigh87 offer more detailed guidance
it was so abrupt from my perspective we had our struggles but i had no indication this was where we were
he is happily moved on i am pleased for him i hope it works out but how is it so easy for him and not for me
anxiety has been worse than ever and depressed thoughts are in my head every time i am always anxious and i do not have anyone only my parents the commander that supposed to be kind of a helper she talked to me felt like talking to a wall
i almost committed suicide because of feelings of loneliness and now i feel scared to admit that i do feel lonely
the main reason for this was that i was very busy at this time i worked in a regular 9 to 5 job and builded my own business at the same time
now everyone will view me as a man posing as a womani barely turned 18 and i want to fucking die
everyone around me always told me i would find my people in high school i did not then they told me i would find them in college i still have not now they tell me i will find them in my post graduation i doubt their claims since i feel like i am constantly moving the goalpost
i am not a perfect person who tf is but i have never done anything so terribly bad for someone to reasonably hate me that much
and i would not be surprised if at least one stopped fighting those feelings of anger bitterness and resentment but we all have to fight those feelings because if we do not our relationships in all forms will one deteriorate and fall apart the exact opposite of what all of us here want
i just want some relief because i am so tired of my feelings i just want to react normally to stuff i want an actual life
i have had covid and rocky mountain to the point that i was almost hospitalized with each through it all i felt alone
i love how we heal together moving forward in consciousness in strides loving to learn creative and how you are willing to truly love me in all my glorious flaws
every time i see a photo with all of them together and i am left out it pains me and i genuinely want to cry
being able to think positive haha this is evidence that they have no real issues and never had issues in the first place
so its been a rough year for everyone i know everybody is going through such a rough time i know it is been such a horrible year and i hope everybody is having a better christmas
when i take any time to do things for myself like today i am not working even though some of our clients are working i find it incredibly hard to do anything
listening to others talk sometimes makes you realize how different your life is a lot of us are like this but when you listen to actual normal people talk it feels like listening to an alien language does anyone agree or am i just crazy now lol
this month i started trying again but that only made me feel even more worthless and frustrated so i will stop contacting her forever from now on
she goes back to college in latejanuary for 4 months at least i am trying to make sense of all of this mess
this was the nail in the coffin that i cannot be with you in the long runwhen you grow up you do not grow with depression it is formed over time
i have struggled with depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts my whole life it seems pretty unwarranted from the outside but for a good portion of my life i have known it would end by suicide i had made pretty detailed plans on how to do it by causing the least amount of pain possible as far as who would find my body
she is my high school love and it fucking hurts that we have to seperate because i feel she is dictating the relationship on her terms and my feeling are not being considered
i am not really into that stuff like that i just come online here and there and sometimes i kind of just casual browse around
sleeping alone especially is very hard the pain from the sadness is even physical my chest aches i sometimes cry for so long that i get tremendous headaches
i swear i know it is stupid but i think he is my twin flame i have never been this stuck in one person before never
there is not really anyone to blame but myself sure my life was not great maybe i got dealt some bad cards but did nothing with them i ruined my life even more over the years and now i am in a hole i feel like i can not get out of it is not possible for me to feel genuine happiness anymore or even be content with life
i miss having a companion who shares my tastes for the most part at the very least it makes sense to change the method of suicide
i feel like i have no right to even be breathing i feel like i stole someone elses chance in living a life
why must i try and try and dedicate my life to this when other people just exist and have people they can care about i do not get it
i am dealing with diagnosed ocdanxiety including self worth and self image issues anger management family conflict and relationship issues because of my insurance i can only see one therapist at a time
2 i do not have a place to stay and would have to find a flat for lease if i went right now
i still wanted her in my life and wanted her to bother me it was essentially self harm just talking to her
when i said to him that he is rich i did not mean that she is a gold digger like he thought i was trying to say but that by having that much family money he realistically would not have had too many problems searching for another girl somewhere else and have success at it in my opinion and i am not necessarily talking about gold diggers or sluts
can someone tell me what it means to be human to have friends etcjust here thinking of all the possible ways i could die
now like i know there is just a depression phase that happens every so often for me but i do not think i have ever felt so upset and yet so calm about it
i just feel lonely and ashamed and unworthy of living i would rather end it tonight then live through years of misery
the pain just will not seem to leave this time around i am always pissed off lately and it is exhausting to be angry and to push it down
and i am so weird i do not even want to cut contact with him like i want to try and be friends or something i can not bring myself to block contacts with him
to expand on what type of person i am i am a narcissist i used to have bad anxiety but i have started taking medication for it around 2 months ago i lack certain emotions like empathy remorse sadness i think i lie a lot to people because it is fun and i manipulate those around me to get my way i do not feel bad about it at all i am actually proud of it i believe i am better than everyone and i have not gotten anything diagnosed
this morning all of those conversations were just left on seen i do not even feel the need to check my phone these days since i know i will have no notifications from anyone
he said we would be friends after breaking up too but it is as if we are complete strangers now then we went to a new mall
i wish i never opened up but i needed to i know not everyone is going to understand and such but being called crazy for wanting to seek help just threw me out of the window if i did not need this i would not do this if only i could go alone i wanted to wait until i am eighteen before seeking help but it is getting too much
i get most of what i said just shows the lows of our relationship even if there is no point of thinking about the highs now i just want to say it was actually fine
so i finally got enough energy yesterday to pick myself up and go into the shower for the first time in weeks
when i have raised it with him he is so blank and asks me to tell him what to do so i still have to think about what to do
by the time our breakup came around he claimed he did not want to be tied down to me and wanted to explore but called it a break rather than a breakup in case it did not all work out with someone else
it is like no matter how much effort i put into my appearance my body is mocking me personalitywise i am boring uninteresting shy extremely introverted
i do not really know why i feel this way but i just wish i could go back to a year ago where i was isolated and was not as present on the internet
here is one more paragraph of me trying my best to explain what i deal with just in case i did not explain it well enough
we had what i think was a good relationship but with time i noticed how seemingly small personal quirks turned into actuall mental health issues the cute affection she showed me turned into a dependency mixed with extreme anxiety and spirals of obsessive need for control
it went really well and he talked about meeting my friends it just felt very relationshipy and natural he was sweet and funny and sensitive and smart and had lots of great friends and family
if she still loved me why would she leave me so quickly and easily why would not she at least try to stick it out and communicate with me she apparently decided this within the span of a month and did not even bother to mention anything about it to me
many of my friends had busy families and siblings to take care of something i could not relate to but the problem is nothing makes me happy notably because i do not feel happiness
i just recently moved in with my mother again after almost seven months of cps removing my siblings and i from her care due to a case of child neglect involving only myself
nowadays i just do not have people to talk to as much anymore and i am starting to think that is one of the biggest reasons i have lost passion for my interests
i have had 4 tumor removals done so far in the span of 11 years i learned i will be getting another operation done next year which is making me feel pessimistic about my future
2 weeks ago he called me i was cutting contact telling me he loves me and misses me and would do anything told me if i say a word he will jump on a plane and fly over and be with me right now but i said no this seemed like a cry for help like he wanted me to take responsibility to be able later to pull out saying well you wanted it
thank youthis is mostly about his friendsmy girlfriend broke up with me about 2 days ago and i have been such a mess
i do not feel like facing my parents who have so many expectations from me for understandable reasons tho i wish it would all end soon
i am tired i really can not love myself it is hard and i am trying but i am sorry if i am failing miserably my own body and my own name haunts me and it sucks i cannot get away from my own identity and what makes me me
i have always been pretty intelligent and loved thinking so much so rather than just enjoy the high i tried every time to take something out of it more like from a little psychedelic trip
and the more meaning the fulfillment you attached to your past relationship and the more you were connected to your ex the more empty and hopeless you feel right now
my boyfriend left me about two weeks ago he said he decided that he was going to leave back in julyaugust so has he just been using me not once did he say a single thing we could have worked things out i had no idea we weere having issues did the past four years even happen so disrespectful i can not stand it i am seething
6 months ago i was a few bad days away from ending it and i was around 285lbs give it take 5lbs depending on how that week was going i was actually trying to eat better get more exercise and generally lose weight
after the second time i opened up to my wife about my struggles she took me to see someone and i was put on anti depressants
around the same time i changed schools because i moved only to the neighboring city where things started to get complicated
one affair is not going to replace what i feel but it has actually made me feel worse the longing for a constant touch has outweighed the patiently waiting period till i saw him again
that thing breaks or falls apart if that your confidence falls apart when it was your confidence that created all of that
will i ever hear your sweet voice calling my name again will i ever see the smile that brought so many warm memories if not then the memory will never be enough
it is only a matter of time before i have completely lost my mind i do not see how i can ever be successful no degree no job 22 and unable to support myself i want to be able to go through with it but can not
then we started talking in january because our mutual friends told us about each other and apparently he wanted to study architecture too
lately it is really been bothering me i have been thinking about it nearly every single hour of the day still trying to get rid of the memory but it is really really hard to think about it really just makes me want to die
fast forward a day or two and i just tell her i miss her she says she misses me too and we talk about just cuddling and making plans to see each other soon
i have forgotten how to even make a friend and it feels too late since we are already half way through and i have not really seen anyone i see myself being friends with if that makes sense
we would call everyday message each other good mornings treat each other to food and sent each other gifts but as time went by tension increased from not being able to see her physically
i think a lot of social circles in life tend to be a complete waste of time i think human beings are an overrated species
i get start to rely too heavily on the ventilator because i turned lazy and it is not that i needed it it was a force of habit and i started to eat food orally by mouth connected to the ventilator 247
what should i do i am sorry if this is not the right place to post if not is there anywhere else i could go for this
but whenever i think of meeting her or confronting her i only have thoughts of self harm or suicide i really do not know what i should make of my life from here on
it was because i had hope and i knew you were giving me some sign to have that first one was emotionally abusive second one told me she would kill herself if i left apologized years later
and they are leaving stuff here i feel like i do not belong in my own apartment but i also do not call people very often
i will get through this and i will find happiness again but today i want to just curl up and sleep until i wake up and feel nothing for her
they discussed it and decided she needed to cut things off with me sadly i accepted this and was resolute in my desire to leave her be
within those 2 years after our breakup i had a lot of self growth spiritual awakening and realization that although she hurt me there were a lot of things i was doing that also hurt her and i did not want to hurt someone else like that again or atleast just acknowledge my own toxic tendencies to better my relationships with people i care about
2 years ago i was my happiest in a city that i loved with friends i liked no boyfriend or lots of money to get by but i was truly happy
she is someone who i am very respectful for having in my life just because i have never had someone be as good as a friend as her
i am always in the wrong to my family and who knows the fuck they would do if they find out i no longer believe in that shit
he bailed three of five days due to weather his choiceyou know they will be lessvisited and kept in the forgotten spots of their brains
people have it way worse including some that owe me money winter is coming and i still stare down at my phone too much and waste time ruminating
even we are in different cities rn due to the holiday i can not visit him as well he keep saying you are good person and he feels like he harms me with nerve blowns and keep refusing to talk much as we used to do because i try to make him feel well but with asking questions about it i guess it is a bad idea idk what i can do shit
i wanted to start a life and you wanted to be a free man you wanted to live in the city and i wanted
at some points i just feel so hopeless and tired of living that i stop caring i am not instantly searching for some remedy just accept that if anything were to happen i would not mind
my older sibling fat shamed me and my parents made jokes about my weight as well they laughed and watched me get mad
i still love you i know i said i want us to be happy but i still feel like i would be happy with you i am still processing the fact that you are gone it hurts
i do not like it and do not know how to feel what do i dojust could use some advice with my situation
she even points out the time how i showed myself being angry at her in front of her friends because of her behavior
i just escaped this with my mom 2 years ago when i left the state for college and here i am following in my moms footsteps
so ill wear my fake smile to hide the tears in my eyes ill stand up straight to hide the crippling sadness in my heart
but i know she has selfdestructive tendencies and it has hard to know she is indulging in them without doing anything about it
i can not keep up with her ideologies one second she is a communist and then two years later she is thinks that coronavirus is fake in that the vatican has been hijacked
i tried so hard to help you transition i tried to teach you about your hair and how to take care of it
i really want to get the but in the form of jewelry but i feel like i may not be qualified for it
overall i fucking hate my life right now and i do not have anyone to talk to that will not keep my situation private and about the suicide part i have been thinking about it all more often and thinking about ways to end it all but i am too scared of pain and the after effects if i succeed i do not know what lies ahead of me and i am dearly afraid of the future i do not know what the hell to do with myself
i lost myself that night you knew i have bpd that we can fix this that we both only want one another
just really having a hard time coming to terms with everything i have dealt with so much emotional and verbal abuse and occasionally physical altercations and i am sick of it
women throw themselves at me sometimes which kind of rocks my dogs were born a while ago and now they are the cutest little bears
if they are actually looking for attention i think its disrespectful towards the diagnosed people who do not talk about their real depressions because they are scared or think no one cares about them
i am human and bound to make mistakes i tried my best and now i am seeking help and i should be proud of that many other people stay stubborn and blinded like the breakup is all their partners fault i at least have the dignity to admit it is partly my fault and the courage to better myself i think that this actually makes me a good person
when you feel the internal dialogue being too much that its stressing you out play the song play it loud and drown out the thoughts

i have always known that i have wanted to kill myself especially with the increase in family issues i have dealt with over the past 9 years
g cheating or anything like that that she might change her mind she told me not to expect and just focus on myself for now
i said are we talking then and she said she will let me know you replied i do not want to be with you next year not here not anywhere
i truly did try my best to smile through these tough times and seek help but i just can not seem to catch a break
i thought my reputation was funny and cool but when it set in it set in hard the guilt for the sister situation was strong
i am a 29 year old science teacher extorverted and married with no kids my job push me to interact with hundreds of people every year so i am not isolated at all basically i have no problems to find new people and meet them

all my friends are leaving to go back home my flatmate included they are german and are allowed to travel home
we had been dating for almost 7 months by then just that morning i asked if she still wanted me to go to her house on wednesday
i do not know what to do once they are there doing what they want to do talking about the things they like
he thought i am there for his money i love him but am unable to express to him i do not think now our relationship will be the same again
there were no hard feelings at all and we were friendly after even though we did not both specifically say no contact i have been trying to keep my distance from him
i have even gone as far as setting up three people to be beneficiaries to my accounts and take ownership of all of my belongings without having to bother with a will
why yes your wife was raped and molested as a child and still has mental issues but i do not want to start any trouble by trying to help her
also keep in mind its not like i am a nobody with no future i am currently 18 i have multiple jobs with a steady income i was in paramedic school at the time and i am already investing
tldr right now i am just feeling a lot of anger because i feel like i have been cheated out of so many years of my life because of wrong diagnosis and treatment
school does not even give me a chance to get a good job no matter what i always end up with an e
during our break between classes me and her would always go to get some coffee together and then head to class
and instead of reassuring me he said that me not trusting him is creating a distance and if i want to do that then fine etc
she said now that she feels i do not do anything an it is just her doing everything an no longer cares about me or what i do
i do not want to have regrets and i want to be able to accept the situation i had a discussion with my ex just yesterday
i am not asking for anyone to feel bad for me or give me sympathy because i know what i did was horrible
we barely text because whenever i try he leaves me on read or i get some annoying sexual comment the other dude i have known for maybe over a year but we are almost constantly texting eachother
when i was 18 i dated this older stripper for a few months i will call her by her stage name cleo anyway at first it was great i lost my virginity to this woman the sex was amazing and i liked having an older woman and a stripper for a girlfriend it pretty much put me on the top of the social pecking order
sadly the girl i have been with for the past year has never once done anything to make me question being cheated on
i have decided to leave not because i am over my ex still got some work to do there but because i keep delving into these subreddits looking for the hope she will come back or asking what if questions to try and see different perspectives
i realize how hard i have been in denial of this in my reality so much so that it appeared in my dream
no one besides my partner and previous therapists know what happened my partner is often frustrated that this person is still around
i have the hardest time letting people get to know me and get close i have this she will around me that stops me from building any relationship with anyone
i do not exactly struggle with close relationships or anything i have actually made quite a few funny enough loving and caring for others comes naturally to me in my close relationships i care about people and i love spending time with them but i feel like i will never be the same as them it feels so unfair
i ended up turning to self harm for a while i was always angry at myself for that i do not know how else to overcome the trauma this has left on me
if i look at the future it is just a continuation of these most miserable days how long can i keep pretending there is hope
deep down it really hurted me because i tend to be lonely at my freetime but at work i come along good with everybody even tho i am big introvert and i maybe do not give that much out of myself to people i really would like to know why i did not get invited
subsequent to my now exwife and me deciding to live apart i attempted to pursue a number of romantic relationships most never lasting more than three contiguous months i wanted to be in a romantic relationship but once i was committed to someone i found that i lost interest in the relationship despite my own efforts to sustain it
he is always had a crush on me and last year in september i decided to give it a chance i fell in love with my best friend
this guy that no one actually even knows i do not know sometimes i think i would just be nice to talk to someone honestly
i have been to several therapists in the past and i am passed on to one therapist who passes me on to someone else who dumps my case entirely over and over again

i dwell on my life being without purpose i literally have no hobbies i can not go anywhere small town 3000 people basically live in the bedroom and in my own head beating myself up not knowing what to do with my life
how i just want him to take me back how i do not know what to do without him right now i am fine and clear headed but these moments happen so spontaneously
but what do you feel would make the perfect mental health yt channel are there elements in any of the current channels as good as soooo many of them are i must say that are just missing
i was absolutely fine with the situationship due to several reasons as long as it was with him but he said he did not want this continuous thing any longer

i think less about you sometimes i space out and think about texting you about things that happened during the day
my boyfriend of almost two years 5 years as best friends as well broke up with me month ago there was not a definitive because he could not put more effort in and wanted to focus on himself i really thought he was the one for i am still so in love and i cry myself to sleep every night
hey so i am a bit out of my comfort zone writing this but i feel desperate for some thoughts advice or at the least to just get some things off my chest
i am not being able to explain everything here but i am going through a lot i texted my ex and told her the same thing and she would not even respond

we still spent our nights together but it gave us a chance to take space and cool off while we worked through whatever issues arose
link free 4day email series how to feel less lonely and more happyhttpstessbuycomp7o0was thinking about how nice they are in yoshis story this morning and it made me cry
what i have to lose to be lonely and sad everyday to see yourself roting everyday to cry i want to end this all
just want to share with everyone my passion project my friend molly and i started a virtual talk show hotline we
he talked about marrying me just a few months before our break up now it seems he is found another girl and we have only been split 3 months
provided there is in fact such a bias would it still play a role if a was seeking medical attention for something that is generally unlikely to be related to as mental health situation
so 3 weeks ago my gf asked me to move to leeds with her for the start of her 2nd year of uni
i am surrounded by people but i still feel lonely i push everyone away i always feel like everyone will leave me in the end
she would spend the whole break outside smoking since she knows i do not do any of that she looked at me and said no the dogs just going to piss on it again
i am not rich i am middle class average looking etc society associates these things like cutting with the it is just a phase emo kids i am not
and to the flippant assholes my mind mocks me enough as it is i do not need you to do it as well fuck off back to 4chan that is where your kind belong you will find more of yourselves there and you will be better off for it
but my own feelings however he is helped me through so much and i have treated him like shit in return why i do not know i do not know what is wrong with me anymore he deserves so much better
fast forward to the start of the covid19 pandemic my mental stability was and still is at the lowest point of my life
i know you blocked me and told me you do not want to talk with me ever again it is almost like i am slowly going back into the hole because i no longer have hope
but i can not seem to let him go i work at the same place as my ex who broke up with me nearly 4 months ago
last night 122420 i intentionally took triple my dosage of fluoxetineprozac 40mg is my normal i took 120mg as well as 10mg of melatonin out of curiousity and selfdestrucitve impulse
hi there my names leo i am 23 m i have had ongoing struggles with mental health issues the last 8 years over this time receiving at least 3 diagnosis depression adhd and the most recent being schizophrenia
i really missed having someone i could just talk to someone who i can trust to talk about things which i never said to anyone
kind of sucks though because it is literally christmas tomorrow and i really thought i would be able to make it through the holidays and i had something going on with friends on saturday but idk how much more of this daily grind i can endure just to get a tiny ounce of satisfaction that only comes a couple times each month
tomorrow is my birthday i will be 35 with nothing to show parents dead no love no family of my own i honestly wish i was never born
i cannot accept this by any means becuase she helped me and i helped her she was there for me and so was i
i would not eat at lunch since i had no one to sit with and spent free periods alone in the library
i am forced to be in a really boring hospital room but at least i got my phone so if anyone need to talk or just vent i would love to listen to your story thank you all
it all started in 2017 between me and her crazy when i think about itwrite it down or voice note it to yourself
over the past two years i have slowly realized that i am not fully there 99 of the time it is like i am dreaming almost
the next morning we were able to contact him and he told me that he wants to fix his life and more importantly my brothers life
but eventually i started to figure out who her exs are past relationships etc and it is gotten me worried if she was running to them instead to me
i was not doing so great to begin with a year of living and working at home alone for a person who hates himself who does not enjoy his own company
now a word of warning meditating does feel uncomfortable the first few times you do it you are not accustomed to the painful sitting position the weird sensation or the act of thinking about nothing it feels like going crazy sometimes
for that second i saw a glimmer of the old him i knew i had made him mad but the fact that i knew he still loved me kept me going
i have been having a rough time with my anxiety and lately i have been finding myself ruminating a lot on fake scenarios that will definitely not come true but make me happy
my current relationship is very complicated but i love them with all my heart yet i always feel like i have been fucking up and can not do anything right
c liked anime but outside of that i was basically that one solitary chuuni middle school dumbass that people only tolerated because i was just self aware enough to know that i was much preferred with my mouth clamped shut
and it hurt that he revealed that he was lyingtrying to convince himself when he wrote empty promises in my birthday card and our anniversary card of many more years to come
maybe sometimes i overreacted sometimes i could not give you the support you needed but i loved you i honestly loved you
it is rlly extremely exhausting having this mentaltiy and i need advice on how to decrease it then i come home and i am all alone no one to confide in except my boyfriend
then sometimes ill hear a voice screaming my name telling me to come up or sometimes i am swimming in the depths and find where its going to the shore
symptoms i can remember were things such as having a hard time gaining weight lack of facial hair overly competitive etc
obviously you do not have to do everything everyday and can take breaks in between days but that will allow you to focus on other things in between those break days
i have followed this project httpslonelinesslaborghttpslonelinesslaborg which took an interesting approach to addressing loneliness in their community i would like to do a version of that where i live
my parents are separated and my mom associates everything i do to my dad and constantly calls my abusive for absolutely no reason people say that the real world is harsh but i do not think i can handle a world any realer than this
how he felt when i distanced myself bc apart of me did not want to be with him anymore apart of me felt like he was pushing me back further
i have never heard anyone talk about feeling like this but i can not be the only one i just want to stop hurting people if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated
i can not be slightly down and not cheerful at all no he is putting distance between us or at least he did for the first week
i do not know his knifes and the knife was finethis physical pressure i am feeling is it stress boredom am i out of my depth
later that day i went into her office and asked if i could just leave i was shaking and on the verge of tears
i am not really or totally hating her for betraying my trust though almost not at all even though she left me at a quite really bad time for me maybe the worst period of my live given my interpersonal issues depression anxiety
i thought we were unbreakable i am trying so hard to get past this i know i should not hold on anymore it is just so hard
this happened on december from last year i had a final at uni one i actually studied for and i was prepared for
thanks for reading and happy holidays to you allit is just chronic emptiness depression and self hatred every fucking day i have a big heart and it makes me sad when i am sad
nothing is left change is not an option anymore i destroyed all my possibilities and i can not keep looking at this broken husk anymore
and i am so worried that after i die she will expose me i do not want to be in pain and i want it to be quick
i am not sure what emotions i feel i feel tired not wanting to help my dad with his workit is been a month and a half since we have broken up
it starts first thing in the morning when i wake up and there is no good morning text and then i think about him all day long
i was passively depressed for the last few years and things in my life were getting worse and worse every year and by the end of this year a whole pile of shit hit a fan out of nowhere
she is really my whole world i just i know it is not over yet but i also know this is way too much to put on another person which is why i am just considering doing it anyway so i will not be a burden to everyone else anymore
i feel so alone and i try so hard to do the right thing i work so hard in school and study and nothing ever pays off or works out
since its about my loneliness depression and plans i guess it fits i realize that probably noone will read this colossus but i just want to leave something behind
so i am mad because i want to be with him but i feel like i have too much power over him he has me on a pedestal and i just want to be equals
i feel like i am supposed to feel happy or at least happier with everything that is going on for me she had a very unhealthy fear of abandonment and she had no healthy ways of managing that
it is just taken for granted that you should have a bfgf and have sex with them because it is what some movie says it is what people on porn websites etc
i have depression and anxiety possible autism i am 15 and its getting continuously worse i have started a new anti depressant a few weeks ago and my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse
i have always had a relationship with him but we were never close and my mom worked 3 jobs at times to support the two of us because my dad was not very good with child support
the biggest ones that i have wondered about are the personality disorder diagnoses i have been diagnosed with borderline and schizoid once each and not otherwise specified twice
it is pretty pathetic to want to kms on christmas but it sorta makes since i do not want to come home empty handed and eventually be evicted or find and work a job that i hate and can not survive on i am not helping anyone by being here and i do not have any real reason to live i am just too much a coward and i wish euthanasia was legal here and covered by insurance
i have been dealing with heightened states of anxiety and paranoia lately but in a way that just feels really weird i understand where a lot of it is coming from but the manifestation seems different
i could solve the problem of how to actually learn web development from scratch 0 prior experience on my own 0 tutors 0 bootcamps nothing except online free or very cheap stuffbooks to secure that fucking job
i am very love her and everyone know that sometime i am very tired after a hard work day i am a tour guider she even do not care about me she is just so cold and she find another guys i really mean guys to chat with her
i have got a plan i fantasize about it constantly have for a long time can barely bring myself to get out of bed if i could just get over my fear of death i would have done it already but i am too selfish and cowardly can not even cut myself anymore do not know where else to put these feelings but here i can not tell anyone irl i am drowning in my own head
we clicked well and there was flirting and all but i again was afraid to tell her how i really felt i accept that it is my fault and i should work on that anyway we became best friends and i was able to get over her
but if this is about a friend ik sometimes it is hard to come to terms with the fact you might be growing apart but remember not everyone is supposed to stay in you are life
it was pretty much always either do what they want to do or do things on my own as for friendships i have kind of always been the other friend
now i have no plans for the future i have been severely depressed for a couple of years now so i do not know if i can keep on living without her i do not have the strenght to study let alone get a job when i have noone to to do it for i am extremely dependent on other people and now i lost the one i had planned my future with
you will probably just be reminded of your struggle whereas before reading the post you were feeling fine and so the negative thinking restarts
its been basically three days since we broke up i have gotten sick and its finals week so days are all merged together at this point but its been hard now that i have finally gotten the time to think about you
i am a single 40 year old man and i have really been feeling loneliness today some days it seems that i hardly have a meaningful conversation with anyone even my socalled family i live in a hellhole of a hick town and it is gotten even worse here since the pandemic so i might just have to leave for somewhere else
during the break up she told me she loved me and told me when i was ready to commit to someone to let her know
now when i think about it i feel like a piece of crap the second time probably 34 months after the first incident i started talking to this second girl
also the corona situation also affects me mentally bad not just me everyone actually but i was like this before corona too
he is sick he does not possess the tools to even be aware of his illness i am helpless i believe it is too late for him
he must be right with all the work and all he does remain busy i am still hurting but not as much as before not all the time
i have been told by my therapist that i have issues feeling certain emotions like remorse empathy etc and this has affected all of my relationships
i am focusing on my health right now he did not believe me when i said i was sick and was not there emotionally for me
but i have to remind myself constantly of why it did not work why am i crying though feel kind of blindsided by everything she said none of her friends or family knew how she felt about this
many people with mental health problems will start to feel ashamed of guilty for receiving gifts or a big plate of food they will feel as if they do not deserve it reassure them that they are doing fine that you will always be there for them and they more than deserve it
i feel like all those memories i had spending time with my mom growing up were a past life i know they were real but i can not feel any attachment to those memories anymore
i am afraid of living i am afraid of dying it was an emotional abusive relationship he would threaten to kill himself every time we had argument
but ever since covid i have just been so down and empty i am 19 years old and will be dropping out of college this year
one night in august of 2019 my family fell victim to that they are moving on with their life and so should you you can not change anything
i mean all i want in the world is just to be cared about but people refuse i texted my ex and told her the same thing and she would not even respond
not to sound egotistical at all but i feel like if someone can relate it might make me feel slightly better please someone
when he asked me about this during finals week i told him it stressed me out to talk about it and that he had nothing to worry about
i worked in a regular 9 to 5 job and builded my own business at the same time i think many of you can understand how time consuming it was
make the people around laugh as i tell jokes that make me look like a fool where i am forced to be professional and not really speak my mind
the issue i am not happy not for a single moment of the day every time i achieve something i just think about everything i have not achieved i allow myself maybe 10 seconds to be happy with an achievement and then my thoughts are immediately onto the next goal
she stood by me through my depression and helped me reignite my desire to learn i supported her when her grandfather passed and she felt she has no friends
everything just sounds so perfect and i can not wait i would stop her from eating pencils getting bullied we would play hide and seek
i do not know how to do it i am already in really many discord servers but i mostly just write at the beginning on the same day i join and then i just stop really interacting with it mostly because i do not know what or how to write something or join an ongoing conversation
i honestly feel like it is due to social anxiety and ocd especially when he over thinks certain social situations however nobody in his extended family knows what he is going through mentally
we meet again days later same thing not phased at all but also can not look me in the eyes distancing himself will not get close to me
i feel so split in one way i am like what would that be sign of he was already talking to someone new last time you talked he is probably already datingfucking with her
it was a deep cut and she claimed it was a lapse in judgment in the moment she wanted to end her life but one very deep cut made her want to live
my mother leaving when i was 4 getting bullied relentlessly in school my first real girlfriend my first breakup my mistakes in the workplace
after being released around midnight with the condition to show up in court the day after and can not go back home contact her etc
do not they understand that shit fucking kills me i do not want to be like this i do not want to have suicidal thoughts and hurt myself
he is aware of my past and ongoing trust issues and basically screamed at me in front of the bar that i am insane and if he would like to do those things he will do it anyway
i just recently got out of a relationship with my girlfriend of two years because she said she wanted to know what it was like to have a life outside of myself it is been really hard for to me to cope with missing her and feeling like i am missing a part of me does anyone have any advice on some ways to cope with missing her
no one knew where i was and i was used to no one coming to help me regardless of the terror and now again the danger
she left me like this on purpose built me up for our awesome plans to blindside me and stonewall all communication even after 4 months she will not tell me her side of the story probably because it is just as evil as i imagine
i will lose everything if my dad dies i am really scared and i need to help him but i do not know how
if anything i was the better half of the relationship he was immature and did not know how to communicate well and i was teaching him
i have also reached out and told her she could talk to me if she wanted to the fear of the punishmentcurse is stronger than the fear of the compulsion
it hurts so much to think about it alli have stated seeing a psychiatrist but i have only seen them a few times idk
i am a 22 year old female residing in central california finished junior college got my cna and in an lvn program
i am depressed because of all the health issues i have dealt with this year and my leg is recovering slowly and still hurts since june when i hurt myself
so here i am still living with my parents working as a barista lonely as helllurker here 1st time poster hopefully the only time haha
now i have pushed away everyone important to me and ruined everything good in my life i do not really want to die but i can not live this way anymore i think about killing myself all day and every day now it is been like this for years my first attempt was at 8 years old and i have somehow made it to 33
mental illness does not take days off it is not working shifts when you are living with a mental illness everyday will feel the same
some weeks after that i found out that she was talking with other guys the whole time then came my 2nd mistake
with higher selfesteem you can also givereceive more love and engage in deeper intimacy in general if i stay here too much i might actually freaking kill my self
i think about you constantly 1 question on my mind is if you will text me tomorrow wish me a merry christmas
when he went back to his country although we were still planning to move to england together he was a completely different person
right before we got involved she disclosed to me she was a married womanmem28 was with her for 4 years we lived together the whole time
i had a final at uni one i actually studied for and i was prepared for no it is my fucking fault and i do not mean that as a judgement
healing has not come easy to me i find myself still mad at you sometimesi am just kind of over everything at the moment i have no money i am barely eating
i do not know if i will ever find someone anyways i think it is unhealthy if we all go too long of periods without touching another person physically
it is christmas day and i feel extremely lonely i do not have any friends who actually care enough about me to wish me a merry christmas at least
i have always been so introverted and overly sensitive since as long as i can remember at the age of 5 i tried cutting my wrists with a knife because something upset me real bad
fast forward to this days tim bring this deseas thing up once in a while always in random situations and i do not really know how to deal with it
he is running from his problems now he said i do not know how long i am going to be in va for it could be two four maybe six months but once i leave i am not interested in long distance i said so i am just time pass he said you are the most perfect girl i have ever dated but i am not okay and i have failed here and that we should continue doing what we are but he can not see any possibility of it being anything more than an exclusive thing
i do not feel that i have a future i think and i think i try and i try to see a future for myself but it is blank
aaahhhhh why can not i get her out of my fucking head i want to kill myself sometimes by either hanging myself or jumping in front of a train
hey guys i am a phd student in psychology and i just released a video delving into the research on loneliness and solitude let me know what you think httpsyoutubeuq65ijeyvyhttpsyoutubeuq65ijeyvy
bbc being full of horrible news from across the world and the other channel either full of some ignorant women dressed up like whores unable to even form proper sentences or again all the bad news
at the beginning of the pandemic i put an end of life plan into my medical paperwork and specifically added a dnr i wish it was easy to just walk out into the wilderness and slowly freeze to death i do not want to keep going like this until i am a wizened old man alone and isolated and no one to even care to find my body not that anyone would care now
i got fired i have tried texting and everytime he just says please stop i have even seeked therapy in the last week
the one that would look at you with honest transparent deep eyes and tell you softly i adore you always
i do not have meds on i do not do any drugs or drink if you are nice enough to help that is nice just give me advice for her and me
i want the pain and sorrow to end i want to put myself out of my misery i am very selfishly scared of not being loved again like that
i met other expats of course but plenty of germans showed up to these as well people respected me and soon enough i had plenty of people consistently messaging me to hang out
i requested the day off and am off today so that is good i am planning to go out to dinner with my family tonight outdoors
but that does not mean yours is please reach out to someone i guess that will be it from me thank you for reading if you have
as we were driving my dad called and told us that when my uncle was actually leaving he would let my uncle know what was going on despite it being against my grandmas wishes
i have so much and am really privileged but i will still find time in my perfect day to look into my knife draw or off the side of a cliff while thinking the worst
i really do not think i can do another year of this the only future i can see for myself is one i do not want
it just seems like there is nothing left to do but to end it and yet i know i can not i am not sure where to go from here
i just miss talking to him or being able to call him to talk about my day and laugh or joke about the things we had together
happy things make me sad and stuff like that i have cried to my mom and boyfriend about it and i know i can talk to them
you can feel amazing too you can find a great medication and an great therapist no matter what painful experiences you go through during your journey in finding them you deserve everything the world has to offer
i would be like that for the whole winter everything to not fall into another deep depression but i am so fucking lonely
i always felt down and like no one could support me it is never really went away but about 6 months ago i told my parents after someone told me to kill myself and i tried my dad does not understand still and my mum help me through a lot
i have trust issues with those things i do not trust themone day in school i exploded everyone in my class the fear they saw haunts me still
what am i supposed to do please do not say anything like get over her i have tried literally dozens of therapists apparently i am quite picky
i repeat i do not have problems with my actual life even if there is some bad day i am just curious to die
whenever i get into moments like this i just can not think of any options to move forward i mean i know what other people would do
so i never seen or heard any real hallutinations even from lsd or tabs and i was so angry when she alrdy come out then goes bakc tried to top up me a bit in my life a nd i see wha t she is alrdy have an new bf
almost a year ago i went on health leave from my phd program because i was too anxious and depressed to complete my work i had been struggling with depression grief for awhile and anxiety for a long time before that i go through ups and downs have moments where i feel some relief from a visit or music but only as a temporary distraction
i have so much to live for and i am so grateful but whenever life pushes me to the ground i think about dying by my own hand on my own terms
we hit a rough patch after dating since august we have both been dealing with some depression and there was one night where we started to talk about our feelings and i fucked up
for me personally it is even more different because i am not in a relationship anymore i broke up with my boyfriend of three years a few months ago and it was not good for me
i had to carry him to the living room and call the police at first i was just so disgusted with her
my family does not care at all they do not call for my help or anything they just told me to man up or deal with it i tried to kill myself yesterday but i could not to it tonight i might do it since it is too much
i worked two jobs and was in grad school more often than not when the 4 of the would argue i was not even around yet they constantly threw my name and my existence up to hurt each other
found out tonight that she is seeing someone else someone i had a weird strong feeling about turns out i was right
i broke up with an narcissistic abusive ex last week i fled with my cat from the house 2 days after the breakup after he secretly put up security cameras without my permission i immediately found out that night and ran and took what i could including a small supply of my medications needed for the short term
i had to quit my job and take another job that paid enough to look after all of us which i hated but i could not balance the demands of that job with caring for my wife and now i have been fired i have nothing lined up for next year and barely time to search
i am still trying to move on i am still trying to work through that i am still pushing through all this
you can not live sitting there waiting for someone who will not come around everything changes people come and go out of your life
for a year they have been having more and more rough sex i begged her again and again to not just feed that she is been in therapy but is stopping now she is at the point where she does not get enough from rough sex like rape play stuff with her fiance she is told me she is been posting stuff online and asking people to tell her what they would do to her again i have begged her not to
it may be that many people here on the internet with me tonight are feeling a bit lost for me christmas used to be one day out of the year where i could tolerate my family
5 weeks ago due to ld we dated for 8 months but were best friends beforehand and our connection was really special
you know what really sucks about this was that she would send me stuff like we need to have this vacation when we need a break in the future or how we would go out wearing matching clothes
when i wake up i quoted same shit different day when in a day my mind says bed and xbox is only solution
2 days before his flight back he told me that he does not think it is going to work so i gave him space to think about things
i just always assumed it was a natural part of life to grow up work marry and have kids but this is not my life and i had no choice in the matter
then try to make that person ask out hisher friends with both of you and here we go you have one more person to interact with
i wonder if he is okay if he still cares if he is completely fine and living his life and already forgot all about me does he need my help did he just ghost me and i am trying to find excuses i honestly do not know i am meeting other people but nothing compares and i feel like i am not really healing but distracting myself
thank you for showing me what i could mean to someone and what someone could mean to me i will always love you and have space in my heart for you
if he can do it so can we what do you have to lose i really hope this helps someone because it has been one of the only things keeping me going
i am really thankfull to tool for all the support if it was not for them i would do it a long time ago
i would like to hear from you guys what makes you alone and what do you think would be the first step in order to find the right way
i know i can not take away her sadness but i can try to make her forget about it a little bit
i who have been reduced as just someone she shares a roof witheveryday is the same i feel out of control with my emotions
what the fuck did i do wrong i just do not want to be alone anymorei am going to sleep this offi will feel better after thatbut i will still be alone
all i have been wanting to do these last few weeks is to talk to a friend about the things that are on my mind someone who understands my past and the things i have been through
i know it is the circumstances as well it would never happen if the distance was not there but that does not justify it does it
the negative will loves to do this it loves to destroy anything our positive will loves to build this is because we have set up our minds to fight against us
some have helped for a short amount of time my mom got me to do this after all those events this fall
i feel bad that people are forced to go for a huge cost i am not ashamed to say i attempted suicide
my exwife is going to read this my exgirlfriend is going to read this my ex ex girlfriend is probably going to read this bad reddit habits on my part
there he has been treating me really bad hostile i would pretty much consider it bullying complaining about things criticizing etc
what about them i am shut down and do not want to talk with anyone this year i will learn to show no pain and start to show less care in their life
and now what nothing i am getting too close they did not offer much using cbt techniques tends to make me feel a lot worse actually
you do not realise how much love you wanted from them until you take a step back and realise how little they really gave you
it is dead to me nobody wants me nobody cares about me nobody wants to hug or kiss me and i feel cold walking outside in the winter air
your complete youturn personality in the case of relationships is not for me this was the nail in the coffin that i cannot be with you in the long run
she was the kind of person who did all that she could for anybody and never expected anything back she was amazing a great listener a great comforter she would always call me everyday or send me a text just check in and tell me about her day
i now think that the only reason we remained friends was because she did not want to feel as guilty but i do not know this for sure so who am i to assume
i give simple example i like to play osu or at least try to and there is a lot of maps of course
she is told me she is struggling too with all of this but she seems so happy and not even a little bit depressed
i am tired of this feeling though i want to feel something i am aware this post is going to upset some people and that my problem seems incredibly first world
i can not tell if i am experiencing teen angst or just realizing the reality of things or idfk maybe comfort or an explanation would be nice if you can even figure out wtf i just spewed out
we fucking talked about it and you just do not seem to care about me pouring my heart out you just do not care
i have also been following the lofi fenomena on youtube and i think it is amazing how people with a shared interest can gather and express positive ideas help each other and as i said at least vent their problems for a while in a healthy enviroment
it is a month in of the breakup and our lease ends in may 2021 a hopeful medical student but that seems further away day by day one of two sons
today is supposed to be a day i can spend happy and with family and yet despite that i have decided to spend the end of the day isolated and alone in my room i went for a walk but just ended up crying walking down the street
i had to come home two years later due to irreconcilable differences i left again a short time later to be with another girl at age thirty no less i have been with this one since if not for the disability laws we would be married now
i have reasonably serious depression anxiety some paranoia and trust issues these stem from a shitty childhood who has not got one of those right and a lot of bad experiences in life including constant and vicious bullying during most of my schooling i have gotten therapy for this and i am on medication for it as well and i can say that these things really do help and hinder a bit too but mostly help
even if i was alone it was nice to get out once in awhile this entire year has pretty much been spent in my bedroom around my house save for some shopping trips
so i stay at the hotel the whole time and utilize the hotel amenities he was initially much more into me than i was him as i was reserved about the age difference
i get panicky anxious over talking to people it is usually at certain times but whenever it happens i feel like i can not talk to people
i got a bit tired at one point and decided i would go to sleep he got up to kiss me and i tasted wine on his lips
it is been 2 weeks and i can not stop crying over him i am a huge dissapoitement to my family i can not get out of bed
maybe in the beginning yes but a year later no one would and my familys bloodline is also saved by my sister and her 3 children
usually stressful when i hear the phone ringmy boyfriend said the way i talk about kids he truly hopes i never have one
i have family which i am thankful for but i have no friends and no love any more no one who gets me
realising that if i did go through with this it would be potentially 34 weeks before family would call and wonder
and you do not remember life without those long periods of complete loneliness sometimes you can not even be fully present when you are with people you have loved
i love you i want you to hold me and tell me everything is going to be alrightthe 151 comments on the discussion tab explain the entire thing
inbetween all the crap in my life i have been learning various skills on internet all by myself whenever i could those were english language drawing animating programming composing music all that path and all the fighting through just to reach my age and realize that none of this really matter and the world actually works differently than i thought
i almost brought her to the er but she seemed to suddenly be sane whenever i decided that was only path
i felt i was entirely responsible for any emotion she was feeling at any given time if she had a bad shift and was short with me i would get insanely depressed anxious and desperate for some sort of validationvindication
but in a nutshell the reason was that we are incompatible so after discussing it we both reasonbly come to such a conclusion
taking pills just became my comfort even if after it my parents scream and yell at me getting angry for trying to kill myself but i really want to fucking do it the experience i have had in the hospital gives me comfort i could tell them what i wanted to say without it legitimately being therapy because my experience with therapists outside of the hospital is just not great
i just put on a smile keep my head up and remember there are still at least 36 people tops that do not piss me off most days
i used to be able to go out and sometimes meet new people in my town but that seems to have degraded to where i can go out for bike rides and talk to noone at all
it is been more than 8 months since my breakup and i have forgiven her for the heartbreak that she caused me to live thru for the last couple of months it probably still exists but i have learned to not look into that as much as possible
she is drinking everydayeven aloneand is not super stable we broke up so i no longer get a say in what she does
next close your eyes i want you to take a big and wide view from above imagine yourself staring at the world and all the shitstorms conglomerating on it from outer space observe the clouds the mountain tops and the valleys and hills below you
i am pretty conflicted by myself and crying right now it hurts to be so alone ignored staying only home working
the emotional pain is so overwhelming but i am alive and still breathing i have felt really depressed not getting out of bed or being productive with my days
both of my friends are slowly sorting out their lives in relationships and work and here i am by myself with a bottle of whisky and destiny
how do people deal with this shit and how do they not let it negatively impact them you have push the restart button of your life and now you are dating someone else
i was left feeling worthless and that my sexual experiences have ruined me for future partners i also feel completely disconnected from my sexuality and repulsed by the idea of it
if i told you that you can improve the social skills that you need in order to knowing always what to say and how to say it
am i wrong for being willing to do this know all of the toxicity that i have had to deal with and still am should i feel guilty about her friend
she looks at me like she is seen a ghost and i ask her questions and she never respond she just writes things down in front of me
i loved you and i still love you she was beautiful the way she smelled her eyes me being a stubborn prick i pushed her off me
the past few days i have been thinking of what i would put in a suicide note if i had to write one or how i would do it
i am constantly being left for another prettier girl this is how all my relationships go they always lose interest in me and find a better and prettier girl
i now know that i do not really like star wars that much because this friend likes it a lot and sends me all the time things about it but i am like
for example i could not find my mother in the house the other day and my brain automatically said she is gone if you know what i mean
the relationship was doomed i was not able to trust her again i started to be possessive which i never was before that and to argue with her without realizing i was giving up on the relationship my love then became an attachmment i now realize how distant we were when we had our last disagreement
but now it is just i feel content and happy every now and then and this hate for everything around me is the new norm
obviously the above will not apply 100 to everyone is individual situation but it can be tailored in a way you know best
i do not have any friends my school friend is not in touch with me for past 1 week no one is there for me when i am alone i feel like i do not have anyone to show my feelings and lie on them when i am sad
the reason i am choosing to not talk to him and open the wound is because i care we were surviving and there were peaks of happiness but we were not thriving
for 8 months or 9 by one person or two my 2nd scorned reject i have been so much so very much stalked in cyber tubes with extreme operation of evil of i am bored and i hate ty and he uses my reddit website let us ruin him
is this okay i do not think i can handle a reply or be left on read which he did to me after apologizing a week after but should i unblock and wait since the apology was for healingclosure on my part
on one hand i am super independent and i love being by myself often need more space to myself in fact i recently broke up with my boyfriend because i needed room to be by myself and build my life how i wanted among other things but on the other hand i feel so disconnected that something must be wrong with me
my mother even though she has depression herself could not understand that i was feeling terrible so she told me things i wish nobody has to hear them from their own parrents because well it felt like the ground under your feet was torn away from you
but you manage to wake up today and function i applaud you applaud the little things the reddit community is the only reason i made it to the end of 2020
i do not even know what else to say i am just too depressed to even think about it too muchi live alone i will not see anyone for at least 3 weeks now until they reassess the situation
you can also read about the vision for the final art exhibit on our website tldr it involves a lot of mirrors letters and an infinity of loneliness that creates community in the process
i just want to be happy mani do not want to make her feel like that again but it is so hard to keep fighting
my mother had been drinking in fact she recently started drinking again after taking a fourweek break she started having a mental breakdown while wrapping christmas presents
i could not focus on the conversation because of how suddenly worried i was and now i have picked at it to the point it hurts
i want a family and life but i can not do that while i still think it is possible with her i wanted her to tell me one last time that there was no chance for us
i am on the lash out and am triggered by not having an option to have a 5 minute normal talk over phone
we met at work and we are together pretty much the whole time she was here both city and company she got a new job elsewhere and we were planning on moving together but she ended it can give more deets if people want
i want to stop feeling so bad what do i do where do i go from here i am moving on but it seems like everything is happening at a god awfully slow pace and my borderline ass wants instant gratification in a relationship rn
she genuinely is a nice person but her histrionics are so irrational i am happy for her because i really do want her to be happy
i want to hear you say i love you to me again i want you to forgive me and give me one more chance
i knew this and i kept taking him back hoping he would change he knew how to manipulate me into feeling like i was the problem
i do not want us to never have contact again it is probably impossible due to zzzz and speaking of it would be considerate if you would not take your girlfriend with you on her birthday it would hurt really bad and in that way i know that you read that letter or it would be a coincidence but since i know your teaspoon of empathy it would be a quite big coincidence
i had a couple of people i was friendly with from my previous school but we do not hang out at all
i did not received answer in 1 amin and looked at her facebut the thing she still did not look at my finger
then the day she flies up it goes back to amazing just for the next half a week to be just as bad again
i can not even glimpse at social media anymore without getting jealous and wondering why soandso did not invite me to that or why that group of friends i have hung out with many times did not invite me out again
i do not want to put in effort for anything nor do i want to work i do not want to do the things that you are obligated to do within this world
i recently watched a home movie that was filmed september 18 2001 a week to the day after 911 when i was 3
i do not know why i react like this to things so simple as the ones i just said usually i would just get angry or frustrated but i would not cry about it let alone so easily
she stated that she is been at war with herself ever since and had not yet ended our relationship because she was too afraid to hurt me and feared that i would leave her life forever since i was her best friend i had told her before that since i loved her so much a breakup would destroy me and that i could never turn these feelings off and be friends with her
as per my usual birthday i pick a long weekend and try to get away somewhere different so i was off march 20th and march 23rd this year did not do much
i was always so active walking and travelling now it is a struggle to even get out of bed or take a shower i cannot imagine feeling like this for the rest of my life i feel so empty and a she will of the person i used to be also recently got laid off from my job so feeling even more worthless anyone in a similar a situation or have you been in my shoes
she just wanted me to give her attention as an ego boost the whole time while she goes and screws around with these chumps who do not know how to treat a woman
i have no idea what it is like and have no clue how to help i want to make it more bearable for him
he would often rant about how his colleagues are sabotaging him purposefully and say stuff in a way that made it seem like he is too good for our family and we are not deserving of him
i keep on calling him names like my little boy unironically we started calling each other mommy and daddy ironically at first but then it became our thing
why am i crying about him right now why am i even thinking about our good old memories i feel empty and lonely i feel hate and sadness
that was the last straw i wanted to die idk if any of you guys could help me that would be great and i would really appreciate it
i supported her when her grandfather passed and she felt she has no friendswhat do i do what should my parents do any advice is appreciated
the interview is entirely anonymous and nonidentifiable to protect your privacy during this interview you are free to skip any question you want
one of my alters ryzi gets panic attacks when my hair cut to stop the panic attack i took my proscription medicine for headaches
but if she did not then she needed to let me go because i know she has a new life and family on the way
and like i want to feel something but at the same time i feel too muchi feel empty but in pain and suffering at the same time
i totally gave up when i suggested something and my friends went out and did it without me since then i have been really exhausted dealing with relationships but also struggling with loneliness
i hope this fades away since maybe i am still processing the initial shock i just feel so alone in this feeling since i have no one to talk to about it
i just want her to take me back and most people say she will but today 2 people said she probably will not and i can not handle the thought
but unfortunately no matter how illogical and unreasonable my thoughts are about that i am still emotionally and sexually frustrated because of that and i am still bitter
i feel like i am always the one to ask people to hang out first or talktext people firstif you are able to spread the word that would be amazing
fix those uneven pieces and you will be able to connect or reconnect with the people in your life the thought itself is much more disjointed and chaotic but you get the picture yeah
i miss you so much but i am not ready to look at you yet i think i still miss you too much
i feel like when this pandemic is over i am going to have nobody despite earning enough from my parttime job i will not be able to travel because i have no friends
with that being the case i do things to keep myself from the depression of it but it is hard to deny at times when you see all of your friends either smashing left and right or are in relationships have fun and post shit together
i guess what i am asking is how do you cope with it because i know it is not my fault and i do not feel any guilt
i lost almost everyone because i am a lierand i just can not deal with ittherpay ist just one talk every weak even if you stay on the station the rest is just boardgames
finding a therapist has been a hell of a time and most of them have made me feel even worse about what i have going on
my world is on fire i just want it to stop loneliness loneliness loneliness is a complex and usually unpleasant emotional response to isolation
i do not regret my life i have done things a lot of people that most people would never get the chance to experience i have made my mark i have had more than my share of luck and rights and life has been good to me
i have no friends no one to talk to or that understands me no home no car i lost the woman of my life the children we would have her kid her house
i guess i will miss you but you can find someone better and be happier i am not good enough for you i have a lot of unsolved problems and i do not want to be a burden goodbye and take care of yourself i wish you the best
i have been nc for like 3 weeks and i decided to go to dating app and i saw him there this hurts pretty bad and today i scrolled and saw his name on social media and i was trying to block him but it says the content to no more longer this hurts me again
a week after our break up i tried talking to her about fixing this and she said she does not know what she wants right now does not know if she wants a relationship
mental illness became a thing to generate character depth to people a simple character trait that is free to claim for everyone to have
i am alone in a bar after a particularily tough shift the same day l was back home he was already on tinder meeting new girls in my country
so he broke up with me and said many things like maybe in the future we will get together when we are older and more mature or maybe it is not the right time where we started dating
feel free to direct message me about rates if you are interested hope to meet you soonok so i know that my loneliness is entirely my fault
i would be done with me too tbh hello folks my so is depressed after the unfortunate passing of her mother as one can understand
i am fucking 18 and can not speak out without stumbling and stuttering forget elaborating concepts which i know i am sick of just consuming bullshit and being unable to react to it because of my stupidity
we spent every day of covid together and summer and in general were just best friendswell i just relapsed again today of all days
so i went to a drugstore and bought the strongest sleeping pills i could get my hands onnet and various toolrelated sites like everyday
i also detest the idea of someone having pity over that stuff call it insecurity okay few things would make you feel inferior or inadequate as effectively as someone pitying your solitude or trying to oh poor thing you i am not inferior i just have a problem that i do not know how to solve
i am tired of feeling like a let down tired of being alone and feeling like my phone is of no use because no one texts me
been through depression now i think i am out of the red zone but i still identify as such and that might be why i can not move on to my life
then for a couple days i thought about how i would really feel being in a relationship where i was expected to put in timeaffection without it being consistently reciprocated and i felt terrible
it is given me extreme anxiety and abandonment issues i always think people will leave me in relationships and sometimes i think i push them away and self sabotage unintentionally
but that is what i needed i took out all that poison out of me as i said i was feeling safe every single person at the yale new haven hospital made me feel safe for the first time i felt i was not fighting alone like there is real help outside real people who take care of you and can help you for the first time i felt there is another exit a better exit a one that you do not walk alone
how is that can be closeness if i am not able to do anything i am very kind person or used to be so i decided to stay with him
eventually she started to give me the look just the thought has me completely broken and lost i can not imagine myself with anyone but him
this is the first time this has happened that he is actually sprung another relationship so my natural reaction is to reach out to this lady 30f and tell her the full story that he would probably try to spin off to benefit himself
i will post this rant on this subreddit and rdepression this will most likely not get read so i feel like there is no use even writing this long rant
i try not to drink much but will still give in once a week or so i miss my girlfriend too i have known her since we were twelve
i felt like the bubble of isolation had popped i reached out to a friend i had once lent 600 about possibly paying since if it back
i am 24 year old girl i have always had troubles making friends all my life but recently this has become unsustainable
my best friend of ten years is gone everyone i knew in the past is gone my family is beginning to hate me
it is perfectly possible i will feel fine again in a day or so but eventually i will end up here again in this pit of despair i know that noone on this earth feels good all the time sometimes things are just bad it is simple as that but this can not continue
it is not a job i wanted i fought 10 years to avoid having to do this but here i am i hate god
i sometimes feel happy when i am with other people but i can not fully depend on that after a while they need space and i get that
anyone have any strategies you have found to make things better1 reach out to old friends you have not talked to in a long time call someone up
general anxiety and social anxiety and i tend to get 12 week long depressive episodes every 12 months i do not understand how he could just throw me away like that we were best friends
not sure how to go about on this but every time i am alone by myself i just can not stop thinking about how lonely i am and that i have no friends
i decided that in order to make my mother happy get a good job and make maybe something of my life i decided to just accept that i will be forever a loner person
i do not think i was ever meant to be happy i do not want to stop fighting for the people i love and cherish
i guess she did not feel the same i do want to be friends with her eventually but i am really hurt she could move on so quickly and i am not sure i would be able to keep my composure if we talked
he tells me i am the only reason he can keep going and i am the only reason he is gotten help and that he is attempted to harm himself recently
i am 20 years old this year forgive my bad sentence it is nothing like it use to be but i guess that is the point
we do not have anyone with because we are the outcasts of both sides of the family no one helped us but ourselves because we need to survive
i go back and forth between hostile and depressed is this bipolar disorder i have violent thoughts and fantasize about hurting people too sometimes
so a person with a masters degree oops i did it again sorry for mentioning it is supposed to beg a chick fil a walmart supermarket to hire me for 12hr or less
easily my biggest trigger for my anxiety is yelling and my mother tends to yell a lot so all the time at home i was suffering with panic and heart palpitations and it sucked
i do not get out of bed or out of my pjs i spend hours endlessly on sims or animal crosisng because they feel like the most stimulating thing to me right now
it is christmas and everyone seems to be so happy but every day i feel more alone i have holidays now but the days on which i go to school are not any better
write down who was responsible next to each item who was at the heart of that if you are feeling really weak now you might think it is all your fault but i really want you to think about this
it is not like i could go to them anyway because i do not get invited not to mention my huge social anxiety that came along with my aspergers
that is all thank you for giving me your attention this evening someday i might miss you but i sure do not miss you right now
but then i read his texts where he told me that he wants his freedom that he does not care if i am hurt i have to deal with it
her ipad had her passcode on the screen and i read her last messages to her friends apparently she wanted to mount him and i ruined what could have been a magical night
i celebrated a year of sobriety last month but i am now feeling myself losing hope and wondering what the point is of life in general
i have no money no job no assets my parents have no money they are in so much debt that i can not help them with
she said she loved me but she can not get over the scars that i have created even though i tried my best to be a better person for her
it was right back to despair and sorrow everything is becoming nothing i have been given a few diagnoses from my doctor but i have never seen anyone regularly
i have had other online friends that are female that i have never made feel this way but on this discord i made a few of them feel uncomfortable
i have been googling quickest and easiest ways to do it and a way to do it that will not traumatise too many people because i do not want to hurt anybody
everyone has become super polarized hyper partisan and a lot of people have fallen into fringe conspiracy theory all leaving me extremely concerned for my loved ones and feeling very isolated as a single man
also jus started a job n i am havin to call in sick on my second day because of having a temperature n that i feel propa shit abt it
life is not for everyone it is like college either you pass or you failit took me years to understand this but now i know
its fizzled and my stupid ass is sitting here crying about someone who probably did not think much of me other than a warm body to be with
it explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent even an innocent message like if you are 100 committed i will just wish you peace is likely to increase peoples pain and why it is important to report even subtle prosuicide comments
i feel unloved and unlovable i have not been shown any physical love or affection in years no interest intimacy no comfort
it is tough because i miss him a lot but again i am tired of that life i want a partner that will equally stick up for me and make it obvious that he cares about spending quality time with me and getting to know the important people in my life has anyone had a similar experiencehave any advice for me thank you so much and sorry for the long rant
i am scared that i am a narcissist because i do have moments where i think i am better than everyone else around me but then a few moments later i get humbled once i look in the mirror i am not sure if this is a god complex or mania but i literally go crazy and feel like i am multiple different people
but of course my mom made me feel really bad about myself because i started crying and she told me to get over it which is what she says to me every time i cry
i am an extreme over thinker sometimes what helps me come down is asking the person i am overthinking ab or the thing but sometimes i regret it or the answer they gave me is not what i hoped for
i gave him the phone and left when i called him later he was mad at me for reading his phone
i have not been happy since my age was single digits i do not even remember what it is like to be happy anymore
after a chain of events that happened during the last 6 months of 2019 i decided i needed to be open minded about mental health and realize things are more complex than they appear
i asked him about it and at first he was fine and sugar coated and said he loves me and all that i questioned him further and he freaked out and was super defensive he asked how i could believe that bitch over the time loyalty and love he has given me
i went on a mormon mission right after graduation because why the fuck not and it was there that i was able to gain a huge ton of social skills
she was so cold in our relationship for the last 6 or so months she was struggling to make up her mind about whether to stay or leave the second time she brought it up and i thought id be kinder by telling her she should go
it was a guy who i slightly admired and looked up too he was 16 and i was 14i thought i liked girls i do like girls but i also like both
my godmother is my neighbours daughter her mother and mine would be quite close and we known eachother my whole life
he never worked at a job that paid much either it seems on the occasions i would see him or talk to him
3 should i show her that i am better off without her4 will she forget about me and the things i did if i do not come back too soon
today i was thinking about me having no friends and it became clear to me that i obtain pleasure from thinking such thoughts i mean it is not a pleasure to have no friends and being lonely but i caught myself on that i do feel satisfied being sad about being lonely it is very subtle but i think it is actually like kind of a swamp
they surely would not blame you for having thoughts because everybody thinks and they would surely be used to having their power of telepathy
for a while things seemed to get better at a company retreat but on the night of the final day he was colder than ice she had gone to return his tab that he had borrowed her and he had asked her to leave his room then they seemed to get better again and again he switched up on her
the bottom line is that i am not happy and i want to finish things off i am not interested in any other girl either i just want to focus on myself and be happy
he is pushed me to self harm many times if i am not able to bring something to the table i am a mere afterthought
i could not laugh even if i tried sounds crazy right i probably deserve this tho i think i still miss you too much i miss your kindness and your comfort
it is like he is telling me he will do it again and i should accept his demise soon i can never do it
i made another post regarding my breakup story already so i will not go over that again these thoughts are almost always negative thoughts i am extremely pessimistic
sometimes i did get lonely but i have demonized him in my mind so much to help feel better that it was not him in particular that i missed but rather the romantic company of someone in general
i tell her how emotionally draining and unhopeful i was after that experience we decide to hold off on bipolar medications and continue to treat the adhdadd
i really want do jump but as soon as i actually get there it just seems silly and i feel like i am faking it but as soon as i get back home it feels like a missed opportunity and i get stuck in my own head and just want it to stop
skipping to my freshman year of high school i remember looking up what could have been causing my speech problems while still completely ignoring that feeling in my head that became a normal part of my life
i aim to go live by myself as soon as i can afford it i am hoping that will help but i will still have family people i have to interact with at work and i will still have the normal human desire to have friends and maybe a relationship
i do not even have enough motivation to call a doctorall i can do is sleep to avoid being conscious but that is starting to not be enough anymore
i go through phases where i feel like i am okay but then i realize that we will likely form a new life without any hints of the other he will go out find girls attractive flirt with them sleep with them date them etc and eventually i suppose i will too but the thought of both of us doing things with other people that we promised to do with each other forever stings
so it is almost like i am a spy that needs to fitin and not look suspicious and that is the main reason why i am seeking a relationship which is really cynical
it is only been a day and a half but i miss him more than i could have ever imagined i could more than i did when we spent a month apart
my ex still follows me on everything i blocked him on snapchat and unfollowed him on spotify so i will not stalk his activity and whenever i join discord calls we in quarantine still so that is our main way of interacting with friends he will respond to things i say for example i will be joking with my friends we share a friend group like wow that reminds me of you to like a stupid meme or something and he will respond to me like damnnnn or something along those lines
i did not experience major trauma i did not have big hardships in life i feel so selfish and miserable for being the way i am
i have not talked to her in a little over 2 years she cheated on me while my mom died in the hospital
he was really really dead silent to me so i assume because in the pass i use to be annoying to him so i assume he muted me
today i went to one of their dorms but i felt so annoying knocking on her door idk what to do
the pain you feel when the person you love turns into a stranger again is incredible it can either destroy you or fix you i thought about giving up
i do not know if this is because for concern but i practice witchcraft and believe in faeries psychic abilities etc but simultaneously know they are not really real i honestly do not know
my lack of self has made me so self conscious and weak to the point where i hate interacting with people i do not want them to know and then have their reactions confirm my worst insecurities it is a self fulfilling prophecy i know i look for things to confirm my bias but i can not break myself out of this negative cycle i hate myself too much
do not know if anyones ever watched the tv series his dark materials but the show features people who have deamons animals that can communicate with them and are a part of them always by their side i am so lonely that i wish i had a demon of my own mainly so i could talk to and connect with it
i am alone i am not a good person i have tried to be but i am not not in my nature to be a good person people drift away from me and leave no one cares no ones going to care i am no longer under any delusion that anythings going to change especially not from this shitty reddit post
my dad would never talk to me and my mom would scold me again if i ever bring the topic of relationships
a lot of gruisum things happened as i was young that i do not feel comfortable mentioning but i will say this i still have nightmares
i can change even you said i do not need to because you loved me like i was i am better now i am fighting to be better
pretty sure i have corona gettin tested today for it but seems like i have iti have a great job wonderful friends wonderful husband and dog but i am wishing i had more close friendships
how would that be my fault when i did try if anyone has any advice or even just relate to what i am saying that would be really appreciated
lately i have been skipping school more often just because it gets to much sometimes not the content of the classes but the fear that when i have to answer something and it is wrong that i will emberise myself
thirdly do you think it is okay to just almost semi reset my online lifei feel like this is the turning point of my life and most of my recent life has been online and i want to only take forward those who have helped me
does anyone suffer from audio hallucinations my therapist thought i am talking about voices in my head no i just here things
but things did not really get much better after that the new school in that other small city has been filled with bad people other school too as well as a few colleges i have changed after that
i am feel like i am dying inside and i need to get out of my head but it is impossible i feel worthless and so unwanted my heart aches beyond belief i do not know how to get better
right now i am pretty happy with self collection of articles and videos from school of life site and youtube channel i wish they had that knowledge in app form
i know he loved me or maybe loves me and i do too but we had to end it because it was too malignant for both of us
worse is i do not know how i can deal with it and it comes and goes is there something wrong with me i am not really sure how to approach myself on this
he always compares me and other friends to the enneagram descriptions he gets his daily mails i feel like he does not see me as an individual anymore but always tries to find truth in the enneagram furthermore he so we think adjusts his behavior unconsciously to that of what the enneagram says according to the enneagram he thinks he is the reformer type one perfectionism
i have the desire but i live in so much fear and shame my brain and body fight me so much i get tired
most of the doctors i met told me that probably it is my mental issues that are causing me pain and physical discomfort
throughout this she was being very patient and helpful to me and trying to help me work through everything i knew i fucked up and i wanted to improve
they are engaged they bought a house and she goes to the gym i used to go to i think they might live in the town she and i lived in
feeling worthless and inadequate is expected after virtually any breakup where is the limit how do i know i have exhausted everything
but when she did write to me and when i called her on her birthday she felt and sounded so emotionless like she killed me from her heart
one day you no longer have to force yourself to do things you used to together one day you will be able to do it on your ownwatch the shows play the games eat all the foodwithout missing him
how can he play happy families with the woman he cheated on me with putting up christmas trees and acting like they did not leave me broken playing happy family with her child and calling him daddy while i sit and wonder why our 8 year relationship was not enough why i was not enough what does she have that makes her better than me
i am went into my room to get away from my dad and this is probably where i will be staying for a while
this dehumanizing empty feeling you made me feel these last couple of months and then again these last couple of days is something i do not want anyone to feel ever
after this year being a complete shit a few weeks ago i was told it was very likely that due to an overdose i was going to have major heart issues and possibly die
my family is getting together for a small thing9 people i have bad social anxietyyes even with my family needless to say we are having a partyright now as i am writing and i am exhausted and nervous i do not know what to do because i feel like i could breakdown at any point
this all happened when i was around and between the ages of 713 i developed an eating disorder as well as acid refluxgerd which both of them deny i have i frequently had sleep paralysis and nocturnal seizures in middle school and now i sleep horribly waking up several times during the night waking up early trouble falling asleep etc i am also underweight and my grades have been slipping
i am extremely angry that was first and last time i ever saw him crying so i did not break up with him
i have always held on because of my parents but with my mom on her way out my time is limited anyway i do not want to leave my sister alone but we have an older brother that will take her in if he has to my birthday is in early april and 30 seems like the perfect time to finally do it and then i will not make the anniversary of my fathers passing
i am not sure i would even take him back at this point i mean i love him but the way he went about this just was so cruel and it really really sent me into a dark place
what is so tiring is that i genuinely do not want to lose hope i do not want to give up on life and being happy yet whenever things seem to start getting better something always happens and my happiness just comes crashing down i do not know what to do anymore and i do not have an out i am so tired and lonely i do not know what to do
2 years later she divorced me precisely for those reasons i tend to fear people or resent them mental illness can be very strange and frightening
what do you guys do with the thoughts you want to share with someone on a deeper level but can not because you are alone
it pisses me off that i have these thoughts while over people go through so much and are so much stronger
i felt like he did not try anymore for the relationship after 5months and i was the one who tried all the time with trying to keep things fun and interesting
i have asked him to block me in the past and i asked him again last night he told me he would stay away but he still has not blocked my messagesdeleted my contact
so recently i have rekindled something with my ex and it is been a weird situation the past 2 years we have been separated
i am dumb and depressed now and maybe i am just crazy and no medication is going to help me i have been diagnosed and tested for all kinds of mental health issues and i am just crazy
i just want to talk about this somewhere with this throwaway account i dunno man it was my fault for online dating but it came so suddenly we were together for a year and i did not think she would just ghost me for 3 months and her first message once she came back would be a breakup paragraph
things were not great it is been a stressful year but i was hoping to reset as a couple in 2021 i am genuinely shocked i spent today getting drunk calling friends and being a shit to my family
i just feel so depressed about all the circumstances i logically understand i am home and should be thankful for the time with family and my boyfriend but i can not distract myself from the bad things
every single day in these nine months i see a nightmare involving god in one way or another i had prophesy dreams nightmares about god seeing biblical prophets and mohamed or a completely normal dream but there is an angel in the sky or i do not have a dream but each time i wake up scared even if i see nothing
i wanted to do it on my own so i was still not transparent with her but i truly was getting on the right track
i do not feel wanted and i feel like i am always the backup plan i just want to be wanted for me and for my company to be appreciated
i have tried meds done a lot of inner work spiritual work as well i am just not so sure why i find it so difficult to make a friend
nobody checks in on me nobody puts in any effort i am pathetic mediocre at best and have no future to speak of
my ex broke up with me 12 weeks ago because she did not love me anymore even though she still had a lot of affection for me i am 28 she is 26
i know a lot of people here say they have no friends i can say that with the exception of one person who i consider my best friend mostly because she is the only friend i can confide in i do not socialize with anyone else
but slowing she started to go out with the others and not even telling me she would spend the whole break outside smoking since she knows i do not do any of that
for so long i truly believed that as miserable as i am now things could changei am so tired of waking up everyday and pretending like shit is going to change
i like to tell my friends i never want to lose them and they say the same to me but i would never tell them they are selfish for having the thoughts they do and vice versa
now here i sit in front of the monitor with destiny 2s home screen just sitting there with no one to play with
it has become to a point where i can not even watch porn or masturbate because i get overwhelmed by sadness and anger
we were helping each other with everything and now i am all alone i have family which i am thankful for but i have no friends and no love any more
instead of saying to yourself i am a failure you can say i am ok everyone failed at some point i am going to fail again in the future probably but il try to fail better
i made a google form that people can submit and share their breaking point during covid or if covid ever impacted their mental health
i do not quite feel like me like i am an observer looking out like shits happening and i am here but am i really doing it
ultimately if there is one nugget of wisdom that i want to leave you with it is this your ex is an ex for a reason and she is far from healthy
i try to meditate but the only thing i can think about is wanting to take that cancer out of her and put it into me to let it grow and take everything for me
each fight it is always about that and each time he just says so many words yet never has actions for any of them
i know myself i was never good at handling breakups so when you are single maybe think about answering my letter
you would never know i am completely dying inside not just emotionally but my fucking heart does not have anything left to give i have searched indefinitely for an ounce of comfort compared to the pounds that i give
i was completely immersed in that relationship that i lost myself in that relationship you may be able to relate to these feelings
this makes me want to leave something scathing and hurtful in the note towards him something to scar him for life beyond just the loss of his son
this whole years been ass for me and my family like my parents split up i got involved in some bad stuff not like i did illegal stuff but like i caused more complications in my family and i just hate my entire family more and more each day and i guess that is because of hormones and shit and also because i get annoyed and mad easily but genuinely i fucking hate every single one of my family members
i am so so far past my breaking point and my brain and body can not take any more i need to release them and free them from the suffering
how can a therapist help me and convince me that the invisible punishment did not happenwill not happen or that gods do not accept those promises
how can i learn about the postattempt process so i know what the best guidelines are how can i help her on the path to recovery are there any good books or apps or resources where i can find advice and wisdom
the thing is when i am cycling to my room from the class buildings i see people walkingdrinkinghaving fun together or making friends whit people they just met so easily
please read to the end no i am not psyhopatid like to believe its hallucinations but i seee soooooooooo much things which just can not be hall
we had a time where we hooked up and i had always wanted to be with her more than just a hookup
but somehow i still get butterflies when his name pops up on my phone when he laughs even when he is being a dick and teasing me
do i just cut her off completely and go no contact since it is already been 3 to 4 days even though this is killing me or do i try to reach out to her again i keep telling myself she is probably just keeping me on the hook but i still try to hold onto hope
i am not suicidal but i am becoming a lot more apathetic of my decisions as they mean less to me if i can not control them
an hour passed until i became numb still have the blade on my right hand aimed at my left wrist but i still could not do it
he told me he had all the right to explore new option since l betrayed him that he could not forgive me or work it out due to distance
i have been crying for almost 9 hours straight and i have not slept i am a single dad and have a young son who does not know what is going on
i always have to make the first move i who have been reduced as just someone she shares a roof with
i just can not shake the feeling of hopelessness made worse by my own mind convincing me that the only way i will find what i am looking for is that special person to simply appear or of nowhere choosing me before i have a chance to even think about choosing her and that if that fantasy can not happen then there really is no hope for because doing things the normal way and putting myself out there at all will always inevitably fail and the being vulnerable will always have been for nothing
literally all i want to do is shower and go to sleep and eat and watch a show and do it all over again maybe i am in a slump as i often crave the time to write and draw and read and play games or whatever but now that i have the timemotivation is gone
some days i move forward and i am very good yet it is ultimately her cruelty which has made me become so kind and it is her emotional stabs that have forced me to love myself and respect myself enough to cure my own anxieties so in a very weird and strange way i am kind of thankful for all of this
or there might be a party or like right now a religious festival so lunch will become a normal meal dinner will be a normal meal
i really hope she has some sense to recognize that i am not a lying conniving person i just know that i can not do those things or at least that is what i tell myself
i try to but it is so hard to relate to people anymore even as just a friendwhat are your thoughts on this have you ever been surrounded by friendsfamilycoupleclassmates and yet still feel lonely
my theory is that it might be a due to selfisolation in preparation for christmas and new year my mom has forced me to completely selfisolate i have not seen anyone outside of family in a little over two weeks i would consider myself to be extremely extroverted and i have felt more emotional in other times i have had to quarantine myself but not nearly this much
i figure skate but have not made any friends for the past year i want to kill myself i try so hard but i just fail every time
i tried to be really cool with it but started to become increasingly uncomfortable with their relationship as she would often contact him about relationship problems and sometimes even call him in the middle of the night
it is unhealthy but i can not stop myself from checking to see if she is done something on there because i just feel so insignificant compared to these guys
i hate saying this because i know it is wrong and fucked up but i am jealous of my sisters happiness same goes for the few friends i have left
i have considered telehealth but every place i have found wants about 200 per week and thanks to my mental health and a toxicunsafe work environment i have not been able to get a job since june
i told them how i felt in little words and they cried on the phone with me asking me to stay put and helped me come up with short term solutions for my debt until i can recover financially
writing this just gave me a tiny amount of relief is all would be great if someone could share some semi painless ways to end my life
and as who she really was slowly unraveled and we broke up all i can do now is thank god we did not get married or have kids
treated me the woman i deserved to be i could feel the smile radiating as he was giddy in introducing me to his family friends
i do not care about scholarships because i can not get myself to think about money everything feels very far away and disconnected except for my friend and my boyfriend
there is one problem when it comes to love it is often overidealized and overhyped do not get me wrong it is useful and necessary but prioritizing it as a god value will make you do some incredibly fucked up shit here let me paint a picture for you
i am 19 and did something i regret horribly a few months ago but do these mistakes define me as unworthy incompetent or simply a bad person of course not
now everything is ruined and i threw away something beautiful because of my own personal doubts and anxieties it is hard to move on when i do not even feel like i want to
then she just did not answer my phonecalls she did not talk to me while i was trying to show that i do my best to repair what i though i broke she still used my acounts but the night before yesterday i found on her facebook profile she was talking with someone else like if she would talk to me a few months earlier
i deleted all my pics of her today we dated for a little over a year and broke up about two weeks ago
i do not even know what i am describing i have wanted for years to break out of the life i live but i do not know how
i am not the type of person to vent to strangers on the internet but i m in a really rough spot right now and in need for someone to listen to me
people tell me i got to reach out in a crisis i bet you have heard that too so i did it made things worse and i am at the end of my rope
my case was a misdemeanor charge no fines or bond was even chargedso i just got broken up with my girlfriend of 10 months
ich kann das nicht mehr wie soll ich 24 stunden am tag diese qualvollen nervenschmerzen ertragen ich kämpfe nur noch für meine mutter ich hatte einen qualvollen geburtstag und jetzt qualvolle weihnachten ich habe tausende euros füare ärzte ausgegeben habe aber nie eine sinnvolle diagnose erhalten mein leben dreht sich nur noch um diese unerträglichen kopfschmerzen wie soll ich weitermachen
naturally i was hurt but given how my situation was when this started i stayed open minded and gently confronted her about it
i am trying to fill my time but it is been weeks and every single night i go to bed without talking to you hurts
but now i sit here on my bed crying my eyes out the type where you curl into a ball because your heart hurts so much and you just feel so much pain
i do my best not to react on my emotions and at times try to force myself to laugh or something but i just get flashbacks to those years at school and i just feel more worse than i should be feeling
i have only been in 2 relationships and the longest one was 3 months people always leave no matter what i do
cut to the next day and she is upset i actually friended him and tells me she is not happy it would affect my family and their friends so like
if you are in need of a chat to vent rant or get anything off your chest my pms are always always open for you
i try so hard and i am never the one i am always the second option in the end of course he did the right thing and chose to stay with his fiancé
i want to feel loved again already though i want to be appreciated and have a romance again and know that someone is there for me i miss having someone dating apps clearly though have not worked for me and it just feels pointless but it is not like i am going out places to meet people so it is my best option i suppose i just do not know if i should wait longer or how long
being lonely makes me want to go online and pretend to be someone i am not it makes me want to do things that i should not
i would like to choose death finally people have told me if you were really going to commit suicide you would just do it already
you can think that they are going to be there forever but you will never know until that day come you have to let go
today was good in terms of things that happened in my personal life but fuck i am so alone and sick of feeling like this
it is like i just want really badly for someone to just be there for me i guess and let me pretty much bawl my eyes out
we agreed it was best to split i literally only today symphysed with all the people who get addicted to certain stuff it is definitely not easy
i do not want to be that guy that gets offended by everything and i want to be able to take on the toxicity without reacting negatively to it and potentially repelling people from me i have been dealing with this problem for years now help
now obviously the incels and the niceguys are much much more dangerous and toxic than the women that belittle some men for being too nice it is not even close
she came to me today and told me she needed to break up with me for a while i was completely blindsided because we were doing so well she told me she was scared i was becoming codependent which i honestly saw i did not really have anyone else i could hang out with my family does not do much together so i get it
does anyone have any tips on what they do to avoid the urge to messaging their ex or just on how to make the grieving process easier i feel as if he has no feelings sometimes because of how quickly he was able to move on and have nc with me
i am fucking tired of that everybody can find love bullshit i mean yeah love is not just sex and sex is not just beauty but for gods shake it is not good for anyone to deny it is an enormous part of it for almost everybody and guess what not everybody can get what they want
you read my messages but you are silent you have not blocked me my first thought was to write her stopping to try to initiate any contact but i know it better
i have noticed that as i grow up i have just generally stopped being happy about things more like i have just stopped caring about almost everything
it is not that i wished illwill on any of them but i always seemed to degrade them and think that they are people without any dignity or shame because they perform sexacts in front of a camera for money
we would rather know what is going to happen than be treated with respect and worth we literally give up being given what we deserve because we would rather know we are getting what we do not deserve
i came home drunk my dad had gone to atlanta for the night so i thought he would stay and be gone
the feeling was so intense whenever i tried to calm my mind down and i realized that it was just like all those other unrealistic solutions i made up while playing overwatch ever since i screwed up meditation it is like it just did not work anymore like it was placebo
at times i fear i am an incredibly toxic person without realizing it and i just want to fucking know man i am so fucking exhausted
to which she replied jesus christ i did not ask for the long version i just wanted a yes or a no
everyone was already in other matters and i was not prepared for anything at alli know how to tie a noose but hanging is fucking painful
everything is already very foggy and my memory is not very good but i am scared really scared especially to sleep is there any name for this or anyway to helpstop this thank you for your time have a great day
there is literally nothing else i want to do more than to talk to him and get some answers she literally said she does not really even like my face and she just wants to punch it
excuse my venting this is the only place where i can share my story i have not told anyone about my breakup and i hope it stays a secret for a while
i have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and i feel like my ssri pills dolin 15mg inst helping me at all
you might imagine yourself sitting on a hill seeing each thought as a cloud passing overhead and passing over the horizon
we were surviving and there were peaks of happiness but we were not thrivingi feel like she got herself together at my expense
do not know if was on purpose but i got so pissed off i am up i am out i am going to enjoy the last bit of my xmas eve
i could feel my emotions building up for a while but just did not have the energy to cry until last night
i have gotten to the point where i have made peace with dying the truth is at my core i am dead and i have been that way for a long time
additionally many of my grandparents have passed i do not plan on having children and i honestly do not see a large gathering in my future
so currently it is late night almost the wakey hour and i have not slept and i used to talk to her at this time and i can not help but notice a huge fucking hole in my heart and i can not mend it
i loved her with everything i had then we met in person i could feel the smile radiating as he was giddy in introducing me to his family friends
i do not know where to post what or how i am feeling and i do not know if this is the right sub
i would just like to say that i am not into animals sexually and i would never do anything sexual to my dog
when i moved i had huge problems finding myself around and talking to other people due to the fact i was foreign and my spoken language was not very good
m26 63 diagnosed bipolar type 2 severe anxiety and severe depressioni made a separate account for this post to avoid people looking down upon me
we both ended up picking ourselves but i would be lying if i said i was not still hoping for a different outcome i know it is fucked up but i hope you will realize that i am the one you need that being without me was a mistake that you do want to improve for yourself for us to work i know that is stupid but my heart misses you so much
yeah my family will feel bad but guess what i am not going to be around or exist to feel any other emotion or know what happens is that selfish yeah but fuck it
for 6 years i have always had someone around to talk to lay next to come home to share expenses with to do activities with
it is been a difficult year for everyone from the pandemic to how we now interact with each other on the daily basis
i have followed every productivity tip in the book every bit of advice i have been told that sometimes you just got to jump right in and wing it and i tried to
i just really need help but i do not want my parents knowing i took acid can anyone please give me advice
after three weeks of being togther i could notice something was off so we went on a walk oneday and she broke news to me
she then asked if i wanted to take a ride around to get away from my uncle so she brought my boots and bag up and i put them on before running downstairs to the front door still crying and upsetunable to breath properly
in a way the quarantine was good for me because everyone was alone together but soon everyone else will be out again
i am scary lookingby birth i have hated my physical appearance since i was in kindergarten the students i was with then hated it as well
not bragging it just does not track with some of the other experiences on here if things were so good why do i feel a psycological pain that feels like its just above my head i have had mild anxiety my whole life and felt jittery but now it feels like my limbs crackle with energy but at the same time they feel as if there are weights keeping them from moving
today i finally snap i can not pay my bills parents treat me like shit all i can do now is cuddle with my sweatshirt that smells like her and cry
i hate whenever this happens especially the aftermath just feeling numb and completely exhausted not knowing what to do to cheer myself up
guys freedom it is the most valuable thing in the world do not let anyone take it from you because if the take your phone you can always buy other one
so only being able to see him maybe once a month was really going to suck basically i am struggling hard with this break up
thought what it would be like if everyone was as depressed as me which hurts i just can not help but feel worried all of the time now
we have been together since my junior year of highschool and we have been doing long distance ever since covid has made our lives hell and we just could not be who each other needed at the time
but because of the fucking pandemic the schools are going to be mostly online so meeting people will be way harder
i still send him funny memes idk how to stop myself from sending him stuff even though he will look and not respond
my grandma died last year on christmas and even though that day was extremely painful she was still alive up until that morning
part of my mental illness is thinking that there is something wrong with me mu dad always treated me like i was not enough and made me feel like no one would ever love me i was abused sexually as a child and he abused me verbally and emotionally i seem to have been abused most of my life
i have felt depressed for a few weeks i drove my car to big sir today i am staying here tonight and doing it tomorow morning i have been a redditor forever so this felt like the best place to put it
i hope it helps because life feels like some twisted cycle only death can free me from sorry to be so morbid
she also has my card in her purse but i can snag it one day and she will not notice if it goes missing to be honest
let us say that your exgirlfriendboyfriend cheated on you with your best friend now you probably value loyalty to some degree but you value love way more
of course i never would have entered this relationship if this was how it started i know there is a honeymoon stage but this is a little different
my thoughts are i hate myself or i should not be doing this noware they real should i let them pass or will ignoring them make them worse
how do you guys cope with extreme loneliness most of the time i can deal with it watching soccer and playing video games or whatever but sometimes is so fuckin crushing like a void in my soul i wonder too much with my thoughts going through impossible scenarios i have to force myself to stop because i fear i am going crazy
however recently on a call to my mum she brought up that my ex stoped responding to her texts and calls awhile ago
i just am very insecure and make stupid scenarios of him leaving me and stuff like that or i take things he says or acts the wrong way
i have kind of been lonely for most of my life so why would i not give it a chance i am not delusional but i am not dating someone so they can hide their insecurities in me
tldr i think i might be a really bad person to my friends this was in the early 2000s when most high schoolers were still on desktops
nothing dramatic happened he is still my best friend and i do not know how to just move on from my best friend even though i know the relationship is not right i still care about him a lot
i hated intimacy with my boyfriend of 3 years starting about a year and a half ago they show off their clothing and style and they all get good grades
i just feel so absolutely worthless that i fuck up a retail position when these types of positions are deemed easy i made great progress on my ocd the past 23 years but now i feel like i am going to regress because i need to triple check sometimes 20 check everything at the store now which is not only embarrassing but just not viable as i can not have customers sitting at the register for 12 minutes while i constantly go over the same items
i know that i should be dedicating this time to work on myself as an individual and i am but it is hard when i am losing hope that i will find love again
but i still feel the same it is so hard to see the small light at the end of the tunnel
ik sometimes things are harder said than done but remember life has so many ups and downs but that is what makes life life in 5 years you will not care so take 5min and be sad but then pick up you are head bcs you are crown is falling plz stay and if you are thinking about not staying plz dm me i will not judge sometimes you need someone to talk and if you need someone to talk about anything no matter what plz plz dm me i am so proud of each and everyone of you who is reading this keep fighting
they talk about their mothers not teaching them to cook properly yet i never even had a mother i do not know how i am going to love anyone else
one of these days i will truly just stop just take a step off of the train platform or walk off a cliff
i have noticed that when i start eating lunch or dinner i begin to get waves of anxiety and panicky thoughts would you happen to know what causes this and does anyone else have this issue
that was the first time in a long time i have had any kind of substantial conversation with anyone and the first time in a long time someone is shown physical interest in me even if it was aggressive and unwelcome and to be honest even over a month after the fact it makes me feel sick inside like this was some kind of cruel prank
i was not always welcomed because i did not fit in my background and race often confused people or even pushed them away
i have a severely disabled sibling who can not talk so my parents spend all day either working to support the family or taking care of him
i have even became that desperate that i defeated my timidity and anxiety to try to go out and talk to others but after i have been told by one that good girls belong to rich guys only i even gave up on that
i tried to go back but every time i go i get an anxiety attackwhy did it have to be him of all people why him
i am talking japanese dorito packenging with some dude getting kicked in the balls and my mom is like uh what the hell
i need your help i launched a study about social isolation mediated through music and art and am in desperate need of participants it would mean the world to me if you would be able to take part in the survey so if you find yourself with some spare time and an inkling of curiosity about sound art and their effect on loneliness please head over to the link below
does the pain ever get better after a break up do you ever get back together do the bad thoughts ever go away i can not admit to the bad the thoughts i never have i really want her back
she does not want to see me she ignored my plea to speak to her daughter and basically does not even want to be friends
even though i do not feel very close to them i know how much they are good people and what they did for me
i wish i could go back and never make a reddit account or any social media being online makes my mental health so much worse and my anxiety has worsened so much because of it
even the one i consider to be close is always busy and i do not want to talk to about my situation
it is christmas which means gathering as a family and that makes things so much worse and that snowballs and makes me feel worse
if i could somehow maintain focus for more than 5 seconds it would probably go faster all that realizingmerry christmas although i have not been celebrating it neither considering it as a holiday since i was 12
it is been just over three weeks since we officially broke up but five rocky years of falling second to his addictive personality
after two minutes of pleasantries the conversation stalled and it justnever started back up again we did not start talking about a different show or a game or any other hobbies we all share i suggested we play a casual social game like cards against humanity or jackbox or something and everyone said no they did not feel like it
then i went home so that i could take the gre it is like the sat for grad school and there were not any testing centers near my apartment or her family home over thanksgiving break and she went home to her family
i really want you to think about that before we dive in to these methods and techniques and practices that i want you to try and embody
so far i have only been a drain of recourses and even my mother admits that my negativity spreads to others
i broke my hand and had to have surgery and i was out of job for five months and when i came back i had to change group to group five which was okay to me because all of our workgroups are totally equal and fine
i not at home playing video games for once i not as stressed out as always i am thinking about getting the knife
i just bought a house and it is fully paid off and i am 19 yes it was my money not my dads and i have about 2000 in my savings but i still feel so broke my new house is absolutely trashed from moving and it is so hard to deal with
back story we met each other a week after him and his ex broke up mutual decision but his ex pulled the plug
write down a list of everything that went wrong in the relationship i want you to really think about who is responsible
after not talking for 4 days and i seen he got rid of my photos stopped following my accounts and deleted me from his bio i knew it was different
she pointed out to me i have a problem with empathy this is not the first time i have heard i have this problem
this upcoming weekend will be hard because it is his 29th bday and christmas but i know that every moment i do not talk to him and every tear i she would brings me closer to being okay
so i will keep a good amount of distance unless she askswants me to stay friends with her i would not refuse then
my wife has now attempted to take her life six or seven times in the last 8 months i have spoken with the police no less than four times in relation to this
it is closure for me letting you know how much you really meant to me you walked into my life at one of my lowest points and i will forever appreciate that about you
i have spent the last 45 days really grieving the loss of our relationship and telling myself we were in love but the timing was wrong
i know it takes a lot sometimes even to do simple things like shower get dressed or even to go outside to get fresh air and sunlight when you are not in a good mental state
often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenonhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilliam_francis_melchertdinkel people like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them
i can not see through the fog hopefully somebody else canmy verbally abusive narcissistic mother started a fight with me but i got blamed for it as per usual
now i think back and i am actually not that good now although better than before but i still crave seeing me i miss seeing myself and sort of reliving the things i feel nostalgic about from those pics idk i just feel more out of touch with myself now than i did before
i can not imagine what would happen to me if anyone i knew found out and while that is not my primary concern it just scares me somewhat to think about it i am mostly just ashamedguiltydisgustedsickwhatever with myself and my actions
it is not too late for me to start improving myself so i think i am going to very soon start to from somewhere by trying to have a better mindset fill the void she left in me with something else learn from the relationship we had learn from my mistakes to be a better partner in the next one set some life goals and try to achieve them
when you see someone who is cold and emotionless i have no idea what people are thinking i just have to think it makes me hard to talk to and get along with
my boyfriend was from vancouver and i am from toronto we met when i was traveling 2 years ago then we lived together when he moved to toronto for living because of me
well he did not want to talk then but said we would on sunday we ended up breaking up in september i was willing to fight for us he was not
i have noticed this even more since the pandemicif i have a day off i can go through an entire day without speaking
if i had only just been more focused in my earlier life and sorted myself out if i had not spent so much time gaming and worked on my confidence and self esteem
i go through these periods where i do not eat or barely eat anything every day for weeks and then i will return to normal and then all of a sudden start skipping meals
it is all just very painful and feels so unfair i want her to be happy though i know that is what love is about
i am trying to break up or at least separate for a biti guess murphys law did not get the social distancing memo lol
so another day passes by you still get up assuming that you slept which i know you did not and you look yourself in the mirror
it was a long argument that consisted of me pleading for her to stay and work things out with me but it did not work out
he did turn up at my door early hours and the police were called to take him he is moved from place to place since
the void i feel keeps getting bigger every single day and the thoughts get worse and worsei felt okay yesterday but i want to end it rn
today i explained to my boss what i am going through and that i may just need to change meds etc he took it well
i do not have anyone safe to talk to so i am just wanting to put this on here i do not know if this is the right place
i have not told anybody about this in fear that they will treat me like a reject and dissociate all my life i have cried the most because of her
eventually after seeing she was on dating apps and at the advice of my friends i removed her from social media because she kept posting hurtful things about me continuously throughout our break up and i was not healing
you showed me that it was possible to give someone my whole heart and what it was like to become a part of another family
our relationship was dependable and comfortable we had each others backs like there is no way she is going anywhere maybe she was finally ready at the age of 2526
moved into a tiny apartment so my family did not have to deal with my mental illnessschizoid with adhd i am bored by absolutely everything have no passions only thing i enjoy is food
if you do have depression you should not keep it a secret you should always tell someone i still love you and still want you i can not and do not ever want to imagine you with someone else
i have already mentioned going back to my moms for a while but he does not want me to since this is my place
it hurts it just hurts like on that specific spot in the center of your body but at the same time it hurts in my whole body
i just want to know the next step to take i am in love obsessively insanely inhumanely infinitely undepictably superiorlytogod in love
but the desperation and thinking going back to jail and my depression at top i started to play with razors blades let us keep it that way
i have always struggled with my mental health and have always had counselling for it when my counselling stopped because of the pandemic i tried age regression to try and help i stopped after a few months because it did not help me and now i feel overwhelmed with guilt for trying it as a coping mechanism i feel like if anyone knew then i would be shamed and no one would love me
it took me years to understand this but now i knowsometimes you just happen to live a mediocre or isolated life with no chance of it getting better
i do not know what i am doing i feel disgusted with myself but then monday came around and he just said he was unhappy and i asked why
we had lived together for 2 years during which time she kept me emotionally offbalance financially hobbled isolated and in constant walking on eggshells mode to try to prevent a tantrum and the ensuing session of being told how awful i was and how it is all my fault and having to admit how terrible a person i am and promise to be better and change and beg her forgiveness
why how can you even have the ability to not care and be so cruel even when i am at the lowest point in my life you still find a way to kick me down even further
so i just asked him how he was doing and then said that i was just surprised he is been quiet with me the last few days
to get right to it i think there is something off with me i can not open up for lack of a better term it does not feel like i can not trust or i have a fear of being hurt or i am afraid to be vulnerable in fact it does not feel like anything
in my junior year of hs i became depressed and stopped caring about other people so those obsessions have left me
i do not have a sense of despair i do not feel a sense of loneliness i have been doing what i love professionally and i feel secure being alone with myself and make time to connect with others as needed
i want to help him but i worry it would just hurt him more if i try i can not help him or myself and i do not want to keep feeling so useless anymore
i reallyreallyreally tried to continue living in lifei have no motivation and i hate every day and i think it is about time to go
i could solve the problem of learning how to get myself out there and talk with people despite initially feeling very awkward about it due to extreme lack of experience in that area
and this creation of life meaning is not only limited to romantic relationships you can even start to form it due to having a fulfilling relationship with our career body family friends etc
i tried my best to be friends with them but the friend group is a little odd as it consists of my ex his little brother my exs best friend and the best friends girlfriend
they will hurt for awhile but i have gone to every church mosque temple ect and asked all of those gods and goddesses to protect my family and give them peace
i do not feel anything but hate i am sure he deleted it because he met some girl another sign i should just forget him move on
this is the closest film i have found that describes my experience with panic attacks i am interested in the films that you all have found that you feel best represented your experience with mental health
i will sit in front of my keyboard for hours wondering what to say i get so stressed and start picking at my skin and biting my nails because i do not want to lose my best friend
well the lift went up and i felt out of the hoyer and landed on my left knee then the day after i wake up having a hard time breathing and seeing my oxygen drop to 88
and then he threw it all away and left without a say it is just seal the deal for me i feel like trash no even lower than trash like you do not even matter to receive a single sorry like you do not even matter at all
since january she left me there and refused to pay any bills or rent because she would only seldom spend time there
an older man we do not know walked in and had these two gorgeous dogs and my friends both very extroverted asked if they could pet the dogs etc and the man agreed and actually ended up sitting with us
i also feel like as a teen i am 17 there is a huge pressure of having a sexual relationship and no one even cares if that is what they actually want
i have barely slept since i found outi never would have thought this to be true i can not handle another horrible breakup i can not get this off my mind i can not function
the answer is i do not know and i hate these questions because no one can make promises about the future just like a quantum probability function becomes more spread out over time the distant future is harder to know than the close future
hello so my friend is a 15 year old male and i am a 14 year old male i do not know if that is important or not
those are the only times that i feel as though i truly enjoy life as though there is not a worry in the world
hello everyone i am going torugh a really weird fase in my life right now but so many things seems to making sense
i wonder if tonight i am going to try to end myself i do not want to do this anymoremy girlfriend was cheating on me while we were still dating and we had a talk about it
this is why i never told anyone or had a therapist or anything like that i did not want them to look down on me even more
i was with him no matter what it did not matter what he did to me it did not matter how bad he treated me i wanted to be with him no matter what
one of my favorite song lyrics is from a song called only everyone can judge me by crywank it says this is not a brave face this is not a brave face this is a mask
i do not know how to get better i just want him by my side and i do not know how to do this
i have been thinking of why i feel so depressed most of the time she was able to help me feel more comfortable performing in bed after my ex ruined my confidence
i have been playing a lot of guitar and piano maybe i will start posting some videos of me playing singing soon
any enjoyment i used to have has been taken from me and it is just so sad because i know there is so much to enjoy in life but i can not go and get it because of my mental issue
which habits and things have scientifically proven to be effective in reducing suicidal urges and help people avoid thinking and committing about suicide
in other words they will go away completely at some point and that is when you will be able to move on fully but again that is only done through the right mindset and consistent healing focused action that i have mentioned earlier
everything has to go as i planned or i feel like everything is ruined and there is no use in continuing hence i just lock myself in my room for the whole day
this was the first time i had actually gotten even a glimpse of him in almost two years and i thought i had gotten over it but i had not
she ended up calling my fiancé 12x at work and texting him non stop of how i am such a terrible person
and idk what he meant he seemed a bit dumbfounded but said that i did not want to drive sometimes and little things like that
just now i literally took a knife from my kitchen and pointed it at my chest unfortunately i pussied out i am such a pussy i can not do anything i hate myself somehow i managed to hide my depression as my friends think i am very extroverted and my teachers think i am a cheerful teenager
please be gentle with your replies this is the most difficult decision i have ever had to make either waymy ex25broke up with me30 last summer
i broke up because i thought our relationship would be diminished and a real struggle my college is about 45 minutes from our hometown btw
things change please remember that we can cold come back and even if this day ends up being the worst of your life it just means they are going to get better now
i was thinking going to the dog park she always go to but i do not know her boyfriend lives in maryland and she lives ny so i am not worried about running into him
if i can find what household toxins kill or find some powerful drugs at home that will be the way to go
i do have one irl friend but they are more social than me and we do not hang out often they do disappearing acts off facebook as well and only contact me when they want something
also with having these hemorrhoid flare ups i am terrified of catching covid 19 and getting diarrhea which is why i want to leave my bf
we are planning to move in together once he moves to the states for work and my future feels bright but honestly right now i am sitting here sobbing
i am struggling with the loneliness and i am just spending my life in bed or playing video games without talking to people
in the meantime however we have continued talking daily going on dates and hanging out and sleeping with each other exclusively neither of us pursuing other people
i am so torn as to whether or not i should take it the conversation went fine at some point i have to drop off his christmas presents
i get attached to easily especially when it comes to being intimate with someone because i waited to long and hesitated out of fear i lost the person i wanted to be with
this was almost four months ago now and i genuinely feel like the entire time with my ex was a waste of time as i feel like he just used me and discarded me when he wanted to go screw around and party
the whole breakup was extremely traumatizing to me and it has changed a lot for the past few months i have been experiencing hallucinations of her
i cried my eyes out when i was 13 and my cousins dog died as our family lived near each other and we had gatherings a lot and my cousins were like my siblings their dog was like my dog
when he goes too far and does something stupid everyone thinks it is funny because it is does not affect them therefor leaving me feeling very alone when i tell him it is not normal behaviour
it broke my heart and i have never seen him like this i felt so shitty and embarrassed knowing he essentially picked another girl over me too
the next morning she went to get groceries and i am ashamed to say that i took her ipad her ipad had her passcode on the screen and i read her last messages to her friends
i think the whole low self esteem thing has affected my overall progress in life and my mind set to wanting to improve i have been very hopeless for some time
they are talking about going to her and god i do not want to escalate to this or any further like i said we did not have a good breakup so we do not really have way to communicate anymore
i just need help right now and i know that trying to talk to my mom or brother would not do anything
you lost yourself in another world another life that after a break up you end up feeling stuck you end up feeling hurt you end up feeling at your worst and lowest
it is important to know that this is normal noone can meditate without having thoughts i am so scared i am going to end up with serious mental health issues i am scared
their laugh made you fall in love all over again i know it is hitting you now and i could have probably done so many other things
6 2 stays in a public psych ward due to suicidalityi have read educational books forced myself to exercise and eat healthy i have done cbt training and mindful meditation
contrary to popculture myths it does not involve persuasion do not do it cheerleading you have got this or meaningless false promises trust me it gets better or invalidation let me show you how things are not as bad as you think
she already got caught trying to use me and then dump me at the end of the year so i ended it with her
i am just feeling so damn lonely i surround myself with alot of people and i have been talking with my bestfriend all night
no one answers what is the point of talking about it anymore no one can help i can not even help myself
any who you know me getting off track as usual focussing to the details we went to our first marc e
like after that last message i was just in shockthey all stand looking at me in fear hands or their mouths like i am answering a death call
and haha here is the fun part she told me that me not going to see her was the catalyst for her to realize that i did not really loved her and she lost her love for me it was that disappointment that got to her
like it is gotten to a unhealthy point where i have no one to talk with about what is going on in life
i also want to get married and have children and i do not see them ever maturing to the point of wanting that with me
well i found out the other night that not only has he been leading me on he is been lying to me about staying the night with all of his work buddies and that he is been seeing someone else
i will not be able to tell him about the bad days i will not get the future i have been building for the past 2 years
i am not useless or worthless and i have not really been depressed for a year that my girlfriend left me making me feel worthless
sadly she broke things off because she went to college and i joined the navy and keeping the relationship stable would be too hard
hi just looking for any advice on this i am looking to meet up with my ex in 68 months to catch up i was the dumper and it did end on good terms just looking to see if this would be a bad move
i am scared to talk to my few friends because if i tell them my problems i am scared they just will not care and will stop talking to me as rarely as they do
also merry christmas i hope everyone had a nice time in this horrible year break ups have there own stages just like grief does
i am excellent at foreplay i am good at oral sex i can engage the mind as well as the bodybut eventually you have to follow through and that is where my body usually fails me
stopped smoking weed and stopped engaging in the addictive porn behaviors i cut out all the women who takes to me and i stopped pursuing them
we also would still have sex sometimes i never know when i will be yelled at or what will be said i try so hard
its been a healing process i have done some things i regret a bit like being a friend with benefits it is like no matter how much effort i put into my appearance my body is mocking me
i am just so unsure how to process this ontop of what i already can not process and what constructive things i can do to try help them heal i have told them immediately as they told me that i am sorry and admitted i was psycho as a child with very little restraint
as time progressed we both changed but we still texted pretty often i felt a difference in her she became more distanced smoked weed and cigarettes got drunk often she was about 16 at this time but we stayed in contact and supported each other through our hardships our mothers were crazy so we bonded over that
we would been having a tough week last week but only minor issues as he called them a few days before the breakup
only these videos were around long before the trump virus forced the less spiteful or hateful of us to selfquarantine and wear masks in public and practice social distancing many people have referred to the bigger youtube personalities such as markiplier as like a friend or even like a best friend
i do not let her see that i know it is not what she needs at those times so i am calm and collected it seems because that is what she needs
i do not feel like i am strong enough to live people say to try talking to your friends when you feel suicidal that is at least the advice i get so i tried i tried talking to the closest friend i guess that i thought would care they are really nice to everyone and i thought that talking to them could cheer me up or something
i keep telling myself that i deserve better than you that i deserve to be loved with the same intensity as i love you
she stood walked up to me and hugged me i was moments away from hitting my teacher when she did this
getting divorced my green card application was marriage base will be withdrawn so probably facing deportation add that i have a court case now
to not know how they are doing or feeling it feels shit maybe i attracted people who did not have friends i do not know
the usual dark office is bright i look out the window the suns up and shining computer screen is bright and it is like i can see things again
sorry for the longass post and if you actually read all of this thank you and sorry for having wasted your time with my problems
another month went by and he realized money was going to be an issue he did not have much of a savings and he was barely making ends meet
what do i do i just want to be ready to fall in love for the first time with someone that actually wants to put an effort in for me
i do not know how i am going to go about it but all conclusions lead to her probably telling me to fuck off
i just can not stand the incessant pain of being alone especially today i guess i just need a really long hug someone to be with someone to keep me company to talk to and maybe hug and cuddle every so often but for now it is just a figment of my imagination a dream so distant and fantastic it is so unlikely to come true
out of the blue she called me on the phone at work and said that she had a bad dream and wanted to see if i was okay
the only thing that stops me killing myself is the knowledge that there is nobody else to look after them and i do not want to leave a horrible mess and ruin the lives of my friends and family
hopefully this will help diagnose and weed out the specific causes of my anxiety and provide a professional treatment for my case a sort of targeted approach
she was the first person i ever really loved and the first person who ever loved me we talked all day everyday texted for hours every night and she made me feel wanted but then it all stopped and she would be gone for two weeks and come back for a day and then be gone
a month ago i text my ex we hugged for well over a minute and both cried openly at the tube station as i was leaving
he is just fucking broken me and i am so tired he is just absolutely fucking perfect and it can never be his fucking fault
i thought the reason i do not remember most of my dreams was that i use drugs recreationally but i am now realizing that i probably mentally suppress them often to not deal with the difficult feelings that come with them the reason i remembered this one is because i am staying at my mothers house for the holidays a place where i am way out of my comfort zone
also this group is much smaller than the first i pretty much have 2 true friends one to game with and the other to fish with
i really want to go back to the gym without breaking down and having an anxiety attack so if anyone has advice on how to conquer this i would really appreciate it
little kids make me uncomfortable because i know i will never be able to birth a child so i just get so sad by the idea of kids
i seemed her like an example how you can come from such a difficult background both parents alcocholics and died while she was a child and grew up to be such a wonderful person
it is been about 3 months since my relationship ended i keep telling myself that i am over it but deep down i know i am not
i am sure you are thinking bunny why do not you seek help but i have i am currently in therapy which is apart of my services in foster care
the first step is to find at least a single person and ask the person out or ask the person to do something with them most probably something that person likes
this second time around hurts much more than the first i keep active and do shit but she is constantly popping into my mind what do i do now it is pretty pathetic but for the first time in my life i empathize with people who hurt themselves to get rid of emotional pain
i did not have anywhere to go but my brothers house so ever since then i am sleeping in his sons bedroom i do not want my family in my life anymore since they only think about themselfes and never cared how i felt or even understood me but i had no other option than to seek refuge by them i do not even have a fucking car where am i going to sleep
so as probably 70 of humans did they broke down and cried happened to me today after my training i did not knew why but i guess i have had stored up so much inside me and the sadness of not being able to make anyone happy or smile made me sadder than usual i have lived through hell pretty much i am 16 but i gave up many times on life and even tried to kill myself when i was 7 i got bullied till i am 12 since then i gave up very often on life but never tried to hurt myself or do anything i just wanted to see the people around me smile because of something i can be proud of
i just hugged her back and stayed like that if only i could meet her again now the closest i came to happiness was with madison
since i am going to a university in a city at the other side of the country it became impossible to see them irl and i am currently living in some sort of dorm where we only share the kitchen and bathroom
it feels like my body is giving up on life i am not looking for advice i am so far beyond the point of advice
i do not hate my ex for hurting me he is still an asshole tho lmao i have just realized that i was too good for him and i think you can too
i quite often use this app yubo where i have met a few guys most of the time when we match and i find them very attractive i cannot speak to them at all i become too socially awkward to text them back after a few messages
i am having doubts because she is wife material great looking never gave me any shit etc this is why i am having doubts i am not going to lie sometimes i would feel like she bored me a little and i think sometimes having my doubts when we were together was just me longing to be with someone else because i am so youngi am 20
i was also made to train other associates who were preparing to work that job position in the near future who already had the position and the pay bump while i was stuck at my standard wage that any associate who had just started would have
so deeply wrenched in my mind i just do not know what to do anymore the only thing i can do is scream in my head but that never helps
if i do not find a quick easy way to kill myself by the end of the week i am just going to run into traffic idgaf anymore
she is been helping me a lot recently i have been able to overcome some of the worst of it but when she talks i feel like she is trying to talk to someone else
every guy i have been with has always cheated on me during our relationship or left me for another woman or both
they called this to my attention because one of them as severe depression and anxiety they all gave me 6 months to see any improvement otherwise they are not going to even associate with me
i am tired i want to quiti recently discovered my friend has anxiety and i want to know what she goes through thanks in advance
she treats my sister differently reading over our texts from that period the warmth and love was so easy to see
sure you can grow through suffering you learn new things from it but why the hell do we have to feel it why the hell does it happen we do not deserve to feel it do we
i just wanted you to respect me and the relationship by standing up for us that is it that is literally it i love how now you are able to not text back as i am being vulnerable with you as you texted me from thanksgiving until like a week ago every day
i am ready i am ready to die i want to die i hate myself i hate everyone around me i am fucking disgusting and i do not want to live i have fucking nothing
without the distraction of children i look off towards what life will offer and i only see death any longevity trophy is accompanied by the death of my loved ones the death of my parents then my friends and siblings i can not ignore it anymore the process has started
it only going to get worse has more shopping moves online i would love to sit in a coffee shop and talk to someone
i texted my girlfriend about it for a while and she is amazing but she is not like an adult figure in my life and after she went to bed a couple hours ago i still felt garbage and so i went to text someone else and i realised there was no one
the entire damn school knew me as the creepy pedophile idiot who annoys everyone and i still carry remnants of that reputation with me today and it is so painful
i felt like i time travelled and was amazed i did not notice it was honestly terrifying because this never happens to me before
2 dying is easier than living you cannot take any materialistic possessions with you you are born and die alone i do not want to suffer and face hardship i want to skip all the hardship and just die dying is the end goal for everyone because it is the only thing that we can not control we can not cheat death
i can not ask for support from anyone because a huge part is splitting on them over non issues and internalizing all of that
i had gone onto reddit advice there to see how i could fit in or something how to get people to hear me i was completely ignored
so talk to your elders call your grandma or your crazy uncle that lives across the country talk to the old lonely lady next store help out the children in your community who are doing online school a friend does not have to be someone your own age or lives close to you a friend could be anyone who is mutually interesting and appreciates you
it is 1230 at midnight now and i spent pretty much my entire evening crying in my room and trying not to cut myself it is been over a year maybe two and i really do not want to go back
i was so used to forming opinions about me from other people and the validation from other people being my main goal to reach i wanted to be liked by everybody so i adapted and changed and transformed myself into something i hardly recognize as me anymore
i want to die i tried to die i have no onei just do not have the energy anymore to think of anything
do not know if i am right or wrong about this and i do not even care but that is how i feeli have truly forgiven her for ripping my heart out and i forgive myself for letting her
during the past month any time she was over there was lots of tension due to me just having insane anxiety about making sure she was happy and satisfied with whatever we were doing
i am not a virgin anymore but that was so long ago i do feel like one but what irritates me the most is that i do not really now if i even want a partner
man i have never ever felt like this i feel so empty inside myself as if it almost hurts i am not denial i am willing to get help but id just really want someone to listen to me
sex determines how boys treat me how girls treat me and how everyone treats mei am referred as the gay bestfriend excuse me what
i am fed up with having no real friends i can actually talk to and who genuinely care i am sick of having a wife and kids who could not care less about anything that is not going to benefit them
i bought a utility knife at the store today i do not know if i will use it but i have it now in case i ever need it
it is hard to ignore the feeling of knowing that maybe how i was raised to treat women just does not work anymore in this new generation
i logged into my social media as i would logged out just after she dumped me my thoughts are overflowing i am being stabbed again and again but i will not die
ionahttpgetionawebapp app that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use
sorry i did not mean for it to happen like this but it did this was late may online dating is not for me
i know how much it hurts and i never want anyone to hurt like that because it fucking sucks my ex knew that she hurt me
she went to the table and started drawing and a friend of her came next to me and she rested her head on my lap and i started caressing her hair
i feel like i am not really depressed becausewhile my lows have been low to the point of failing my classes and anhedoniathe fact that i can get out of bed in the morning is a feat unavailable to so many other depressed people
it is just exhausting to think about stupid stuff that has little to no meaning to me why would he no one else does
when i look out the window i sometimes forget and wonder what time you will be home or if you had a good day
we were supposed to remain friends after the breakup but we have been in no contact since then a month other than the comments he makes to what i say sometimes
i loved her and treated her like a princess i gave her my time a piece of my heart to her but
i did not imagine i would be so alone again nothing to do with web dev i had no fucking idea it would come to be such an impossible struggle to overcome my complete lack of love life of meaningful relations of friends
i am currently sad that the person i loved ended up being someone i can not trust anymore everything i am an artistic person and i loved what she brought out of me
it started off with fiery passion that quickly turned almost into one of those rdeadbedroom scenarios i hyper focused and started wonder why we never connected anymore
this happens 9999 percent of time which causes embarassment and i fantasize about suicide as a defense mechanism agianst such embarrassing moments
if it were you what would you do would it upset people more or help them get closure i just want to make sure i because the least possible damage to others in my life when i go
everything was perfect up until yesterday we literally talked about us moving in together in the next few months of course we had some rough patches but i thought we loved each other
god met me right there in that psych ward and i have a sense of peace i have never had in my entire life
she never hit them or anything but the mental health hospitals are horrible they treat them like prisoners anyway i am very worried because if something does not happen she will most definitely kill herself
honestly it is getting tiring when this shit keeps happening every week and sitting through silently with all the insults thrown at me about how i am selfishstupidhypocriticalevillazy etc
i have attempted to make new friends by finding yoga groups welding clubs baking classes and more events with single childfree women like myself but they are all annoying and i have not found anyone i get along with
my ex broke up with me after being a year together i am 16 and at first due to the circumstances especially it being done over facetime i was devastated
but i feel guilty and really do want the best for her i no longer believe in the path i am on
my mental health is far from stable and i get depressed i seen a therapist but it did not do much i enjoy being by myself but it gets lonely what to do to overcome this
it is almost been 5 months of break up how do i get over it and move on with no social life i quitted my job after break up and since then trying to take on jobs but due to overwhelming emotions i quit after a few days idk how to get back on myself
i am currently in therapy which is apart of my services in foster care i am receiving help for major depression disorder mdd and a few other things
i have tried to make every argument i could to keep her but she is very set in this and it makes me hurt so bad that there is nothing i can do
i was as understanding as i could be and said i am not ending things because of it and we will work through it
if you love the wrong one so much imagine how you will love the right oneif you ever need to vent it out i am here
well i bought a lot of paracetamol more than 36gr that it supposed to be mortal and diphenhydramine sleeping pills a lot to kill my self in theory also i bought a lot of ibuprofen in theory a lot to kill my self according to the investigation i did in this time
i am so tired of feeling this waya lot of advice is do not dwell on it do not think about it do not spend time thinking about it
5 yr anniversary we held on for a while but maybe it is best that i move on this was an experience and a lesson for a reason and i can not hold on forever
i know i am far from the only person whose life is affected the whole world is but that has only increased my anxiety
but today the whole frickin day i was just happy and hoping around this does not happen so often and it is fricking me out i feel energetic and i am smiling and laughing at all the stupid stuff which rarely happens tomorrow i have my finals and my mind it seems like just does not care and is wandering away plus i feel like i am anxious but just not anxious enough to study for my test
i was so fucking stressed when i realized that i did not want to report it since knowing that first experience of how they reacted i did not want to feel those feelings again
what part of i am writing this before my passing in the opening lines is not a suicide note i hate that my words were twisted as he was typing out what i was saying
anyways she texted me out of the blue one day telling me that i was had texted and account that was fake and that she was hurt by my actions
she fell out of love with me a year ago due to her needs not being met but never told me this and pretended nothing was wrong that she had been cheating on me with him in secret for 4 months including around the time we had our anniversary that she is in love with him and wants to start a familyserious relationship with him and that he is falling for her
i have a great family and many people are wishing me on social media but it does not really mean much most of these people wishing me are more like aquantainces not friends
we were not super close but it is definitely taken a toll on me i have started to accidently dissociate sometimes i think and i cry really easily
i did everything i could from checking in every day to getting him groceries and other little things he could be mean on the phone sometimes but i chalked that to his body not cooperating with him
at the time me and my exs sex life was getting terrible and i would look at porn at the end of the day and just jerk off rather than ask my gf and have her give me an excuse it just became easier to jack off and carry on with my day
i can not do anything but think how miserable i am that he cut me off like that that i have forgiven so much that he has done to me and he can not forgive me
that is how it feel ever since i have became a nonstatusposter on whatsapp i do not know what to do or how to distract myself from him
5 strep guide in becoming an extrovert than it is to unpack the reality of an individualist and how they can find meaning in the life they have and can gain for who they are with what they have
because of nihilistic tendencies even when i try to convinve myself that if there is no meaning to life than the only meaning is what we give it i do not care it seems
recently i have started developing these ticks where i start talking to myself i normally will start berating myself for some thought process going on in my head
i am terrified of being a sociopath sorry if that offends certain people like my sister passed away so that is one thing that could because emotional damage or whatever
i have moved on in a lot of ways but i know i still have a lot of work to do
sure things have gotten better at home and they have changed a little to be honest though i am not ready to forgive either of them my mother has apologized i am sorry but none of it would have happened if you had just behaved and has offered to lend an ear if i ever wanted to vent i did vent but she turned everything i said against me narcissistic tendencies i swear
i am on medication i go to therapy i speak 3 languages and study two careers at the same time and yet i feel i am the most stupid and useless person that has ever existed
i feel so alone and i try so hard to do the right thing i admired it it made me love him even more
i knew this day would come where i would have to stop talking to her but i did not want to think of it because it would because me so much pain
i am terribly sorry but her talking about such serious topics when we have only been dating for a month through online might i add is too much and makes me really uncomfortable
anyways i feel like shit and i am feel betrayed and a lot of resentment towards him we broke up a week ago
me and my ex broke up and its drove me to the point of sadness i could not believe it i was struggling and wanted to make things better so i would text her how much i love her and how she the best thing in my life and she would say give space and time ill come back she gave mixed signals
anyways if anyone has insight on how this information is accessed please reply thanksi am having some trouble in my current romantic situation
i hate her birthday because her grandparents want to throw her a party every year and i hate everyone watching her open gifts me opening them and she is just so out of it and has no clue what is going on
then i changed school again this time on 7th grade it looked like it could be different i was ready to make friends and i did make 2 a girl and a boy the boy was a nice guy and because of his appearancecoordination problemsbeing nerdyproblem talking i think i was excluded just for being with him at least it is what i think it can actually be a me problem
after this i just recommended that they be more careful to make sure they do not make people uncomfortable in the future and recommended they speak to their therapist to see if they have any input
it is highly customizable and you can get your whole family on the account if you like if you are having a hard time with motivation check it out hang in there and keep doing the things
so much fed up shit has happened to me in the last few months i feel like i am at my breaking point
i have told her that am not getting enough attention to her about 3 times but nothings changed she still behaves like this
i chose my career wrongly since it was based on who of my highschool schoolmates was going to study so i could go with them
i told hundreds and hundreds of people about the sister story and carried it around like a badge of honor until i realized it was something to be ashamed of
i just wish i could understand why she had such strong feelings for me and then just dropped it over something so petty
so i had an attempt 7 days ago talked about it on here where i took an overdose i took 16 sleeping pills that are basically xanax
just wondering if anyone could give me some words of advice on how to cope with this everyone keeps telling me how well i am doing but i fucking suck at understanding math and other essentials topics
she is great but it is not the same kind of relationshipnot sure what i want out of posting this just needed to share
1 make sure you have the proper mindset i had the wrong mindset going into itso last week my ex boyfriend 29m broke up with me we have been together 3 years
also one day in the end of june my dad lifts me up with a hoyer lift and to put the sling all 4 parts of the sling must be placed
my ex of almost two years silently fell out of love with me as i fell more in love with him and then he dumped me
you are not your feelings or emotions you have to separate yourself from them so write down everything that went wrong
but hoping and praying is the only thing i can do to right so who caresssssi made everyone miserable the friend finally responded after months but refuses to talk to me about what happened
i can not talk to anyone because i just ruin their happy christmas mood i feel so mentally full like i just ate a buffet of self sabotage
he is been so hot and cold and it is made me wonder if he is pretending not to care because he misses me too or if he really just does not care about me anymore
her whole life revolved around me and she identified as being in a happy relationship i thought finally i made friends i was so happy
some of my injuries are beginning to feel better so i am cycling again and will hopefully be running again soon
i am 21f killing myself this week end and need advice on what works best i previously made an attempt by overdosing and was sent to the hospital but it was not a lethal dose
i know this girl whom i met a few years ago at a friends birthday party she is beautiful tall long hair very pretty my ex was out with her yesterday i have my ex blocked everywhere but i follow that girl and seeing my ex out with her broke my heart
and the day after that she broke up with me my wish was to travel around the world spend all my money and die
i do not understand it i can not understand truly wanting to die i wish i could so i would at least know what to say to you i know how painful living is i do but there is so much beauty in living so many beautiful things to see so many songs to listen to so many books to read people to laugh with people to love memories to be made
i need to let you go so that i can live my life for me i do not want to let you go
i love him so much honestly i just overall feel exhausted like it is always one thing after another with no end
she messaged me a few times ok instagram i never replied i blocked her one fine day on instaa few days back i unblocked her on my insta as i was deleting my old account
i just want to dissapear just be let go because i have been suffering and it has fully killed me inside
having someone to take care of you and always support you no matter what i feel like he does not take my mental health seriously either i know he is manipulating me
but i am free now he can not come to my room to call me piece of sit i do not want to go there never again
but if he does not feel the same way what is the point i spent my time in the hospital painting journaling and envisioning ways i would kill myself
she is really great person we share many interests hobbies sexual kinks we studied together she is beautiful and she put up with me for longer that was fair to expect which hurts as much as the brakeup itself
she says she wants to get drunk and hangout with friends and not worry about cheating but needs to know someone will be there for her if things take a turn for the worst
i do not even know what i am asking just feel horrible that the man i loved more than anything may be in fact dead inside now
in case you are wondering how i am doing since you can not reach out i am doing ok thank you for respecting my wishes and giving me room to grow and move on
went out with people from her work she graduated from school in dec 2019 and got a steady job that january for the first time in a few years and she never called me or anything
but come to realise now that those best mistakes were just sacrifices i made for someone so selfish that she would not even think to do the same for me
and i have no idea what to do about it3 i can not follow simple rudimentary instructions which a nine year old child would easily follow
at this point you can really see a person for who they really are the human condition is all we are made of
but when this happened things would be brighter lights are pretty people are pretty they have shiny eyes and sparkly skin and teeth
so yeah i do not watch tv or films because of this but does everyone else get the samemy sister asked me not to kill myself around christmas but i am really struggling and idk what to do
i turned 31 years old in october after several start and stops for various reasons i finally received my degree in creative writing in 2018
i have this constant feeling of worthlessness that probably there was something wrong with me i soon started to self harm and smoke
like they make me want to fucking murder them and kill myself all the time just because they annoy me and idk if that is on me like i am so confused and even my sister was talking to me and she was like she does not think i love any of them them as in my family members which is true because i do not
but i do not want to lose old archived posts and conversations i do not really know what more to doso i have decided to document my healing to reflect and get things off my chest
she talks to me about her mum ruining holidays getting really mad and holding grudges over minuscule shit giving people the silent treatment or holing up in her room when she gets upset screaming at her family namecalling generally being selfish scaring her family by making them think she is going to kill herself
she did say she wants to be friends and i do too but i can not bring myself to reach out to her and i had to mute her on snapchat and instagram
my third relationship was almost perfect to me but there is too much damage for me to ever trust her not to do it again
he did not think i was his forever he said i do not think i have found my person yet in my head i am not attractive and this girl is just gorgeous one of those people who radiates charm
he told me he did not want to pursue a relationship with me since his trust was washed away by my actions that he felt like a fool to his family and friends for have travelled 11 hours to meet me only to find a lie but that he did not want to lose me for good and wanted us to remain friends
it is not that i cannot explain it at all or it is incomprehensible obviously they did not mean as much to as they did to me
at which point she flat out said no now the dog had peed on the blanket and it needed to get washed
i think i am being dramatic but i can not stop it it always feels like i am not being heard or i am being disregarded when we talk
i will admit i found it uber corny whenever people would just say it gets better with time not if you do not do the internal work to be a stronger personit does not
i do not know a thing that makes me feel genuinely good i could not laugh even if i tried sicidal ideas but no plans or actual desire to
i also missed the competitive exam quota by a couple of marks i relapsed i explained my feelings and she tried her best to
but we have not seen eachother in person for years her grandmother mother is an old fashioned southern matriarch that thinks boys lead to eternal damnation
but i will die and i do not have to doubt about that or hope for whatever may or may not randomly happen
i see that i need this hormone of dopamine and serotine i am addicted to kissing and hugging her and i feel enslaved and chained
it is very sad and i hope i could change it but i do not know how to do it my so 24m has been struggling with anxiety and depression for most of his life
i was desparate to make this work i normally will start berating myself for some thought process going on in my head
2013 hits start seeing a girl that one of my friends talked to it did not go anywhere and he gave me his blessing
i recently started with therapy but i realised no one actually cares about me even after with difficulty i opened up to few people about my mental health
i just hurt the people who love me but love the people that keep hurting me i learnt the meaning of kindness from her she wasis i do not know what to use
obviously that did not work i was not reacting to my surrounding but i ended up throwing everywhere doing all of this drinking and going out really broke me
for the most part i am independent because i never got much attention my middle brother jack had most of it
its kind of short story are you interested its may help you futhermy life is like a fly dropping in turbulence
i feel broken because everyone around me is normal and looks bummed about things but i can not feel sad like i should be i should also be sad about all these people that died from covid but i can not i am more convinced than ever that this is just a simulation and not real at all and i am just glitched or something what is wrong with me
so after that i was anger up to crying and i stuuffed with apvp and after night staying and smoking it near big mirror
he just kept treating me cold and packed his stuff in front of my child and would not come in the house to talk to me
my father left behind a 1year old son and left me kind of in charge of the whole situation or rather ex gf sorry english is not my first language but here is my story
fyi saturnalia is the roman pagan celebration of the god of harvest saturn later adapted by the catholics during the crusades to make it easier to convert people
am also like the neverending story too quite a lot the book and the movie and i did not realized it until someone told me that that is something i should not be ashamed of so i started watching it again and reading it and it is a part of me that i did not recognize and now every time i listen to the music or admire some art of it i feel good
and to all of a sudden cut me off hurts and honestly i am in no position to move on from her
i was put back into my unit this time with a wheel chair all the other patients knew me as i stayed in the unit longer than anyone else
i am not even able to enjoy doing things that normal teenagers do and i have forced myself to grow up and it makes you want to just end it
right now i have some wonderful friends and founded my own family too i can say having friends around me affected many aspects of my life such as health etc i even got more productive on my work and made even more progress
i do not know how to express how lonely i feel even in family gatherings i feel isolated and its not that i am physically isolating myself either i try to mingle and all but its extremely painful i have so many things to say but i have not in so long
i have no idea what i am supposed to do because i do not love him and i do not forgive him but i literally have trust issues now
1 3 days after the bu we called and i asked if we wanted to reconsider she said no told me she loved me and then again asked for nc to heal and process
she went to her parents for christmas and my dog is with my parents wich i can not visit at the moment due to covid
i miss him so much and i am hurting thoughts that he is probably flirting with and sexting others break me from the inside
and is it true that guys get over breakups faster than girls why i kind of come from a family where men do not cry and that sort of stuff
i just wanted to rant somewhere as none of my friends are up and tbh they are probably sick of hearing about this hahaha
thus i think the best path right now is to just end things as early as possible before they get too serious
but i would be lying if i said there were not those little moments every day where i think of her and miss her
once i was in i was immediately at awe how beautiful it was to be outside i can not believe i am at the beach
this whole year has been a dumpster fire for all of us and personally this christmas has been the final nail in the coffin pun intended i guess
the thought brings me joy but it also is strange because i would never think i am capable of thoughts such as this
3 i am arrogant to people i do not show it but this defines my behaviour i try to avoid a lot of people or do not think about them as my possible friends because they are not too good and it is not that i chose it i do not want to be arrogant but it is kind of not the thing you can turn on and off
it is getting tougher and tougher turning 19 today made me realize that my life is continuing without me i am losing it everything i do reminds me of her and i cry myself to sleep most nights
i wish i could tell him all this and we can start all over but the hardest part is knowing he will never want that
starting from wealth friends popularity and much more i battled depression for 5 years and found myself getting better
plus i feel that the pandemic made things a lot of easier for me because as the world slowed down i felt that i was able to keep up more in my own pace
i know there are side effects that are quite similar so not sure exactly how to different side effects from anything else
educated exvagrants of broken homes we conquer our challenges like they were made for us to step over you are better than the dream i had
to my surprise i somehow managed to get a job offer with my sobbing face thanks zoom definitely would not work offline
after that night i cut myself countless times deeper with more blood than i ever saw i did not believe in anything anymore
keep it as pg13 as possible remember all submissions will be for the general public and no names will be revealed as this docuseries pivotal structure is to provide raw and true stories
i open up about my suicidal thoughts and self harm to my friend too much i missed the baby who called me daddy
gaining weight has been a thing i have always wanted to do because being underweight severely affects my confidence and in turn makes my anxiety and depression levels higher i always talk to him about what is on my mind so he knows that
and sure i get that but it is the trauma from the initial event that comes back and terrifies me to my core
there was a lot of times like that where he made me feel undeserving or unworthy and afraid i annoyed him with my love and support for him
he could be mean on the phone sometimes but i chalked that to his body not cooperating with him during this time i kept trying to financially help him however i could
this is our second break up i still feel shattered and its currently 244 am while i am writing this and i could not seem to sleep i would love to receive messages of support from everyone really thanks in advance
idk what the fuck i am doing posting on reddit i pay for a therapist and to call her whenever i am just tired of her trying to convince me i should go to an inpatient facility
however in an attempt to express myself and in part as a coping mechanism i feel obliged to say this and more necessarily to the younger people out there
today my mom and i were cooking and i walked into the pantry likei do not know your pasta is done though mom
you gave them your all and trusted them because you felt something inside your soul that feels completely free happy and secure when you are with them
my gf found out about it months later and said i cheated on her i owned up that what i did was scummy but i never spoke to any other girls or met up with girls physically it was literally just that one night i looked at another girls pics and jerked off if i could do it over i would have never done that
i can not help but wonder if this was supposed to be a break and not an actual breakup a similar situation happened this summer and we stayed broken up for two days she ended up coming over and having a heart to heart with me saying she got in her own head and made a huge mistake
to hang out with them you essentially need to plan it months in advance and when you finally do hang out its only for an hour or so
long story short last week got into a fight with my wife verbally and because i grabbed her physical we both been dealing it with same mental health issues 2 very depressed humans without the proper help was a very toxic relationship for both of us
i started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark like going to the toilet with lights off so that they can not see me
but let it out too yourself do not be those people that just focus on the anger and on hatred and always carry resentment i dislike my ex but i am mature enough to not let it interfere with my lifebe the bigger person and just do not let it change you you would be surprised how easy it is to just walk away
those scare me the most because it happens at random most frightening of all however are my thoughts i have been heavily paranoid recently
the obvious point in face of this is comparison comes from oneself which is a fine and dandy remark by the less observant
ever since the quarantine started whenever i screwed up or got someone mad i always felt regretful but my mind told me that i am not allowed to be sad because it was my fault it was like my own mind was restricting me from my emotions is this normal or should i stop
i have talked to friends and i feel ok for a moment then i feel down once again out of the blue
sometimes these rushes get so intense that i start to cry or at least tear up especially when i am watching trailers about video games or movies or other topics that i am really passionate about
lost i am utterly shocked and feel bizzare to have missed this my memory is very very goodwhat do i do next for myself and them
i am very determined that i will become an impactful music producerartist in the future towards me and every time really he acts like the victim
it is a very tricky hard job that requires great insight skillful care and precision to perform well it requires a ton of proper preparation and characteristics that are often missing
today was christmas and dinner ended with my mother yelling and screaming at me that i had ruined christmas for her and the rest of the family
you better put a smile on your face right now or elsethis is their thoughtsi avoid people for this reason they do not own me
i post to reddit a fair bit which i put down to me wanting validation for my thoughts and stuff eg people agreeing and reassuring me since i do not really get any irl
i do not even hate you i just do not love you any more i am just indifferent and i hope i stay as happy as i am
she has taught me so much and has changed my life for the better she saved my older kids and i from a situation that was ruining me and harming my kids
it just did not seem fair to either of us i can never love myself i am 23 and have been trying to cope since 14
i am 31 yo not quite that young but no age should be a reason enough to settle for a cheater and beg for him back
i currently am not seeing any health professionals other than my doctors who prescribe my medication so i have not been visiting any therapists or counsellors and i do not really have anyone to give me some input on my thoughts
i left my abusive wife in october after 7 years together because she will not stop fucking my exbestfriend and rubbing their relationship in my face while denying any kind of affection
i had thought of how i would give it all up and even expected suicidal thoughts to vanish two days before he leaves back to his country he told me that he does not love me
i am just at a loss i have tried so much to hope for a future but whenever i try to create one for myself i draw a blank and do not even care if i have one
i would usually be fine because we spend a large amount of time together however during the times when he goes out with his friends i would feel extremely down and sometimes get really upset over it it has led to disputes in our relationship before
between the multitude of therapists i have gone through and all the cocktails of pills i have tried i am at a point where i no longer care about myself anymore
the last couple of days have been relaxing and overwhelming at the same time for me emotionally i got dumped a couple of days ago by someone who i thought loved me but did not anymore
the week we broke up we got into an argument about the dog because he was being mean to him and he promised me he would be better and that he would get his frustration under control
ps i thought this is related to my mental condition right now so i posted here but also she noted that it is normal for everyone to dissociate
i think many people will have success find love find relationships engage in dating and none of it will matter for me
i are having mental brake down and i just feel lost and the anxietyhe proposed out of the blue this day last year
my boyfriend did not reply to the invitation but he did ask me if i would be okay with him going
nietzsche wrote when one does away with oneself one does the most estimable thing possible one thereby almost deserves to live
it is almost like i am slowly going back into the hole because i no longer have hopethis is probably a lot of people and maybe i just forget it sometimes
i get hyperfixations and spend far too much time doing things related to them ex if i hyperfixate on a band i will listen to them every single day for weeks like i am doing right now actually
it is a long story and i am willing to explain it so people can help me make some sense of it all
a few weeks later we got together and started a relationship we had a good time were falling in love and just were really happy
the dickhead coworker said i would not hurt you i like you oh yeah sure fucking pleasefucking please do not spread your mean ass damn disease
most of this was because i worked so hard to cut out things and people who were serving no purpose other than being constant triggers amplifying the negative beliefs i had about myself or hindering my growth and recovery
i remember crying in the bathroom at school for 3 classes i am not special i can only destroy never create
i feel numb though i do not know how to explain it no matter how hard i try to correct my old ways they still come back to haunt me
my friend 40 thinks he is a prophet he has always been into spiritual stuff but recently it has been extreme he also watches new age videos such as magenta pixie and things like that enneagram and thinks he can influence energetic vibrations to lead humanity activate stargates etc in addition he wants to be like jesus i am really worried about him as i think it might be paranoia or something like that
it hurt because this person left me did not give us a chance to work out what it was that need to be fix
i wish i was able to carry myself in the way i am in my headthe worst part is seeing other people live experiences you know you could have had
not much to say i just wanted to say hello these boundaries every time would get broken by slowly devolving back into the habits we usually had
it is gotten worse in the last week or two for no particular reason maybe i am just realizing just how lonely i really am
i hate myself so much i hate that i was not good enough for him i feel so worthless and so ugly
i selfsabotaged i tore him down i broke up with countless times for reasons i do not know the other day he had finally had enough and said we need to be apart
she took me to see someone and i was put on anti depressantsof life and i want to quit like the worhtless piece of shit i amhey guys
after months of being in quarantine and doing this one night i saw a model on instagram who posted she had an onlyfans and i foolishly subbed to it for a month which is the minimum you can do jacked off to it one time and never looked at the app again
i have no supports aside from my therapist my mom is not much of an option regarding mental health stuff and i am not close with either side of my family for a smorgasbord of reasons
i wanted to wait abs be engaged fir a year or two but he wanted to get married as soon as possible long story but things with him the kids and the ex wife just got worse
something she insisted she did not want me doing while we were together but figured may as well chase it now while i do not have stuff like a relationship to worry about
i now have petechial hemorrhage all over my face and some on my neck my throat perpetually feels like it has a lump in it
he was not ready for anything serious should i hope that he will come back when hes ready sometime in the future or just accept hes gone forever
to be fair though i have been neglecting myself for the past 3 years i have been eating pretty poorly and have not worked out in over 3 years i have really let myself go
it was a mutual break up due to long distance and overall not seeing a future together we dated a little less than a year and we never got to the i love you stage
but this is the first time in my whole life that i have ever lived alone and for financial reasons still in the home we shared as a family
i have also never felt a huge joy of happiness even on my birthdays i am kind of excited on my birthday but not as much as i was before
tbh i have been a terrible kid when i was young i am not really friends with anyone at university and my boyfriend is the only close person there
he was my world and the one i saw as my other half and who i thought would be my person forever
short attention span for anything that i am not extremely interested inexpressing my opinions and not even realizing that i am offending peoplepissing them off
but honestly this made me snap back to reality away from my fantasy and i am whole heartedly committed to working on a better us
it is not worth the heartache that it brings when they find someone new or they are busy moving on with their life
my parents are not having this when i mentioned it they are denying it because it is honestly my best bet for a future job
i managed to play cod warzone with 2 of my friends later today but i still feel so empty it is a flurry of emotions and pain
i have been speaking to one of the guys harry for over 8 months we often sext and talk about our future together i have shared a lot with him and we get along so well we might as well be the same person more or less i just wish we could be best friends instead but i know that could never happen now
but anyway i told my family mom and dad that i might need help around christmas they agreed my depression or whatever it was got a lot better during this time eventueally i saw a sleep doctor something although i will admit i quit pretty quickly i got enrolled in some kind of boarding school in summer 2019 and thought that was the end of all this
i was fond of studying nevertheless so despite of having nothing at all i learned a lot and read a lot of books
no nothingthis first happened in october i wanted to try this reality shifting thing that had been happening on tiktok
but hoping is doing nothing but breaking you down and it is time to take your own advice and trust me i wish i could do it different
in the amidst of all that my grandmother one who helped raise meand also swept the abuse under the rug died
or help me to my one true movie moment and show up at my doormat but only of you bring a garlic clove with you
hi there i am not too sure as to where i can actually post this sorry if this is irrelevantso this is not really about me more about a friend of mines
all i want is to stop loving my parents so i can fucking be an individual and choose who and what i love
i miss having someone to hold while we watch tv or cuddle with when we are laying in bed getting ready to fall asleep
it feels good telling i guess whoever reads this thread because i feel whoever is reading this already cares more for me than my friends
i do love him i do miss him that does not mean i am going to say it when i am not comfortable with him at that level yet
as the title explains i was looking at my exs story and she posted her graduation celebration and i was holding my phone a weird way and accident touch the plus button and power on my iphone
every day is a challenge i want to collapse just feel weak just feel vulnerable but in the arms of someone a man who understands a man perhaps in the military like he was too with a similar set of experiences because most civilians cannot understand
it is rare enough where if i say it my identity and hers would be revealed but she is missing some genes and it results in her being unable to form speech some mental inhibition and other behavioural difficulties like hitting throwing things pinching pulling hair etc
after an hour he mentioned the phrase aromantic spectrum and my brain started darting back and forth through ideas and rationale and oh holy crap does this
i have been very sad for all 28 years of my life being alive feels so difficult nothing i do is right anymore just feel down an a failure to my son
paid everything off i have 122 left i am going to get an escort lose my vcard and end my pathetic life after christmas then i will be at peace
her friend that was there even said even she would not be okay with that and both of them should know better considering my past
she started to lose feelings for me all of a sudden the point where it became straight up ignoring me for days at a time
can anyone help me recover from this it is not like i am doing bad professionallypersonally it is just that i can not function properly without having everything written down
from our trip to mexico to together looking out the bathroom window to the sky the way she hangs the pictures and her ukulele next to it
i should have just run away as fast and as far as i could get the truth was and still is
my plan now is to end my life i can not see a future ahead because i am kind of useless and i see no joy in life everything is just a hustle to pay my overdue bills
hi i am in a long term relationship and have kids with himeverything was going well until i lost my job due to this pandemic corvid 19so i tried to reach out to him buy telling him how this whole thing is affecting meinstead he just kept quiet and faced the other way and fell asleephe did not even try to give me hope or ideas i have lost everything including a shelter i am changing visitation in different houses with my kids and i do not even know what to do
i somehow made somebody from my main courses to have lunch with me and even sometimes go to the gym with me as his friends are all in different studies
and you had a lot of firsts in our relationship and so did i i did everything i could to experience life with you
i am not from an impoverished family i never struggled with school go to a decently high ranked university ended my first semester with near perfect grades but not perfect which my brain interprets as failure was never bullied as a child which honestly amazes me looking back as i feel like i was the stereotypical kid that would have been bullied and just had many other privileges growing up
i mentioned friends but i do not really think that they are those who really are friends more like dudes that i can spend time with because i can not tell them shit about because i will not get any support and just something closer to critics
i feel being lonely is the one state of being people do not ask you about possibly because if you tell them you are lonely and they hear it they would feel an obligation to spend time with you so i can say it here i am so lonely i am starting to wonder what the hell is the point
that is why i am writing this when i am down but not spiralling and it is that feeling that i miss being so in love
loneliness is a deep feeling within myself that i just do not belong and there is such a shame attached to it too which makes it feel worse
on some days i feel like wanting to end all of this somehow i just came out of a bad depression where i spent entire days in bed and even had suicidal thoughts i am feeling a little better now
immediately i said no i asked them if i could invite my boyfriend and they said no but i invited him anyways
she tells me she loves me but than cries over an ex for an hourmy life is so incredibly empty and i feel worthless
he is an engineerdeveloper always trying to find the best by holding on to a current stepping stone it is an endless search for the ideal
i have not been out of some sort of relationship for the past 7 years of my life which probably makes me sound like i fall in love with anyone
all i do is constantly open all my socials to look at peoples stories and posts its the only thing that makes me feel like i am not alone right now
the guy this vent is about told me weeks before he lost feelings that he did not want to date until we met
i know it is not the right solution drungs does not help me but you know what fuck it idc anymorei left my hometown for about four years
i almost have these passive suicide thoughts everyday that is becoming more active by actively planning my eventual suicide i wish things were different i wish it was better
i really regret what i have done but i respect her for leaving me it is been about a month since that last message and i want to send her a closure letter that says best of luck in life
have i seen exes genuinely come back saying they want to get back together genuinely no i guess i am curious where this way of thinking comes from though as it seems to promote a lie to dumpees that their exes will come back
tldr girl that was my ride or die left me after 2 years 6 months of separation i feel used betrayed angry and heartbroken got to let her go because she is dealing with some personal stuff and i am apparently only a distraction love her more than life itself still i can not accept being just friends with her
i sent her a hand written letter and a tiffanys compass in mid october for now i have myself and i am ok with that
over the past few years but especially this year my friendships have started to feel more and more like a chore
posting on a throwaway because familyfriends know my main so i am 21 been pretty stressed with school and feel so behind
i do not know what i did after that but i know that i just went to do something else what pains me is that if something else happened i might have allowed it
sometimes i fall asleep and for whatever reason i get really sad because i want there to be someone next to me
i have noticed this is a trend that i have had in all of my relationships i have had 3 they have all been 2 years and i have ended it with them every time due to me being extremely codependent
i often find myself fantasizing about doing things that i believe would end my torment even if they are morally despicable and believing i would not feel remorse afterwards
but i can break the ice for awhile and fake it on the surface but i do not belong on the surface
i wanted vanilla and she told me she wanted a little bit preferred chocolate i happily agreed to the change and she kept telling me not to worry about it
i had an attempt a while ago it made me feel like garbage it is as if we matured as a couple he visited my country again met my family everything was great
i think we had maybe two actual months of being engaged before that incident then 5 months of limbo until we ended
this is also my first serious relationship that i have been in anyway we ended things but i can not stop thinking about him and feel like i will never move on
i know i am usually down to earth and chill solid guy like wtflittle reminders on here everyday open to topic suggestions as well
then a few days later after ignoring my messages in the meantime he broke it off completely via text he said he did not think it was a good idea anymore and that he did not want the commitment
sometimes i will think something mea about someone who is just having a good time usually about their selfpresentation and when i realize what i thought i feel sick
she blamed me for everything and made some very strong accusations that really broke me but kept telling me there was a chance things could be fixed
it probably lasted a minute or two are these the symptoms of a panic attack specifically the coughing or something else
she lived about an hour and a half away so it was never the easiest relationship but we always made it work
anytime i get mad or i get in an argument i raise my voice it is not even intentional it just always happens
i quickly blocked her so she will not see that i looked at her story luckily but still i thought i was getting over this girl but just seeing her face fucking killed me
somewhere btw i heard he wanted to over it all every time i move on you tell me how you still want to get together and i believe you
maybe it is just childish of me maybe that is the case i mean i never felt like this before so why now
now on instagram he took her last name and started following the same accounts that we used to and it hurts so fucking bad to imagine someone else holding her doing things that we once did making promises to each other the same promises that we had made
i have been feeling so grateful for the great relationship i had but also for him taking the courage to break up something that was not being the best for us both
although i have never let this effect my practice and allways ensure i am fit to work and try to make an extra effort when looking affter people who i feel are oftern dissismised and treated negatively in our healthcare system for instance people with mental health or addiction problems as from both sides i have seen people treated negatively because of this
just constantly trying to belittle me even outsiders have said how cruel they are so i know i am not imagining it
fourth one was extremely codependent and did try to kill herself when i left the effects that it has on your body mind spirit are very real
i swear i can not take this anymorei do not need replies like there are a lot of girls in response to me saying i needed that he said god what is with chicks nowadays and needing reassurance
i found her account and see that she constantly is posting about how hot these members are and how she would suck the soul out of them or some other sexual act
constant questions from family and others about how there is no way i can not find a girlfriend with the money i make at my age but they do not understand the never ending harassment i feel from them
i find it difficult to get out of bed and i mostly spend my day in my room on my laptop or inside the house
i was not a popular student inside of school and frequently switched schools i eventually made it to a private school
even my most deared friends now have kids and projects of their own it feels like every became just a person who i worked with you know even in relationships i am basically numb to whatever feeling might grow for another person
i have people around me who i know are there for me and might possibly see this reddit post but i do not want to dump all of my problems onto them because that is not fair i am always greatful for the support i recieve from the people closest to me especially from my boyfriend he always cheers me up
my friends were not good quality friends or i was dating men and women that did not mesh well with me or just were not kind
i am a fat depressed fuck that is not good at anything not even the games that i have spent literal thousands or hours on i am an absolute disgrace and i do not know how this happened
i loved her did everything for her she involved me in a love triangle returning to her ex then promising me to end it she failed i gave her out
even tho she has blocked me everywhere and i stay away from anything related to her still everything i do see or feel reminds me of her
i am in a way better spot then i was a year ago i am no longer dependent all i can do is sit here and feel overwhelmed and hopeless
when i was younger one time took me on a trip through tons of road and intersections to show me his house and tired 12 yr old me at 11 pm was none the wiser to notice that house was just a street away from me
people i have talked to avoid me and make up excuses why they can not talk they assume i am happy without them and that i am fine
another red flag is that i feel like i have to walk on eggshells talking with her if i am not romantic enough she will get mad at me
i am not at ease with it and i run away from relationships out of fear my heart physically hurts i am nauseous all the time
my spiritual journey started a few years back when one morning i was triggered triggered to the point of my body consuming and allowing my own angers anxieties to wreck and destroy my morning i thought to myself there has to be more as well as i do not want to feel this way anymore i want to change the way i react respond rather than just letting myself take in someone elses projected pain anger and sadness
they just casually talk about their weight and their boyfriends and girlfriends and it makes me so mad i am such a loser
i am sorry for posting this i just wish i was normalso it is been quite a while since my last post but i am not feeling any better
and i really wish we will meet again in the future when everything is better because i truly found him one of the most interesting intelligent and cutest guy ever
we all are hurting we all are in pain we all are just trying to figure ourselves out we all are feeling all the feels we all have moments of gratitude we all have moments of happiness we all have moments of presence
we had peace when you finally moved away your family no one bothering us because they did not understand usi am not scared of dying anymore i think that i am finally ready
i have cried and cried starved myself for weeks had nothing but wine as a meal tried rebound sex did not help btw and after all that i am finally starting to find clarity
why am i thinking about hurting myself with no emotional reaction i have cut in the past once or twice but it never did anything for me like what my friends did
i have had a life that has basically been nothing but trauma one thing after the next now i am full of nothing but hate and anger i never wanted to be like this i keep trying my hardest to change for the better but it never seems to stick
i do not even know why i am posting here there are too many people hurting and no one can fix it
last night i had a breakdown it was triggered by a singular burp i was shaking i could not breathe my heart was pounding and my muscles froze i am still in pain and it is been over 24 hours
i know it is hard and i do not want him to be alonei want to help my friend but i just do not know how
i failed him i failed her and i have went from having everything i ever wanted to nothing in such a short time and i am struggling really struggling not to end it
everyday i wake up crying and cry myself to sleep i have tried to call the suicide hotline but they hang up on me
hi there my name is yan i am from brazil and i have 20y then she went on with a hot and cold behavior so i went back to no contact
sometimes i feel optimistic like there is that guy who had nazi tattoos on his face then got them lasered off and removed himself from all hate groups so surely i can stop being an asshole and start being a likeable person but i feel like i have been trying for a long time now and just constantly failing
i feel like i am going mad i have blocked her on everything but i know she is now with the office guy a super rich fella i feel inadequate and insane and lame i genuinely do not know what to do maybe one day i will feel better but right now i do not know if my last year was nonsense and i am slowly unraveling lies and wondering how much of a fool i was
i have bpd depression ptsd eating disorder and i just can not take it anymorei do not know what is the right way to end this but i will do it
life moves quickly around here and meaningful connections are hard to come by but i am nothing more than that
i used to have someone i would call or text when i started feeling like this but i know i am just a burden to him now
my ex has moved on he looks like he is courting someone now and it looks like it is going well for them but i am here feeling like a disposable
i am already doing all i possibly can to stay alive and to change but it barely slows the decay one of these days i will truly just stop
what is the point of trying to find love again if they will just poison everything i know with their memory and then leave me to deal with it i have nothing left
now i am not clingy or need someone around with me because since we are kind of older and i am atleast 23 i know people can not be around all the time
i need some advice and i need to know how to help my dad i can not lose him tooi keep thinking about how soon i will be old and then dead about climate change
and i just it seems to have triggered an anxiety i was not quite able to shake offmy apologies if it is vague i do not quite have the mental energy to go into detail right now
it just makes me think way too much and overanalyze the situation psychologically oh man i hope he does not see me in that light i feel like i sounded like a dick why the hell did i say that etc
this is my first time ever posting anything i have felt that even if i do write about myself or my life story no one will give a shit
we planned this discussion for days and i was so heartbroken and anxious i just have to move on life is all about living and you can not live when your sad
i just wanted to share it somewhere because you know nothing really changed during pandemic for me and i have about 0 social contacts with peers idk it kind of hits hard that being alone is also detrimental for mental health but it is interesting at the same time
each and every night i try to sleep i feel my heart cave within itselfjust before sleep attempts to take my soul away from this misery and into the land of fantasy
my sister asked me not to kill myself around christmas but i am really struggling and idk what to do i feel like i let everyone down and i am a burden
i am absolutely heartbroken on a number of levels because i valued his friendship above anything else i have no one else to turn to
she told me things would only be worse for her if i left i did not buy it and did not speak after that
i have pretty much planned what i will do when the times comes for the least dramatic time consuming and least painful end
when you call the suicide hotline bc canada and get through rather quickly and tell them that you a severely depressed this has been the hardest christmas ever aaaand every sharp corner just looks like an answer
i have had depression for 9 years now in that time i have attempted suicide by overdoses cutting crashing my car and investing poisonous seeds
so after discussing it we both reasonbly come to such a conclusion my dad rushes in demanding to know what i am doing
hi this is probably going to be long because i just want to vent and i do not know seek out some comfort maybe somebody has experience with this because i am at my limit right now
i have supportive friends but i feel like i can not tell them this because if i decide not to die i will be wasting their time and if i decide to die they will stop me
this simple understanding was enough for me to set up on the path to seek and understand the art of permanent happiness
when i started high school i had gained weight due to puberty stress and recently birth control and antidepressants i only feel attractive when i receive attention or validation from random men
and to stop thinking about her someday i might miss you but i sure do not miss you right now any advice received would be helpful
i looked into his pattern and it was essentially taking things like her shopping at a store near his which is on the busiest street in my city or her saying hi to him when they were at a wedding as signs of her infidelity
i do not know what this is and i can not find any articles about it and i was wondering if anyone here has any idea
we have a child he is my world like the memories i do have were not even mine or were from a past life
that guy who is ina great relationship tons of friends who look out for him tells me bro you should learn tk be happy alone not that this is wrong but after a point of being alone a person like me who is not an introvert starts losing his sanity
hope people understand what i am trying to say i am so fucking envious he can play games with so many people and has so many good connections
but on that they the clinic refused to keep them because they were not jet a harm to themselves and others but they should come in two days later to check
we danced to music and kissed for the first time to do really well in college to be a good big brother to my younger siblings
so a quick note of what i have learned did any of you had these kinds of profound and fucked up realisations
she does not know how tempted i am too blackout drink she loves me a lot but just knowing i hurt someoneso genuine kills me
i really want to die i even attempted in september do not think anyone can fix this problem i just want things to change and its out of my power
i am not sure why anymore there is very little left of me lmaoit all starts with anxiety then i can not control myself and end up watching porn
i want to give a girl a hickey i am sick of seeing couples hugging and kissing i am missing out i am such a pathetic loser i deserve to die i just want to cuddle a girl you know i crave hugs cuddles and kisses i used to hug my pillow and blankets but the effectcwore off now i am suicidal
i do not recognise my voice any touch feels weird kind of unpleasant even and i ate too much for my eating disorder my brain is telling me to jump
strangling myself made my being alive feel so much more immediate which was nauseating compared to the dissociative sad stasis preceding my decision to die
so i become irritable and defensive towards every little comment or constructive criticism someone gives me then i come home and i am all alone
i was tired of being the because of every that went wrong in his life i want tired of being just an spectator of his life
it does not hurt as much as a failed engagement of course but it hurts so much not understanding what wnet wrong
anyway this post is probably very confusing because i wrote this stupidly this is not me saying i am going to kill myself right now so it is not an urgent situation i left out alot of parts of what makes me want to kill myself because i am not sure how to explain them this post is kind of just a rant i guess
maybe it was because i was afraid the rumor had spread but it was no secret i liked sex as much as any other teenaged boy and my ego at the time which is what i have named the personality i adapted while i was really killing it would not have cared he would have brushed it off and asked the next girl
i said i am not mad that you have someone else or of you do not want to talk me or if you do not want to keep a good friendship i am mad because you saw me trying harder to show you i care about you last week and you just did not have the courage to come and tell me please do not try anything else everything is done she still used my acounts a couple of days before and i felt like she was there just to take advantage of me because
she decides to vent to ot guy about it on facebook even my family its almost like i am in the twilight zone due to a curse
now i am 10 months behind on my mortgage 2 months on my electricity my mortgage is forbeared until march but i do not have the money at all
but it is almost like this pain is proof that what we had was so real and amazing and it reminds me that it was all my fault
now i am testing an idea out to see if it helps people find others near them to hangout and do group activities regularly in person after this covid thing ofcourse because i have noticed myself being happy when i do just that
i had to fly across the country to see him before he passed and while i was with him a friend was watching my dog and she my dog broke her leg subsequently needing surgery to repair a growth plate
i do not know what to do anymore i have felt suicidal and even homicidal alot of this timebut not even my best friend wants to answer my texts
i have 1 friend and that is it i had a spouse but they told me i was too much to handle mentally so they left me
i felt like after a while i did not need to go to the psychiatrist anymore that just by telling people what i was really feeling i had cured myself
always talking as though their words are coming straight from god most ironic thing is that he does not believe in god
she told me not to worry and said she would not stop talking to him because it would be awkward since they have a class together
my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me yesterday this is the first time i ever experience something like this as in only 20
i would give you guys the biggest hug if i could my dm is always open if you want someone to talk with no matter what gender or age you are i want to be here for you to the best of my ability 3
i understand that this is how a pd works though right that i can recognize the fake thoughts but the fact that they are there might indicate the existance of a disorder i am definitely not hoping for it to be case but it would certainly explain a lot what are your thoughts
a little bit background about myself i am ryan and i am 22 years old i grew up in a broken family and i struggle with childhood trauma
i have a hemorrhoid that does not seem to be getting better that came from my eating disorder and overdrinking of coffee
we got locked down and she refused to see me she was playing animal crossing with this guy and i was blowing up her phone
i have talked to a therapist but what they are saying never helps me they say all the time to speak with my parents which is only going to make things worse
hey everyone breathwork meditation has been having an awesome impact on my life recently so i just wanted to share some info about it for anyone thinking about getting into breathwork
i deleted all my social media so i did not feel the need to see what she was up to which i think was a good idea for me to heal
and today it is clear that she is taking the time apart more seriously than i anticipated just about 20 minutes ago i saw she changed her facebook to single i am so torn i am lost i am hurt
i am taking more hits than i could manage to avoid i am tired of not allowing myself to enjoy the moment and always finding something to pick about it
i find it odd that there is not a right to die program to assist people that just do not want to live anymore peacefully
i never meant to hurt her like this i said what i said out of love and i honestly wanted her to feel better
the last thing i would want is for him to blame himself for any part of it it was something that was always bound to happen and this was completely my decision
my brother who is 35 has been living with my parents the last couple of years he was out on his own but soon moved back in with them
i have tried going to a couple of therapists and i am 100 sure that those dumb asses were causing more harm than good to most of the people who sought their help
the related condition also subtype of factitious disorder it is called munchausens by proxy in the dsmv it is termed factitious disorder imposed on another
he then messaged me last friday and said he is really sorry for pushing me away he is been in a bad place and he knows he should not have but he just could not deal with talking
as i explain it to others imagine being drunk and high but without the falling overetc just the way your mind feels
does anyone else have those they get so bad sometimes it makes me feel so bad for the things i think
for the last 2 years i have gone through phases of restricting food and eating normally for maybe 3 weeks i restrict obsessively by counting calories and one or no meals a day and avoiding certain foods i am constantly on it and find it difficult to stop lots of critiquing in the mirror trying to pinch my ribs weighing etc
i have suffered a deep depression for two years now putting effort into even trying to love someone else seems impossible he was everything every part of my life and considered in every decision
i am facing a bunch of different issues in my life right now and i am having a hard time finding a therapist online who i think would be suitable for all of them
i generally hate my life but recently i have been trying to plan how to change it but just when i start thinking about how it will take time but be better in the end something happens and the worst part is it does not matter how small it is it still makes my brain go back to i want to die and there is no point to living especially when i am so alone and always have been and it feels like i always will be and that i am not good enough to be loved and i just generally feel like a monster
he would stroke my hair and has cuddled me when i was cold on two different occasions i started feeling depressed angry i would hit things my knuckles are scar tissue to this day
this summer i stole old pain meds from my sister and took a lot of them i think i got high
i live in a state of constant fear and despair and i can not take more of it stay the fuck away from me
but my friends are not going to be happy about it i am exhausted most of my time i just look at the ceiling in my rooms or my hands
i play piano and saxophone also guitar but i rarely play jazz on guitar just cuz i am not good enough at guitar my favorite standard is autumn leaves but i have been playing round midnight a lot lately
i am kind of excited on my birthday but not as much as i was before also i do not even have the motivation to study as well although i kind of wish to
as she looks super happy and it makes me happy but i could not get that feeling of being so worthless all day yesterday when i saw it
i told him i am not ready for another relationship because i have feelings for my ex he asked me if i was up for casual sex
she either lied to me about her feelings or she is on a reboundand both of those things make me not want to be friends with her
i am tired of resisting these thoughts that tell me to simply give up that it is all bad anyway that being alive will not make things better
i do experience these thought distortions specifially i selfloath and oppress myself in my head i also might imagine that people will try to hurt me in certain situations often in school am superstitious which apparently is also a sign of schizotypal and i think people have bad thoughts about me but
my brother had said to me in a joking manner that its messed him up regardless of his tone humor tone i take this very seriously as i typically take most things people say very seriously
i even posted my pictures online which i never did in probably 4 years i held onto the idea of us together every time i got an intrusive thought
i can not see myself getting old and it scares me because living seems to be my only option i just want to feel something else than loneliness
she usually has a severe manic episode every few years that always ends is property damage and either the cops or an institution being called
these things are not necessary for survival in the same way food and shelter are you can exist without and existence is perhaps the only thing anyone is entitled to the rest is
i am convinced that when it comes to an exam i will fail and fuck it all up anyways and is it true that guys get over breakups faster than girls why
when my loneliness flares and i cannot escape it my hart aches and all i want to do is grab my chest curl into a ball and cry like i am in a cheesy teen drama scene
recently though i hit up a girl to have a coffee and she agreed and it was a beautiful experience and she said she liked it i like this girl and i do not know how to go from here to not lose her
i had a complete breakdown over that because all i could think about is how much he wants to see his ex
i would look the same drowsy unmotivated sad hopeless empty suicidal i am tired so so very tired and ready for all of it to end
how are you guys getting through the depression stage they say the depression stage lasts the longesti really hope that is not true
that i do not want to end it and i guess that is fine because who cares if you sad right i was always there for you through thick and thin
how do i get back to normal life please i need help i never realized this i feel really embarrassed to get back to socializing with people who i acted more depressed to when i had it better than them i feel so lost regret and confusion
anyway i have been having family trouble they do not seem to understand what adhd is and they get mad at me for it etc
now think about this something that is a part of you something that provided your life meaning and gave you fulfillment is suddenly taken away from you
i sometimes feel that i met the person i am meant to spend my life with but i do not know what to do
now i am feeling like this myself without someone helping me like i did to others past relationships were toxic and of course failed
my story will be i followed my dream girl overseas for love where she discovered i was not enough and i left to go home a broken man her story will be she went overseas to follow her dream career broke up with her ballandchain ex and then spent the next few years partying and finding herself
my shirts are always long sleeve i hide my flat butt and i can be in pain at times due to my hemorrhoid flare ups
april was a magical month no sad thought at all productive month the month of a healthy lifestyle i was shocked but happy i guess that month went smoothly i was waking up early doing yoga working out hiking eating healthy journaling and nothing would seem like to end it
however his clothes were never going to make enough for rent and his other expenses so i would say that i sold them but instead it was me giving him my incomei am blessed to have a pretty stable job
but i would have liked her to just be more open and honest about it there was no need or reason to hide it from me
i keep trying and trying and i know i sound so pathetic but its my mom she is supposed to help me when people hurt me but all she will say is that it is not her problem
lost interest in doing anything with him how he felt when i distanced myself bc apart of me did not want to be with him anymore
we had almost everything in common with just enough difference to keep things interesting but now i struggle to find someone who i even have passing commonalities with
today i still think about whether i am ok or not maybe i just brushed it off because life kept coming and i had to keep going
i am not sure how this is supposed to work so sorry in advance if anything is wrong i a 26 female and my husband 29 who was born in china met in college in 2012
i suppose i have learned one thing in a societal sense i care about a persons autonomy above all else a persons ability to think and determine for themselves and how fucked up it is for other people to undermine that core human trait
he said something really upsetting recently and i just sat there and could not really get anything out until i got out and broke down crying
i have never belived that it would have this impact or get rid of other intrusive thoughts but it is lowkey mad at how much it impacted me
is anything i do actually genuine or do i only care because it could affect me like when my dad was still alive i was always worried when he and my mom were alone because he was violent and an alcoholic and i was worried for her even though it was unnecessary but why did i care did i genuinely care and was worried or did i care because of what would happen to me i like to think i actually cared but i do not know if i am lying to myself
my parents older siblings never really took any interest in any of the things i was interested in it was pretty much always either do what they want to do or do things on my own
right now i am completely heartbroken and my friends as much as i love them and i know they care are just saying it is over and accept it and right or wrong it is not what i need to hear right now i guess i just have to have the hope that it will work out because otherwise i will crumble
you have known me for much longerso my stepdad got me a tripod thing for my phone to shoot videos for school
i can not fucking take it anymore please just hand me a bottle of pills so i can finally od i am kind of at a crossroads and feel like it is a wrap for me
it all starts with anxiety then i can not control myself and end up watching porn i can not explain the shitty feeling i feel
but now since he left i had a similar problem with one of my online friends but to a lesser extent
have you ever thought about your loneliness so deeply that at some point you hit rock bottom into realizing how lonely you feel
because as fucked up as some things sound things were also fine i honestly do not know where i am trying to get at with this rant
none of my friends care anymore because this has been going on so long none of them have the capacity to keep dealing with me and i get it i am a burden on the people around me and i feel awful i try to better myself but i do not think i am doing well enough my birthday was 3 days ago and the only person who even acknowledged it was my roommate
i want to preface by saying i am aware this is gross and i wish i did not do this i always feel invisible i was and am expendable for them
in addition i am trying to read as many books as possible because i love learning however i feel intense loneliness while working and studying
she always screamed and freaked out over little things blasted music and made messes nonstop slept nude from the waist down with the door open
i dumped the piece of shit that is my now exboyfriend after a long time of going back and forth the final straw was the beginning of emotional cheating and emotional manipulation to make it look like anything other than that
i have gotten better and the last time it happened was about 5 months ago my business venture has failed i tried to start an investment group and it failed also
i have also sought help in school and other ways but nothing helps i spend days on my smartphone looking at people i think have better
this led to ptsd symptoms which i am trying to obtain treatment for but am terrified that my abuser will repeat their actions leading to my situation getting worse
turns out he tried oding and had went to the hospital i want to share this story because it makes me more depressed
asked me to spoon him or give him back scratches nightly but would not want to reciprocate would often promise later
originally i was told it can only happen from ptsd so they said i have a trauma even if i can not remember it because it is suppressed or from early childhood
i keep fighting reaching out because i do not want to hurt either one of us but i just want to know he is doing okay
how am i supposed to cope with this how am i supposed to hold on until i turn 18 which is next october
people say i am perfect and shit but when i want to get a boyfriend oh no i am not what they are looking for i end up being the little sister then they are surprised when i leave them and try to hit me in the weak spot i often got the you thought we are in an anime but guess what its real life you will never survive the people that told me that are unemployed and got no one now so i am happy karma got them
i started working at a bar which led me to partying with older kids and dealingsmoking weed i do still smoke a small amount daily anyway this is what i was doing
indeed i have done many wrongs to be frank i have caused damage not only to myself but to others i have now a history of being unreliable and i do not know how to fix it i feel like such a fraud
hmm i do not know i really wish i had someone to talk to lately it is been a while since i met and got along with someone new
just woke up every morning thinking how bad it is not to able to spend my moment with a good lady kissing hug affection and touching
shameless was one show me and lance understood on a regular mindset of what we perceived that show so fellas i now know what it feels like to never want to just go outside
why is it 5 month on and still no better still sitting here thinking about him almost every second of every day
recent research suggests that if you focus too much on trying to feel good all the time you will actually undermine your ability to feel good at allin other words no amount of feeling good will be satisfying to you since what you expect all the time is not physically possible for most people
she will be able to focus on other parts of her life that she is neglected over the past few years because of me
i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression recently and have started taking ssri medication to help and i am scared that those meds are causing this but i have also felt like this before just not as frequently as this previously it was every week or so now its almost constant today has been rough i am at home with my parents but they just are not people i can talk to
the letter basically contained how much i appreciated her how proud i was of how hard she pushes herself my honest thoughts about the possibilities we could have if we came together to build and grow and so on and so forth
the one that would go flying around their family telling stories about how amazing you are and how much they want to be with you forever
there was also a guy who i used to talk to all the time on an online website he turned out to be a bit of a dick
and when i think about it is like some kind of insecurity about me becoming stupid probably because having it easy in school was one of my few positive traits and i feel these itchespains in the back of my head
i feel good now but this spark of clear mind will not last they come and go along with my depression and will to continue but i have to write it so it stays somewhere maybe i will read it later and remember a self of mine that at one point felt better knew what they liked and said silly things that do not matter
their major problems just seem so minor that many times i forget that they are being serious and my reaction is inappropriate for the situation
once i turned 18 i became a sex worker on twitter to try and support myself through college and met my now partner who fully loves me and supports me
my friend often texts me through the day mostly just sending me videos he found funny but often he will talk to me about his feelings
the dark thoughts of dying would not stop and once you get into that mind frame it feels near impossible to get out perhaps because i do not have anyone else to say different
i am not particularly happy or satisfied with the suggested solutionsthe advice given at the end since for people with mental health problems be it depression social anxiety disorder avoidant personality disorder etc would have a hard time following the advice given
he used to call me names like call me a bitch or a piece of shit etc etc this happened fairly regularly toward the end
i am mostly clean for now but still have occasional relapses and while i do carry no remorseful thoughts towards my mother nor my middle school bullies anymore but i just want them to accept how they have impacted me as a person and will continue to be so until i die with my scars to remind me everyday
before her i was never really religious was baptized as a child but never went to church but tonight started with a christmas with family masks 6feet and everything i was fine
so far i have come to the conclusion that i am antisocial i see that in my everyday interactions i need to be alone most of the time and either in silence if outside or by doing whatever inside
the most haunting thing since my moms death has always been the thought that i am one step away from being an orphan

i have been repeatedly told i am a psychopath due to the ability to choose who i am empathetic towards i can watch someone get stabbed and feel nothing
we liked the same things history philosophy politics we had different opinions though but this in my mind back then made things more
the breakup has torn me apart badly because it was so completely out of the blue and followed nothing but a great relationship in all ways imaginable with the woman i thought i was going to marry no warning signs and no reason other than she does not see us together in the future anymore she will not tell me anything more than that
i wrote them a long message about it and confessed i finally had the skills needed to interact with people but i found myself prefering isolation

this past weekend i broke it off because in spite of all the wonderful things he was and did there were too many bad things that i could not overlook anymore feel free to see my previous post
i used this breakup to get an excuse to not have to visit family that weekend now when i think about it i feel like a piece of crap
all my friends are either already in a relationship or getting engaged i used to say that in you can not meet a real girlfriend that you actually love and hang out with until you are older but here i am 24 year old still a student having my own place and never had a relationship

it is a different kind of pain confusion and mental battle dealing with december after losing so many people in the biggest month of the year we can not give up we do have people that love us and need usdecemberspainmentalstrugglesstaystrong
i apologise if i gave you experts useless information i have just gone back to essentially having sleepless nights minimal eating loss of interest in my hobbies and just her been on my mind a lot once again so overall i want an honest view from someone as i just have a feeling my mates are just telling me what i want to hear

i do not know what to do to feel better we can both be miserable but she does not seem to get that
she was waiting for me to answer and ended up scolding me about my manners while i just cried i still can not wish anyone a good morning
when we broke up i was 113 kg now i am 81 and to be honest it does not feel better at all
i am starting to get worried since i do not think that getting terrified from a memory from a few years ago can make someone very scared as if that event is happening right now
i told my boyfriend about it he too just could not understand and i felt ok some people might not understand it but atleast he loves me
in the beginning she would ask it herself sometimes and was really exciting but after like 3 weeks she became really toxic towards me and started avoiding me
everyone just pretends to understand you but no one does i knew she was 17 but i just went with it
i just do not want to hurt them i am tired of seeing them get exhausted and drained because of me and my baggage
i am just confused because he continues to send me good morning texts every morning and texts me throughout the day
sorry if this seemed like a ranti just hope i am not alone i just need somone to talk tomy girlfriend has social anxiety which flares up often and struggles a lot with jealousy
nevertheless i was under a lot of stress at the time and my anxiety was bad enough that i was suffering regular panic attacks
i just want to put it out there without messaging you that i am thinking of you and the whole family today stay strong
unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better it is not because even if you do not know what someone is going through you have to show you care to make that persons day even a little better
in saying that i do have my lowswhich it seems like most people have my only confusion is that for most people there generally seems to be some kind of event that the feeling of that depression is connected too i
the rational part of me knows that these feelings are irrational that the possibility of something like that is very low
i feel like such a dick ungrateful annoying always causing problems i feel like i am always overreacting but i really do not know how to stop that
letter you might consider an interim injunction that would make zzzzs birthday way more complicated than they already are that i will not do to you

i have found happiness outside of love and outside of hertldr fiancé of several years and i were making life plans just yesterday and now we are apart
i often kiss girls when i am drunk but it never goes to the next step i do not like sex when i am drunk so i prefer taking their number and see them another day but everytime the conversation that i have with them via messages is so boring and casual that i end up stop talking to them i have had enough of boring conversation when i tried to hookup via tinder
i was in a very long distance realtionship with a girl we both knew eachover for a year and we became a couple for only 2 months i know it may sound strange considering we have not even met but it was the best relationship i have ever been in maybe it was for her
my tought behind it is that it is a nice way to feel abit more motivated to go for a walk out in nature when you can share a picture with other lonley hikers am sorry if this break the rules of this reddit

right before thanksgiving my close cousin died over an overdose and then just a week ago my friend committed by overdose
i do not even know why i got this fucked up disorder it seems like something just switched inside me and i was destined to be lonely for life i honestly might as well be locked up on death row
she would not have to worry about me at all not that she worries about me anyway i was pry just offended or upset which was warranted
my other friendb is doing self harm and no one is there to convince her from not doing it not family nor friends fuck they even said it is fine even though it is very dangerous
i move to another country with my son after some time truth comes out i love traveling my wish was to travel around the world spend all my money and die
she thinks she is fine but she is not help sorry if the flair is wrong btw which it probably is
in some cases it is the lack of fear terror i should say that startles me the most almost like it is mundane and could very easily be the next thing i do
she just treated it like i was an annoying fan which i am but now i am scared she will contact my mum again and i can not take back the aemaol
for now it is just a fantasy and i do not even know if what i think is real or not i do not know if i will ever find someone
but you should not tell yourself it will never endwhen it seems it is you vs the world it is actually you versus yourself
mental illness can be very strange and frightening i have tried to really utilize my time by getting into old hobbies and working on self improvement

allow me to preface what i have to say with a bit of context in middle school i knew someone who i called my best friend
to others who have selfharmed in the past how long did it take for your scars to leavebeen staying at my parents house since april with nothing to do and i hate my life
i just have a nagging feeling of embarrassment that i did that in front of them all do not get me wrong it feels so much better that i got it all of my chest and actually spoke to them about it i just feel so embarrassed
as i lay here in this bed my mind is racing i do not know what to do love hate misery it all just feels like a big blur
granted i never give in to this urge and it subsides after a few minutes is this normal or am i even more unhinged than i already thought i was
what makes this all slightly worse is that the feeling of stress and hate are the first things i have mentally been able to feel for months until now it is all just been an empty numb void i can not fill no matter what i do
i walked out of her room grabbed a blade and went and sit on the bathroom floor but she said she was not changing her mind this fucking sucks and i hate it
on the one hand i worry that asking him to do this for me goes over his boundaries since he is not willing to commit to a relationship
i just reached a point in my life where i feel completely and utterly alone and i fill this loneliness with alcool and other substances just to dampen my thoughts because they can get dark at times and at the moment i am scared of myself scared of the consuming voice within me that keeps pushing me down
he kind of inspired me to get into death metal and heavier music rest in peace bro meanwhile i dreamt about her all night last night i am so hurt i am so mad
the heartbreak of being truly alone for christmas for those who live by themselves what are you doing in this crappy situation
i would not wish this feeling on my worst enemy i find myself staying at work late just to avoid being in my house alone
all the medical professionals tell me that i seem to know my internal struggles and articulate them quite well i can come to terms with past traumas and forgive people
and i might give my all to people and i will never be able to receive that backidk if i should have posted this on here or in relationship advice but here we go
i will still continue to work on myself but some days are so hard without him and learning to let go of what i love and hold so dear to me
i am wondering if there is a way i could help her with what she needs and hopefully get back together she is just the most loving person i ever met more than my own mother and i just do not really know what to do she says it is possible in the future but i want to make it happen
it is not because i think i need one to be happy that is something i am very against but i would be nice to look forward to someone

i got a new job and talking to people has made me overthink a lot at night and i have a very loving and understanding boyfriend but sometimes i get really anxious and worried that one day he is just going to leave because of this but note he has always been there for me and never done anything to make me think this
i could not handle that so i took the initiative and dumped them but that is beside the point i woke in absolute shock and cried for at least a few hours
although i can not help but think i have ruined his life he is convinced me could i of done more i am torturing myself and ended up on antidepressants
i do not even know why i am writing this post it is just that life has become so boring and lonely since the last two years
thanks for reading and in advance for any suggestions started to listen to let us plays just so i could hear voices
i have been to the hospital a few times because of it but i do not have the money for it this time and i need to go to work to provide for my puppy
what the title says basically i am always tired i constantly have suicidal thoughts and have the need to sh again i do not sh since many months now i have wanted to die since i can remember maybe i sound selfish but i have friends a family that loves me but i just want to die if i did not have a family or friends i would have already committed suicide
it sucks i feel like i always have to be understanding and when i do understand the reasons why they chose to do what they did why they do what they do i start becoming confused as hell i start feeling shame and guilt then i am like wait if this is not this persons fault because of herhis struggles then who is to blame for the horrible things that happened to me
and when i think about those last three months before we broke up i did not look at him the way he still looked at me
edit i forgot my best friend also got pregant with 17 from her exif you are reading this know i have and will always love you even if you never loved me
recently i even started hoping for any kind of romantic love in my life even if it is unrequited we took a trip out of state in august and were planning on moving to that state together
meanwhile i felt completely and utterly abandoned by the one person i cherished most on this planet a combination of duromine a speed based apetite suppressant very heavy lifting in the gym and heartbreak sent me to the hospital for a potential cluster of pains resembling something that looked like a stroke
he did send me a goodbye gift apologizing and thanking me for everything my friend told me that guys are simple and not to overthink it
i asked him if he wanted to be official and he said no and asked me if it was okay for me to wait three more months
he on the other hand is about to go to dental school i have written on here about at least 45 times prior to this
i want you guys to debate about a stoicist opinion on the topic in order to find solutions to this problem if you are familiar with filosophy and stoicism feel free to enlighten us v perhaps i am even getting stoicism wrong lol
i know that i am being naïve but i have had abandonment anxiety since my childhood my self esteem is very low at the moment maybe i need a little back support
i often yearn for the feeling of having you close by even on the days when we were immersed in our own work i loved the feeling of knowing that you were simply within arms reach i could look up and meet your eyes for a quick silent exchange those exchanges were my favorite because my heart would double in size and beat out of my chest
surprisingly despite what millions of gurus or experts preach it is incredibly easy to start with meditation and you do not need any fancy gear for it
i am sorry if i confuse you at any part during this please ask me to elaborate on anything that does not completely add up
some stuff happened that i will not go into detail about since that causes my mental state to go back but my first instinct was to do damage in some way but before i could got too deep into that thought i remembered underage drinking will not land me as much prison time as starting a fire
please do not focus on the pain you feel now focus on yourselfi felt okay yesterday but i want to end it rn
yep 11 months of a good relationship and then she decided to take a time because she felt she could not handle with a guy like me she though i was too much for her i always said i do not want you to be perfect i just want you to be yourself she never felt that confident
edit like i said i met her online she lives in nyc and i live in jersey i have her on snapchat but according to her she deleted all other social media and i do not have any mutual friends with her
i have not told anybody about that i think that will be one of my little secrets but that is now what i want to talk about
i went on holyday with a friend and for the first time i met a guy at the disco and he told me he liked me but the following day i went back home now in my country all alone i feel so sad i met a cool guy who liked me and i lost him
2 my low selfesteem i notice every so often that i truly believe nobody wants to speak to me nobodys interested in myself that i am not as good as someone else and why the heck people would want to have friend or lover like me
i have this problem with many other words as well and sometimes it makes it difficult for me to be understood in conversation because i just can not bring myself to say certain words
i had a nightmare but not like all of the ones i have been having this one is differenti am with my friends we are hanging out and talking
i have had suicidal thoughts for years but this is the first time i actually think i might do it my future is ruined
what if during this healing process i lose her as a friend because of the time apart even before we started dating we were already talking to each other almost everyday
i have been bottled up way too long mood swings do not help me they make things worse making my emotions erupt and making me laughcryget angry uncontrollably for no reason i have been blaming myself for something i know is not my fault i know it is not
a few months pass and a couple of days ago we talked and he confided in me that he really wants to change and that he hates being the tough guy
as i lay slowly descending into darkness even madness i blame myself forever to be swallowed my only wish is that you never knew what could be what was sacrificed what you gave up
life is just a circle of one bit of bullshit after another where we are sold even more bullshit to make us feel marginally better about ourselves
i have also met someone new or someone is tinder has worked a lot better than i thought it would but now it is harder i am scared of opening up and i feel a fraud it is just all so complicated in my feelings and head and i really want that peace i had with her
he claims to still love and care for me but his actions show otherwise nothing is stimulating at all everythings numb
3 find people who share common interests to you on sites such as meetuphttpswwwmeetupcom where many meetups have gone online during covid it is a lot easier to find people you click with when you have a shared love of something for example i have found that i usually click with people who love to board game and the process of playing a game together helps to form a strong connection fast
i feel so fucking empty and everytime i go to sleep i do not want to wake up in the morning i can not deal with the idea of new years eve and seeing the new year in people say this is normal and you will find someone else i do not want anyone else i just want her
i am always at least second priority to everything i do not even have any energy anymore even now my heads telling me i am doing this for attention
today is the three months three days mark and i just feel like it was yesterday when he told me that he does not love me as much as i love him
but he started to cry and said to me that he love me i am very kind person or used to be so i decided to stay with him
but i also do not call people very often that everything that was wrong with me was me and that would not have happened if it was not my fault
and then there is the hope that your ex will want to get back together well news flash if it was a long relationship they probably do that is why they are not texting you back it hurts so goddamn much my ex called me crying and i had to tell her to give space because inside i wanted to throw myself off a building whenever she talked because i realized were were not together
i just went through a breakup i was the dumper the relationship was not good for me i broke up with my boyfriend
anyway i just found out that 7 days after we broke up she had sex with a mutual friend and then 3 days later went on a date with a guy and they are now seeing one another
fuck everyone i want to die aaaahhhhh i must have antisocial personality disorder or something but either way i know that i am getting worse
i asked him why he said it is nothing i do or say he tried to rationalize it but he just does not feel the same
i went over to her house and had dinner with her family a lot and watched movies and spending that time with her really made the connection we had stronger
but i do have regrets about holding onto fear and anger and cold feet and becoming distant when we were going through the hard times
i used to have vivid nightmares where i would see awful things happen and wake up in sweats heavy chest or screaming
start with an hour a day focusing on the song of choice that you love so much that no matter how you feel you will love to listen to it
it is like a switch goes off and i can not go back on it it is not strictly while hanging out with people it happens when i am alone aswell just not as noticeable
tired of trying my best just to fall again and again and i have been taught that asking for help is weakness
i am currently in the marine corps and have been in for the past 8 years this coming march i will be transitioning back to the real world
our anniversary is coming up on dec 3rd and idk if i should break no contactthe only way out is through itnot around itgrieve cry feel the damn pain do not hurt yourself

each week we pick a meaningful topic to discuss anyone can sign up to be a guest speaker we are not professional licensed to give you advice
and putting the screen on my family room tv so i feel like they are with me instead of on my cell phone screen
sitting in your feelings sitting in your pain is such a strength it has taken me time through the constant self induced numbing defence mindset and saying i am ok when really i was not that is ok i am still learning who i am everyday i am still feeling pain sadness and all the feels everyday
sadly it still feels like there is a huge part of life that i am going to miss out on and as time goes by the shit hasat least in my mind caused me to have really bad anxiety loss of interest in damn near everything and every day feels like a track on repeat
i feel a bit envious of people who actually have families who care like if somebody has nothing else going on for them who could they fall back on their family but i do not have that i never had that
since i can not say it to him i leave it here not doing well tonight the reason i am choosing to not talk to him and open the wound is because i care
i do not have friends family does not give much support my bf is amazing but i am emotionally lonely if that is even a thing
i saw one about how the elephant population has doubled and i cried for ages over it i need something because i can not go into next year with no hope and nothing to look forward to
i have felt sick for weeks and want her and all of that back any tips would be nice the girlfriend is not responding my texts snaps and even unfriended me
there has not been a single day where i do not think about it i keep coming back to sites researching about ways
but when i got home i felt like i was going in the same routine i finally had the skills needed to interact with people but i found myself prefering isolation
2 days later my friend asked if she replied when i said no she said i should go online and ask her to talk she replied after 15 mins in short biting sentences i tried to grab at what i did so badly because i never understood the disproportionate hate she felt towards me she asked me to delete all the photos of us
after a week of silence from her my phone pings and like lightning i am reading the worst text message i ever thought i could receive she feels unsafe around me she does not know if she can trust me and the worst of all she was scared of me she mailed me my belongings and her brother picked up her things from my home
i am so lost this is the person i have centered my life around for four years the only person i have ever imagined my adult life with i feel like there is nothing left of me
whether it is christmas or my miserable birthday i always ask for the same giftwishto die and yet it never comes true its fucking infuriating to me god never takes the lives of those who want to go yet he takes the lives of those that do not want to go i do not understand
we are both emotional wrecks and rely on each other to stop the other from killing themselves which i have tried but stopped myself short on multiple occasions
this loneliness is pushing me towards alcoholism and i have started drinking every night i do not even know who i am anymore
i texted him recently to tell him how i missed him and how i missed talking to him probably not a very good idea and he said he was going to be honest with me and told me that he was talking to someone new he said that he respected my feelings and told me that that was happening for him
i am already quite stressed my instincts are telling me to quit when i wake it starts hurting a lot i have nightmares almost every day
i have had a lot of people ignore these methods of communication especially some classmates i know and professors and people all over what do i do to get over this and help myself it just makes me feel negative
i also called him it reminds me of the things i have not done yet and all the things i could have achieved
could someone please help me categorise if this is any kind of health issue or normal human behaviour logically i was also very affectionate and attached to her because she is been my very first ever
in my 26 years of life i have been told more times than i can count that i am pretty and i will be the first to admit that i enjoy the attention
but today i came home to the very quick statement to break up where an explanation involved suggesting that she is tried to talk to me about things many times although never this grave or deep
so my ex and i broke up like 2 or 3 months ago we are still friends were friendshe just said that i am dead to him that it would be better if i am not here anymore
i am writing this with my cowboy boots and jeans on my truck outside but i still feel so lonely and unworthy i always feel this way more whenever i am broken up with
i finally found a decent job after 4 months of searching and she leant on me to get by as she struggled to make new friends and work was hard for
i do not get urge to text you no more soupsnake i loved you but i just feel now that i was in love with a ghost so i do not think about it anymore
i was telling myself that maybe because she is struggling with her work and sickness so i understand it and willing to support her in any situation or is this just an excuse i made it up for myself but actually she got no effort in our relationship anymore
i am just forever lonely all i do is work and then go home i do not fit in with the people fron work apart from a couple and i am sure they know this so i am forever missed from any invites
would sending a long text message with my thoughts be too cold should i do this over a phone call these questions seem stupid but i do not have much experience breaking up
how can i expect my friends to know my pain when i barely understand why i feel this way i should be happy but i am not
i was dumped from my long term relationship back in july he was my first real love and boyfriend and i took it extremely poorly went to therapy and everything
i do not know when the pain will stop all i can do is hope that one day i will be free from this
i have never had many friends never had a relationship and my health keeps me in too often i just want a life again with someone to hold it is been too long
i have 3 friends admittedly the best friends a guy could have but that is all i have i hate my family
i originally picked my 30th birthday a month before the actual date so people do not remember me on my birthday but that is a good 4 years away and i feel more desperate than ever
planning on how to transfer the funds needed for flight expenses even if it meant the possibility existed that i have might ghost him
anything tangible anything material might make ones life easy or save one some time even watching a new movie i will find my mind wandering away
my only wish is that your ghost will haunt me so that i can have a tiny piece of what once was
i keep saying i do not want to but they keep saying you will be all alone here and you have family there
i am looking forward to us getting married one day i am so keen on the idea of us being together forever and our wedding one day
i went home they gave me some meds and talked to a therapist since then i am starting to feel way better
i believe there was a time i told her i have blood related disorder but not sure if she still remember
but i do not have the energy for anything i do not even have the energy to clean up my roomi hate myself for it but i do not know how to get out of this
even some people at my job said are you new here that just goes to show how unnoticed i really am
as a 22year old virgin who has only had one truly traumatic first kiss these sorts of comments really upset me and make me feel like i am genuinely unwanted they make me feel as though i am defined by my sexual immaturity and that a woman could not love me if i was not good in bed which obviously i will not be having never had any kind of romantic experience with anyone
i wanted a painless death but i could never get my hands on the sleeping pills i dropped out of college i quit my job because i hate dealing with customers
i wrote what i thought would be my suicide note one year ago and gave myself an ultimatum that i would kill myself before the end of the next year if things did not improve
i have had it with people treating me like crap and just want to end it in new years not sure really what to do since i always bail when i am actually about to attempt it
now i am 25 i am more mature about my mental health and loneliness i carefully try take care of my mental by engaging in hobbies trying to eat regularly and actively try to sleep well complete opposite of how i have lived until now i often get flashbacks of so many opportunities i had to build great friendships with really really great people none of which i ever navigated well enough to build thay friendship
and there is no comfort in any of it the highs make me feel too fast for my own skull the lows make me suicidal
just fyi he is suffering from depression and anxiety he is a sensitive guy and i am kind of a tough woman
have any of you ever dated a man with a backbone so fragile that whenever conflicts arise he just tends to dissappear this is now the second time that this man has straight up just left and has not said a word to me
i served in a church so many years trying to help others by doing social work but i decided to leave due to many reasons
i do not want to drop out because i can not afford to and i can not work in my chosen field without a degree
yes there were times in the relationship where we both hurt eachother but overall i know we really cared for one another
somehow i felt extremely offend after that like all of my preparation just useless because she did not want me hear my whole speech
i got out on a hospital pass one day i remember pretending i was getting better but i still wanted to die everyday i saw something that triggered me and i jumped off the ledge
the dead line was nov 16th i think and i am guessing he faxed it in since the papers were still there
that night i drop him off home and immediately hear yelling he is going crazy at my mom asking her why he is calling her
the biggest problem is that i do not want to be that geeky nerd with narrowminded interests and a lack of friends
the worst case scenario for you is i do not move the whole universe for you anymore and that is ok because i am doing ok
when i want romantic relationships i do not want platonic relationshipswhen i want platonic relationships i do not want romantic relationships i then later dreamt about her that night it made me realize something very important
did you ever realise how to retain a friendly relationship sorry for my english i am not a native speaker others i need to be high i need to be drunk or asleep
i could not think of anything more perfect then starting 2021 in the way that i want the rest of our lives going
my mom left and i went to him and said sorry and that i love him and also gave him a kiss
we were each others perfect match passionate about the same things had the same vision for our future healthy and happy or so i thought
keep focusing on your breath it may even help to say zero when you reach the end of your inhale and one when you reach the end of your exhale again think of nothing but your breath and how it feels when it goes in and out of your body
i am not sure how to get over this wall i do not know what to do we try to hide them and put them away
he kept pushing me to tell him what was wrong with me and i told him i want help for my issues
i work really hard to try to be open about my struggles with those closest to me so that they can have some understanding for why i may be acting a certain way at any point as i never want anyone to take it personally
he is the absolute best person on earth and i can not believe i ruined it when we were happy we were both the happiest we have ever been
but that is just a distraction that there really is no point to anythingis like limiting yourself to only doing the same thing over and over again forever
but after some time it started to bore mei do not know why i am so weird why i do not have any friends
i had a great year i struggled a lot with loneliness but overall it was great i took a year more this year
i had lost sight of who i was who i wanted to be and became what i felt i needed to be
to my ex i broke up with you twice and you do not want me nowlately i have been reading a lot about the universe evolution consciousness spacejust about anything sciencey
i have commit so many crimes that i have somehow gotten away with i did not even comprehend how awful i was and how lucky i was to get away with it until recently
i kind of think he keeps on deleting and redownloading the app just to stalk me bc i keep on changing my icon and just so you know that is the only social media where we share our pics bc he does not have facebook or instagram etc
i hope by new years i can think of a better way either to live or to die but like usual i do not think i should get my hopes up
for regular people i am just a lowlife that will eventually commit suicide and they can live the rest of their lives in happiness
i do not know what to say anymore sorry thank you so much for reading it hurts knowing that i let this happen and it is almost like another persona was born
honestly i still miss her and i went through some panic attacks too but now i love myself i started to respect my very own existence as a human being
i learnt the meaning of kindness from her she wasis i do not know what to use everyone liked my jokes and stories i was the independently popular girl
they are pretty much all leaving today and i just feel already so boreddepressedunmotivatedi have already felt so lonely this year because my family is so far
tldr i was lonely and depressed lost my home and my job gave up on working out and making music wasted my money on drugs met a drug dealer who i trusted but he did not care about me i overdosed at his place all of this is very unlike me actually and i am scared and disappointed to see who i have become i am 24
what does this mean what should i do i do have a history with depression and suicidal thoughts in case that may be related in some way
i am learning to be okay with that because i truly loved her that is just a fact we planned on getting married building a future together
tonight is christmas eve and for the first time in my life i am alone tomorrow i wake up a lone
i did not buy it and did not speak after that first thing next morning she packed her stuff and left
i want to fucking die i will never be able to get shorter get smaller feet smaller hands a feminine face give birth have a smaller rib cage wide hips a short body a hairless body a smaller skull feminine hairline small nose soft skin or anything because testorome ruined my fucking body i hate it so fucking much
next year i am graduating and then i am going to college i believe i will find some friends there i have to
fast forward a year i grew up in a black community me being white things were not easy my school of 600 students i was 1 of maybe 15 whites about 200 spanishlatino rest being of black origin i had to fight a lot at a young age but the community accepted me and my mom fairly quick i missed a lot of school and honestly for the next 5 years i was on a downwards path i started drinking and smoking weed at 12 by 14 i was into xanax and lean my mother met a ms13 member for those who do not know what that is
this in a sense is one of the greatest ailments of our time a major social disease of the modern society that we would do well to cure it before it is too late if the danger remains unheeded then like poisonous chemicals in our food it may increase from generation to generation until the damage has gone beyond repair
i loved the attention it gave me the constant reassurance that i was loved and pretty though this did not last long as i met my first serious boyfriend
anyone who is reading this will instantly say that nothing can happen right now but love is something which keeps your hopes up
i agree that everybody needs someone by their side and having friends i do not think solves that problem you have this urge to always find somebody where you think to yourself being with them might solve the problem but you know i am not sure toosome might be lucky to be with someone or other from time to time and i guess those are the lucky ones
i personally do they felt so alone and had no one to turn too so they pent up all that anger and exploded
he unblocked the girl that was a recurring issue in our relationship the girl tht alwas felt like the apple of his eyes while i was the gf when he promised he would not
had an experience today i have had quite a few times i was hanging out in a discord voice chat with a friend talking about the mandalorian
i just hurt myself when i feel negative until i stop feeling that way it never feels good enough i always have to do more
when we made it out to the car my uncle had come out for a smoke break and i started to scream at my mom to get out of the driveway as fast as possible terrified he might try to stop and talk to us
and now it is just over i hate myself so much i hate that i was not good enough for himbeen week 4 since our breakup he moved out
i kind of felt that in all these 1 year 10 months of dating each other he never understood me because why otherwise would my trauma response feel like a selfish action to them am i overreacting please help
i have spent my whole life alone with about 2 friends who do not even care about me that much my girlfriend just broke up with me and i feel so empty and more alone than before
almost ready to transfer to another college for my career that is psychology in berkeley jump to early 2020 and the pandemic has started and forcing quarantine for many to protect us all
woke up crying this morning and i could not breathe have felt deeply lifeless today i just want it all to be over
my goal is to end it positively so i keep making new accountsi will note here than i am not an incel
anyways here comes now my problem at the beginning of this year my best friend helped me getting back to therapy i can really recommend it and was there for me in general it was okay i have got the help i needed and advice but at this time around my friend also got together with her now boyfriend aaand also her education started it turned out her boyfriend has also pretty many mental problems yay x
a bunch of transient people in my life who do not want to be there i am 18 now and being ugly is always going to take a toll on me i just keep obsessing over it
i am scared that maybe this was all pointless and i am just doomed in this endless cycle i am asking for some support and maybe your personal life advice on this subject
they just call me crazy and do not give a fuck about my mental illness you can talk to us about anything
i didt ask to be born i fucking hate life and everything to do with it its so boring and repetitive
finally he brought up the idea of being in a relationship this one is completely my fault it was getting serious so i opened up about my health condition
i wish things would have worked out but maybe it was just the wrong time and that is ok if it is meant to be we will find each other again but for now i need myself
i have studied psychology and currently doing counseling and research in digital mental health i know how it feels to be feel alone in the holiday season it is strange sometimes how lonely we can feel even though we are surrounded by people
i quit drinking two months ago and life just seems hopeless especially the futurei am 23 and everything is hopeless and i am completely alone
i was on nd hathe streets for a month that was awful and made me want to die every single day
often wondered what it was like to have a group that cares and what not well recently made a friend did not feel lonely and he brought out the best in me
around june this year i received a message of liz she heard a lot of rumours about me and my ex but it turned out that my ex denied every story
i never talked about these things with anyone and they never asked it was a two way street but i was the only one affected
and then i think we will it is kind of true what hobbies do i have other than drinking and dancing and smoking and eating
i mean if i meet a great person who i want to be with how can i make sure that my insecurities pain etc will not affect it
so i cut myself obviously but my year 11 formal is coming up where you have to take a girl out i have not had friends for years so socializing is not an option i do not have socail media and its extremely hard to fit in i am planning on cutting my arm pretty bad so i do not have to go can someone help
i mean i know what other people would do all my conversations in messenger are about me giving information that they need for school and that is it
when my mom found out that i actually cut she started making statements like what did we do wrong and she told my sis that i attempted suicide
idk how to stop myself from sending him stuff even though he will look and not respond i sent him one this past weekend
i sleep the entire day or stare at my phone this is literally the only place i could get help from
not a band kid a pure genuine class clown everyone liked my jokes and stories i will never forgive myself i hope you let me speak to you
here is how it happened yesterday i was doing data entry which is less tasking so i naturally found something to occupy myself
its so hard to get up in the morning put that fake smile on and act like i am fine the whole day i really just can not do it anymore i do not want to be here i just want to find a way to leave without people knowing i did it that is not how i want to be remembered
the teacher called the names and distributed the marked answer sheets of all the students of my classroom one by one
i have always had this issue of trying to visualise something in my brain but it never happening how i want it to happen it is like my brain fights against me for example when trying to imagine something simple such as a man jumping down a hole the environment distorts to stop him grabbing at his legs and tangling him up or an invisible film or elastic force field pushes him back up
today my emotions felt numb and forced i was sad about something but i could not even stay focused on feeling sad i have things that i do feel sad about but it feels forced
it is nearly impossible for me to put my foot in the convo and say that i am not acc attracted to them because i am so awkward ndjdjd and i also know that if i do i will be alone again because i have no friends
i recall the night this happened my father left me a message i am finished take care of your mother and our family and shut off his phone
however i feel like this deep deep hurt that will not leave would just become the norm is it worth pursuing or am i just caught dreaming about what could have been
for the past few months i have just been finding it difficult to concentrate and be productive i am in my final year of high school and i just find it really really difficult to get work done or focus on studying myself
i would just go ahead and kill myself but i care too much about the people around me and those who love me
i am not going to give up though i am not going to kill myself though maybe that is the problem that i do not want to end it and i guess that is fine because who cares if you sad right
if you have come that far i can not thank you enough thank you for your time and for caring i rarely break even in the amount of suffering even less to the point of having good days
it felt nice knowing that there was at least one person who cared for me romanticallyit feels relieving in a way knowing i can always just take those pills and everything will stop
he just continued to say that he can not date that dating makes him unhaooy with no further explanationi am so pissed off everybody judges you
anyways one of my breakdowns inspired me to make this short video 1 minute long about how i really feel my current mindset watch if you would like i hope at least some of you all can relate
i could not even get into the college i wanted to study in even after working so hard and now i am just wasting my parents money pretending to understand all these classes
all that aside i thought i would go outside and make some friends and at work i go to bars to talk to some people not even for hookups so i could make friends with other groups of people or other people in general the moment i try to talk they distance themselves subtly like i am not a cool guy to talk to
do people really just not care about other peoples visions and dreams i always get so excited for friends and family when they express their dreams to me but when it comes to mine ha let us get everyone around and just laugh at the jokester
it gives me chills to imagine how many stories are hidden out there just thinking of other people doing the most mundane things makes me smile
i set up an appointment with a therapist a month ago but the only available time was in mid january i just need to hold out but it feels like i can not
if you died who would make sure all of the other suicidal kids did not kill themselves who would give them motivation who would help them understand that life is worth it and that they are worth it if you died what would stop them
being discriminated is something i deal with daily i have not done people anything and still they want me to get the out
was agitated irritable angry and the world seemed dark strong feelings of dread and a sense of despairit did not last too long happened earlier today but it feels like a psychological wound that was healing opened up a little bit
i last told her she also had to let me go she ignored my message but does that and the guilt from how it ended and her cheating keep her from reaching out
i want to give you time to be alright and everything then we will start from there it is all going to work out i promise
somehow or the other i am going to get thru the tail end of this dumpster fire of a year and look forward to spring
friends keep asking me if i am sure it is over yes i am but i think because of how nice he was they can not understand why i would end it
has anybody on here tried lucid dreaming to experience friendships and or relationships i have thought about doing it and i just wanted to know if it is worked for anybody or how it went
it hurts so much because i would never do this to him i try to block and i end up with millions of unsaved paragraphs in my notes
she was surprised and gave me a bottle of water and watch me as i take my meds he is a sensitive guy and i am kind of a tough woman
for sure i was angry about it and stopped talking for a biti just want to be kissed once before i die
i have never really had any good friends ever and the few people i consider my friends do not really care and only need me when their going through shit otherwise i will not hear a word from them i just feel like there is something wrong with me and i will never be able to form actual relationships in my life
they have both self harmed and not gotten as addicted to it as i am but still started deleting fb friends being super cranky and angry
a close friend of mine who is 15 i am 16 committed suicide this has taken a huge mental toll on me
i had said that i wanted some time to rethink over some things with out relationship since things were getting complicated between us
you moved away for a job and i resented you for it you were so sweet and loving it might seem silly to say it but why should i not i kind of need to
i do not know when it started but i can barely remember anything that happened to me this week it is all a blur i have to think really hard about what i did
i have expressed part of this to him and all he tells me is that hell wait which adds a further burden to me
now that has become an absolute obsession and it is literally making me miserable that i am still renting despite the fact that i was absolutely fine with it 3 months ago
i also have more days though that i will always be miserable sad lonely and angry i have always never had much patience when it comes to my kids
please if you have any suggestions tips or anything you think would be useful to me a reply or pm would be greatly appreciated
i go to the gym almost every day and eat very healthy this is ruined my schedule and broken my heart
being the emotional support for my friend and then for family has gotten too much too much negativity at home and in life itself
i was so confident that we would be able to have something special from a year of connecting as amazing friends we both confessed our love but i was hesitant
however as time as gone on i have begun developing feelings for him i have anxiety and feelings of insecurity so not knowing if he has deeper feelings for me or wants to date me and the like is eating me up inside
i have never had a laptop that would be a considered a status symbol with laptops becoming common and my laptops do not even qualify as ultrabooks but i had a terror of having a laptop that could embarrass me with a chipped corner or glue residue on the palmrest or a slightly imperfect screen because it made me feel like someone who could not afford better or could not take care of his belongings
i do not know how to fix this i feel i am stupid worthless i will never get a job i lost so many years doing nothing
my mom got sick and there was a huge blow up when i insisted she go to the hospital huge fight breaks out from when they came home to 3 days later
but i like to get a few things off my chest in november before thanksgiving my aunt passed away and she was one of my favorite people on this planet her death hit me so hard
i remember always telling her you will never see me angry i may be mad but i will never be angry around you and what a fucking lie that was
i have overdosed before but i have never taken this mucheven if i wake up tomorrow i will probably damage my organs or something or i will vomit
i feel like she deserved better someone who was not always anxious about every single thing she would say or do and i feel i deserved a way to not constantly feeling like i have a bag of bricks on my back
but it is so hard for me to see the man i loved slowly getting more and more distantbest thing i never had irreplaceable beyoncei forgot that you existed mean taylor swift
i often feel lonely probably as a result of my insecurities that result in my unwillingness to meet people i think bad about myself precisely about how i look
but i was also focused and determined about earning money online which was a flop to support my family so i could not really spend time on the piano without feeling like i was wasting time
i am not ready to accept that love is not enough sometimes breaking no contact does help but that is just for me personally
she thanked me for meeting her and said it helped her reconcile with her feelings and preserve me as the happiest memory
i find it harder and harder to actually put in the effort to get back out there dating and sex have been a hard no pass
i was enjoying chatting to chicks i met online and using a video chat app which is now a haven for foreign strippers
i am feeling weird about myself because it is a neverending cycle hits whenever it likes sometimes i am super good sometimes super bad
he never wanted to hold my hand it is just not something he doeshe always called me by my name where i called him bunny
but i could never really change anything not for myself i tried to distract myself with school and my hobbies but it is not enough i have no motivation anymore
she is so ambitious smart funny generous caring thoughtful and literally everything i have ever wanted in a wife she is so gorgeous to add to all of that too
this is the first christmas eve christmas i have not spent with my two beautiful boys so many more to come without them it seems
he replied immediately and apologized told me that something came up with his brother and that he will not be able to make it how incredibly sorry he was and if we could make it tomorrow with the promise not to cancel this time
i ask myself when will i stop looking for you when will i be able to leave the safety of my four walls for the sake of leaving and not to meet you it will likely be months maybe even years i think about how you might be looking into someone elses eyes and feeling the same excitement and adrenaline i felt when looking into yours i should not but i do
few hours later he blocked me on instagram and his guy friend messaged asking why i dumped him and that he is never seen him like that before over someone so he hopes we work it out
i can not think of a time when i felt happy like actually happy and not happy but still hating myself i feel like the only reason i have not hurt myself yet is because i can just do it later it feels like it is always on the horizon sorry if this is all over i just want to get this feeling out
these days munchausen syndrome is formally called factitious disorder imposed on self according to the dsm v diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5th edition it is formally defined as falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms or induction of injury or disease associated with identified deception in the absence of obvious external rewards
i have always felt alone in life being a different skin colour in a small country town was always bullied for the way i looked or talked parents divorced when i was 6 and somehow remember all of it
this time really felt different you know i am in my late twenties and have not had a full relationship in a few years
i hate the fucking shakes and shortness of breath i get but i love not feeling dysphoricbritish pubs were closed march 20 so i missed out there
went through a break up right before this whole mess moved across the country to give myself space to heal and so i would not end up in a drunken high stupor for months now dealing with extreme isolation and mourning the breakup still can not really talk to people about it because i am told to get over it
but when he saw my cut last june the one i had to get the tt for he knew what it was and told my mom that it was me who did it
at the time i felt i just needed someone to spend time with that was my age and who i wanted to go wine and dine go to the movies go on roadtirps and etc did not do this with older woman bc it embarrassed both of us
or am i fooling myself that it is even possible i sleep eat play work dinner relax all in my room since then
sorry for the long post but i could write forever thank you if you read the entire thing i wish you the best in life
today the day after christmas i still miss you but i know i can not keep thinking of you and i need to move on from all the love and hurt i got from you
this morning was weird i woke up so excited that i have almost made it 7 days on my truly first attempt of a pmo cleanse i began rummaging through twitter for news and stumble upon news of a celebrity leak scandal
it is beginning to feel like that time will never come not to do fun stuff to call me boring in a place that is boring
at first she thought that she felt that way about him because she had problems with me but now she told me that she was crushing
i had a lot of suicd tries in this time and i really did not know how to talk about this with her
where she lives there are apparently no people she likes as much as she likes me and i just do not know what to say
yet she has not contacted me at all while doing this i have since muted her stories so that i do not give her the attention she wants
i want this to end cuz its killing me and it would actually kill me cuz i have been thinking of ending it once and for all
sounds ridiculous but he had been absent from our relationship for almost half a year and i used that time to selfreflect and also deal with my deteriorating mental emotional health and had came to conclusion that i do not need someone who does not need me in his life
how can i free myself from this learn to get aroused by something else make my sexual life active with real people
they may be in pain they may be suffering do not forget after all you made them feel very special but you would be surprised how they move on so quickly and how they will regret leaving you as well later on
yesterday i had a feeling of suicide a quick one thinking about my life going thought a loop endless and if restarting would help me some way
with experiences like that i no longer had the burning motivation to do amazingly well at my job i felt such hatred deep visceral encompassing selfhatred and disdain i could not understand what the fuck happened when i have set out on the journey to become web developer this is not what i imagined my life would look like after succeeding in that quest
on days off i lay in my bed all day and watch random mind numbing tv shows the thought of getting up and putting in effort to socialize is overwhelming
i get random bursts of productivity and i have randomly rearranged my entire room at 3am before because i just felt so productive for some reason
i struggled to even go to work i missed almost 5 weeks of work in 2 months due to waking up every day with the only thought but to take my own life as nothing matters and i have nothing to go on with
telling him that i would been nervous to date again but how wonderful our date was and how happy i was that i would taken a chance on him
i try being positive and the strong one for everyone but it feels like no one is seeing how much i am hurting and that i feel like i am breaking
whenever i get faced with some form of a threatening situation i completely lose my temper i will usually resort to feeling super angry for no apparent reason so angry in fact that i can resort to violence depending on whom has triggered me this intensely
i do not even remember half of the things i bought but i remember i spent lots of money spoiling someone who eventually did not work out
every time we started foreplay we would get 510 minutes in and she would say this is not very good and that she can not get into it and stop
long story short being alone so long is a real morale crusher and yes i have tried tinder grindr zoosk okaycupid etc
it is more like a feeling that just happens to me in a detached manner dominating my internal experience but the part of me that observes this experience recognizes these feelings so i just think oh no it is happening again and wait it out
i suffer from depression and anxiety i told her and for that day she spoke to me but later on it was the same thing
this has been really crazy for me as now i feel like i am guilty and my mind is trying to create a situation that makes me the person who did it
however it is possible to participate in this research project without being recorded the interview is entirely anonymous and nonidentifiable to protect your privacy
now after about two months i am feeling kind of empty my ex and i are still friends same friend group and same school so there are some times where they talk about bumping into someone cute at the store in our group chat and i wonder why that has not happened to me yet
i met my ex in college when we were both 21 we are both 25 now they do not help me at all i am just so tired
i miss you so much i think about you everyday i am trying to move on i really am i hope one day i will be able to live without the thought of you in my mind just remember i will not ever stop loving you thank you for loving me and thank you for everything i will never forget someone who has such a beautiful soul
i was nervous because covid was more of a thing but you somehow convinced me to go and i do not regret it for a second
i would like to know one day from each of them one thing just one positive thing about me as their mom and one positive thing i did during their entire life
no one helped us but ourselves because we need to survive i know he is manipulating me i have done all of his universitys homework because he would emotionally manipulate me
and i am human no matter how much i wish it were the case i was not built to exist in isolation
additionally i feel like i am an imposter in my friend group i feel like none of them actually like me and are just putting up with me because the person who brought me into it is my friend idk maybe i will do it tonight maybe i will not because i am scared i guess we will see were it goes
wirh good i mean no cheating lying or stff like this i mean like when both thought it would be better to just be friends
it also adds the underlying cognitive structure that they were born to go thereit underscores an underlying message of a delusional outlook on what is considered to be evil
emotional brain sais end it because i am just going to suffer more and i can not feel that things are getting better
i enjoyed being your friend for so many years i enjoyed that you were the person i could talk to about everything or almost everything
contemplating what the point is of living life if i genuinely can not connect with others around me and feel so uncomfortable in a social setting
oh do not worry little boy this will come to pass i just am so hurt i want him to run over to my house tears in his eyes apologizing
i am waiting on a call back from the doctor now which in itself is giving me a huge amount of anxiety i have tried meditation which does work in the moment but as soon as it is over i am anxious again i can not focus on anything when i am like this which makes distracting myself very difficult i do try but it is always at the back of my mind
he now questioned me about it and i was in disbelief and just flipped out maybe babe sis it is hormones but he would not just listen to me when i explained everything
so i do not show emotions because of that and people just can not communicate because without showing real emotions there is no room for connection
i mean i have gotten use to it but in moments of selfreflection like this i start to remember how much i wish it was not there
my cat just died he was my reason to live now he is gone i do not think i can hold on any longer i was already suicidal as fuck even when he is alive why him i did not ask him to die oh god pls just let me die living is too painful
i am going to work tomorrow to cover for someone someone died in her family and she is never going to have the chance to go to the funeral if she misses it that day i will do laundry before that too understandable she was going to have a busy day off but the vibes warned me something was wrong
am i overreacting or is this a problem i should be worried about also worth mentioning i get electric shock type pain in the middle of my arm when lifting weights in addition my hands have recently started going numb i explained how i feel all of this is linked together and identifies nerve problems and the doctor said the numbness is likely carpal tunnel and basically ignored the rest
the reality is 99 are fosters and 21 of them are tiny puppies and they are preventing me from killing myself
i am not trying to speak from a point of perfection i have done a lot of dumb things given into temptation and immediate gratification taken my pain out on others it is awful i wish i did not but maybe knowing more about it helps
i am a 20 year old guy and i cry most nights because i have nobody to talk to and i lack the social skills to actually change it
my gf and i dated for 4 years we meant at 18 and ended a week ago at 22 years of age
lately though he pulled back a lot my mental health has been poor lately i withdrew from college again and i am just kind of a mess
so i would ask you to discuss your views openly during the online interview and i am interested in understanding your opinions
i had a big crush on a guy from another country but he is ignoring me now i do not think he ever liked me and
i am close with my brother but he and his wife live 2 states away i have 2 roommates but the one i am best friends with is gone most of the time
i now have around 59 people that come in every stream a very positive discord and i am doing my first 12 hour stream
when i am depressed i watch so much youtube and i think it is because youtube videos are more personal like vlogslivestreamstwitch streams are kind of like a friend just talking to you about interesting topics it makes me feel less alone does anyone else feel this way
my friend still talks to her and tells me that she is falling apart that me not being around the house is fucking with her
i feel so many emotions about this man that i can not say i am angry or i am depressed about what he done to me or i am happy and in a better place i feel everything i can not pin point a feeling
spending christmas in bed in the dark do not want to be out there just want to be in bed bed is safe and comfortable
so i was wondering if anyone had any advice for learning how to be empathetic in situations like thisthis question has bothered me for awhile maybe it is a series of questions
i am asking for some advice on what i should do to move on or just lessen the pain from all these events and if going to the get together or not going to it would be beneficial i just want other perspectives on all of this and try to compile my thoughts to make the right choices thank you for your time guys
when you are so lonely for so long and you become deprived of just a hug or a hello it turns you into a sour person and you will do anything to get a bit of attention
i am looking for any suggestions on books to read podcasts to listen to anything to try and get me out of this place
all i have been able to think about is what if we do not get back together i will not carry his last name
i am up at 510 am on christmas day typing this out while listening to russian doomer music i am a sadantisocialoverthinkerinsecureworryingmadhateful jealous and tiredsleepy sack of shit
the feeling that i was sick made me feel crazy but now i feel like everything has gotten worse because when i think of smth that will make me sad and anxious my stomach starts burning for a sec and my heartbeats feel really heavy until they normalize by themself
we fought a lot in the past few months some even ended with me cutting which made things even worse because i cut too deep and had to get a tt
i do uber eats for work so between that and going to the grocery store and other errands that is the only social interaction i get
always be kind to whoever you come across you never know how much underlying pain they are holding to their heart
i have tried old but it just makes me feel lonelier i have been doing online meetups which are nice but i feel like living with my ex makes everything so hard i am so lonely i do not know what to do anymore
i know this has nothing to do with what i am struggling with but it is one of the reasons why i have mental health problems
i just need some opinions but in a situation like this is it normal to try to piece together a situation in your head that makes you the guilty party because i have done this numerous times in my life
i mean come on he is a pretty big part of why this happened he has nothing to be proud about partially stealing someone is girlfriend partially because not only he was interested in and tried with her but she happened to also like him in return
my boyfriend of 3 months broke up with me because of my neediness during the quarantine i do understand and i am trying to change that
but trust me when i tell you was the happiest day of my life for the first time i felt that someone was really carried about me i felt safe
i am m17 and am not sure if i am suffering from derealization depersonalization i hate to be one of those highschoolers to self diagnose but i need help and i am too afraid to ask my parents
i said yes and told her everything that i still have feelings i can not keep going out with her knowing that she is moving on ect
i feel like i am fucking failure so why stay on this earth i make everyone is life worse i do everything wrong i can not even help the people that i love because i am such a retard and yet i stay alive for them only for my friends and my bf because i want them to think i am okay
that i only try and be better for a week until i go back to normal and make everything a joke
i am not quite sure how to make a friend it seems or what to do to feel less lonely sometimes i wonder if its you posting behind a screen however my heart is shattered
so to start this off i will talk about my weight i am 58 320lbs currently i am awake it is unhealthy and unattractive but i do not care
took it as maybe we just need a break from each otheri do not believe in demons and if true why would a demon wast it is time like that
i have come to the conclusion my friends either do not like me or have just lost interest in me i have always felt like a background character in my group
i am only staying alive and pretending to be okay because of my girlfriendso i make a new account and tell her but i did change
just alone today and needed to get this off my chest life is crazy like that we moved to michigan 2 months ago where we know absolutely no one nor are we close to anyone here we are all we had and i got caught on some old dirt by a total fluke a christmas to remember for sure
i think my fear and my anxiety started again because i have dated a new girl on this week and something triggered me
i wish i had friends besides my teachers i wish i had gotten along with my familysince then i am just home or at therapy suicidal thoughts haunting me all day
i told my dad about it which my brother got scolded about and we argued again about it till he just told me to just go buy myself some food i mumbled to myself as to why is he the one always in charge he heard that and told my dad that i will be the one that is now in charge and now that is pressuring me as well
or if you see them you see a mistake and a memory m m that they were apart of your life but they are not anymore
i do not hit the gym 6 times per week anymore after a while because i do not love myself anymore and can not live with what i have done so why bother i lost 10 kilos in weight now
since then i just gave up and ended up acting as if i was enjoying it again there is going to be times where i need help or will not mind asking for some
can someone help me i constantly feel like i am in limbo i am so tired of constantly feeling like everything i do is entirely pointless
and i am truly grateful and appreciative for the companionship and love that you showed me through our relationship i asked them to see a physiologist
i took them on an empty stomach and i am 13 115 pounds so idk wtf is on a happen i am really scared
when i research jobs i always get a sick feeling imagining how stressful and unpleasant all of the options are and eventually stop
any thoughts before i lose my reason and start feeling like this is a general behaviour of people i would likento have a truthfull opinion of the female audience on this and please do not be kind with your replies but be truthfull to me i need that
it was for the best i thought tiring myself out from crying would do the trick but my emotions are so heavy right now it is already 436am in where i am living but i am still wide awake
almost everyday my friends would ask me to hang out with them usually just stuck at someone is home doing whatever simple things it was nice served as a distraction from constant rumination
ryzi is still a bit jittery but shinanother alter keeps it under control my mom starts getting frustrated from ryzi constantly claiming she is cutting too much hair off
my heart rejects it like it is the only thing keeping me afloat i know the acceptance of this is the only thing stopping me from healing
i was willing to help pay for that gender reassignment surgery and all of that therapy and the hormones i poured so much love into every single thing i drew for you from day one of our relationship
i have many many friends acquaintances coworkers family who verbalize they adore me and love me on the level of those relationships but no one anywhere ever who has expressed romantic interest
i do not know if i am mentally well i feel like i do everyday but it is been so long that i might not even remember what it feels like to be truly happy because the emotion i felt in that dream is the first time in a long time i have felt it
who am i kidding i thought it would help her to get away from me i would rather die than thisso my ex and i broke up 3
yesterday on facebook i wished them a merry christmas asked how they were doing and if they would like to catch up
if you need help please give them a call and even if you choose to go on with your plans they are going to be by your side to the end
my father who was my best friend died of covid in may my mother is not in good health either and keeps saying how she will die soon too i work a shitty job making nothing while i live with her and my sister who is mentally ill can not work and tried to kill herself in oct and my mom says we will lose the house in the new year too and i will lose my pets
hey everyone i am a phd student who works at a mindfulness lab we have a research wing and also a communal wing where we offer free consultations workshops and initiatives geared towards practical steps in integrating wellness for college students
i could not handle it anymore and felt so used i broke contact again and even blocked him on all social media
at this point it feels like i never raise above the level of hating being alive to experience the pain of this vast emptiness but i can certainly get worse
merry saturnalia eve hello everyone i honestly am not the best example of a health person who has gotten over mentalillnesses however i just wanted to remind everyone that no matter how alone you may feel there are plenty of people going through the same thing willing to talk about or you could even ask if someone can listen to you vent
i feel weak there are people in worse situations than mine and i should just pull my chin up and push through but i can not it hurts too much
i am at the point where i just want to stop i do not want to die horribly but i just really want to stop like its over i am done my life will not get better and i am stucked living without a direction or place in this world i just want to disappear and vanish peacefully i am so frustrated every second that i am aware i am still alive
i am really trying to change and see how much i screwed up this relationship i already begged and pleaded but with no result
i do not know why i do this but i guess it is because i always feel alone i got close to death again so i tried my luck again and it worked out
she was extremely manic and all over the place yesterday normally she is the sweetest most caring loving person i have ever met
i started drinking heavily but after a month it got better we only talked about three times all of them about rent lease and such stuff
i am also terrified to tell them that i developed a tic disorder a bit like a toy she was not considering anymore that she went back to because she was bored
i wanted to call him and cry and hear him tell me everything would be fine and i know that if i did call me he would listen
i do not trust strangers like my classmates and i can not eat at school because i have a feeling they are all taking turns on spitting in my water and touching my food when i am away
i dated this guy for three months and thrived off the bare minimum he gave me zero commitment texting back every few days only willing to meet me on weekends only ever meeting on evenings treating me like a fuckbuddy
she said she resented me and i was the only one who cried while she emotionally shut down at the revelation
like the time i had to shout at my dad to stop when i had to hold his hand and push him away from hurting my mom when i had to listen to my mom tell me how dad beats him continuously during their 20 years of marriage without us knowing how i have to act like drinking water and hide all the knives in the kitchen when i had to hold my dad while he cries saying he is sorry
smoked some weed and it was definitely laced with coke has to be one of the top 3 scariest moments of my life and that is it no more drugs in going clean fuck me fuck that now that it came down i am glad it was just coke but shit that was scary
i feel horrible because i have been telling my significant other i have been taking it the last 3 days we help each other keep track when i have not been
i can not internalize and understand the multiplication of negative numbers as a concept no matter how many videos i have watched for fucks sake
i am just really sad for ruining everyone is dayi really did not mean to she explained the break could be months or years
is there anything like that your mind is forgetting is there anything like that your mind is just ignoring that way you can build a better understanding
and he made such a big deal about how great i was and how attractive he thought i was but i feel like i do not have any good friends i could rely on
we can talk for hours about anything and we just have such good chemistry so i feel like i can not move on or get over him because i truly do believe he is the one for me
sometimes i go days without taking a shower no one cares honestly should not have reached out to make friends just gave me false hopes
change jobs change myself change my environment be more positive hell i even fucking cut out a bunch of fucking people to no avail
this is especially weird as i barely ever cry and i do not think i have ever cried in front of anyone in months if not years
these are two separate things it is like you hired a car and it broke but you still have your own car
so using this fear i am forcing myself not to do the compulsion and the anxiety for not doing the compulsion is gone because the fear of the punishment in case of breaking the promise by doing the compulsion is bigger than not doing the compulsion
i asked what the most effective form of suicide was and instead of answers someone directed me here i am not sure i even understand the purpose of the sub
there is so many resources worksheets portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming i have tried so many different resources over the last year and i still feel like i have seen only a tiny fraction
therapy and getting diagnosed with agoraphobia just instigated a new wave of intrusive thoughts and i do not know what to do
more years and more decades of this shit of being alone and in pain all the god damn time i look at all the happy couples and wonder why it could not be me
i know that i will not always feel this way at some point i tried to see my depression as just another part of me that while has its downsides also provides me with some strengths that not everyone else has
i still believe in you as a person just not in you and me together i just hope you remember who i was and how much i loved you
my parents are both government employees and by the time i was born my sister was a 7 year old kid
tldr my only ex wants to get back and i am unsure if i should or not here is a brief summary of the relationship we had for 1y 3mo
i do not think i am going to make it i have tried to reach out and call for help but no one seems to be listening
but i am finally going to take my drivers license test next week that is a whole other story so hopefully things will get better once i have a little more independence
we both liked eachother so much but he was not ready and i was willing to wait i do not know when i lost feelings but i did
i think she has moved on just few days ago when i wanted to talk to her on whatsapp she replied
she came back from school every now and then and she missed me so much she came back on halloween i later found out that on that day something had changed
it is been more than a month i am finally going through my photos and deleting you out ones i took ones with you and my daughter in it the photosvideos you sent me every day it hurts to look at all the memories and know we will not have anymore there is some photos i can not bare to delete when i am stronger i will get rid of those
1 reach out to old friends you have not talked to in a long time call someone up3 say hi to other masked people when we pass on the street
a lot of times it is important to spend time with your friends with who were your friends before that relationship and surrounding yourself with the energy that does not keep bringing you down and reminding you of that relationship that has just ended
we started out long distance when we first met which was not too bad i say long distance but it was less than a 3 hour drive
most sadly is most the time i can not stand to be sober when i think of it all i know it is a bad copying mechanism but idk if talking about it would even help
we share a room that we just redid and i have been trying to keep it clean and fill it with things we both enjoy
after that we got in a fight and she told me to cool down and that we will talk about it when we next time see each other
the same story goes for disciplining a child to grow up thinking they are going to heavenit overscores an overt message of a delusional outlook on what is considered to be good
2 days after our breakup i found out he is been hanging out with an 18 year old girl not sure if they are officially a thing or not but they are definitely more than just friends
i used like my cousin when i was little but he started verbally abusing me as we grew up i grew up listening to my mom complain about how i could never be as good as him
if you were physically mentally and emotionally connected to that person then it takes a little bit longer and if you were physically mentally emotionally and spiritually connected to that person then it takes the longest time
after a year of living with each other i soon broke up with him and wanted out of the lease when he got hiv karma
the only one who loved me and showed me pure kindness the person who helped me grow but i know i can not
however the past couple of weeks he was in isolation as his mum has covid and we had a little argument when he told me this because i was upset and he was obviously also upset and snapped at me
my ex and i recently broke up he just did not feel the same way about me anymore which is fine
i no longer wish to be seen they say they are all here for me and they care about me but hardly show it
i just went back on my medication i hope it helps because life feels like some twisted cycle only death can free me from
still 160 was not enough i had helped him move out of the house he shared w ex wife and now mom
i took 6 mg because i wanted to feel different and also nothing i do not have tolerance or anything it is my first time taking benzos
i try to minimise suffering whenever i see it in my own life but whenever i see any news of deathsmurderstragedies they really stick with me and i just can not help thinking of all the tortured souls that exist along with me all across the world and how powerless i am because i can not help them
when covid hit and she asked if i wanted to do zoom meetings i told her i was not 100 comfortable because i live in an apartment thin walls usually getting knocks on the door from packages and maintenance and i just got this feeling that she thought i was crazy
all this will sound fake but i am legit experiencing these hallucinations i decided we needed to meet on tuesday so we met and we talk
right now i have accepted that i really loved this man otherwise i would not be hurting like this and being capable of love is always a positive right he was my first in so many things the first man i told i loved the first man i was intimate with the first man i woke up and slept in his bed the first man to see me without makeup my longest relationship
i have no siblings to share my traumatic experiences withmy cat died horribly right in front of my eyes this coming march i will be transitioning back to the real world
2 marriage is off the table we can discuss that in the future but right now it is not for us i was listening when you were talking about your dad and carolina i was just excited about the thought and though you were as well
made it only worse i am a wreck now and have no idea if it ever gets better the mouth makes me the saddest next to my dead eyes
i have done this before hurt people until they want to die i feel like i have to punish myself for what i have done
i feel like i am becoming stuck to a course or career that i do not want and i want nothing more than just to get out from it
i had a really fucked up childhood and an even crazier run in with drugsdepression and panic attacksthings do not just go away
i would be messed up for hours maybe its what heroin feels like after she left of course i got super depressed as usual
my boyfriend of 5 years dumped me three weeks ago now i was obviously absolutely devastated at a loss mourning sobbing every 1015 minutes up until three days ago that is
this is because we have set up our minds to fight against us we have created a declaration of war to our negative mind
and it makes me sad that i am missing out on all this wonderfulness will i ever get to know someone and their stories maybe then i would not feel so alone
the movie really hits home with me because i am constantly struggling to find a reason to live in the movie the guy has a wife kids and friends who love him i do not have any of those things i have watched this movie the past two or three years and it always makes me cry because i do not have anyone nobody who cares if i live or die
anyway the sadness that i am feeling at this very moment is most likely due to me realizing that again but what initiated that realization was something that i did not know it would make me react like this
they in the meantime started spending a lot of time by my uncle and his neighbor who is this nice guy that everyone is pretty sure is gay
i do not know what is the right way to end this but i will do iti am going to leave everything for my own sake
i always had a tiny bit of hope that maybe i will get to her and then apologize to her singing her favorite song while wearing her favorite shirt
i have only been away from school for two days and someone told me they miss me i have barely been this happy before
i am having a hard time feeling i have anything of value to bring to the table not with her or anybody
the illogical sadness is giving me so much discomfort i can not bear it anymore i have attempted to end myself a couple of times before but failed
i moved to start the job and be closer to him because he was there for me at a low point
5 hours at a time i am hoping that gets better in the next few days because i am really running on empty
i am not sure what is wrong with me it is so easy to be like let us get distracted let us just go out
thought i would post to just vent so i am a natural introvert and have had massively intense social anxiety my entire life
i would do anything to go back and treat him the way he deserved instead of giving him empty promises lies and inconvenience
i have had alot of great things happening to me lately i have recently got a loving girlfriend who i have been friends with for several years
it has hurt me a lot both times but i will be ok i have been through a lot in my life as you know and i am going to get through time
so i told him that i understand and i will give back his key via post then he suddenly changed his mind
i do not know about any of you reading this but i do not know if i would be able to talk so openly in person
now i am at the lowest point i have ever reached and i just want everything to end and speed up to earlier this year
update i called the cops and they called him and he denied taking them so back to square one in having to put further financial burden to get those again
there were 2 managers in particular who talked down to me and treated me like garbage our volume was insane and all the covid19 precautions just made everything that much harder
i am afraid that i am going to be alone for the rest of my life but the depression also takes over when i have the opportunity to go out and do something
i am someone who has always done everything traditionally right i started working young and worked hard i bought my own car with out finance then bought a house at 20 and almost have it paid off after couple years i have only ever slept with one person which is him i cook i clean wash his clothes i have supported him though emotional and financial struggles
but i am really really confused if i really like her and how can i talk about my inside problems with her without messing everything up
i just need some tips if anyone has some on how to get over her faster i will find someone like that again do not you think at least i hope i do
today will be the 17th night i spend sobbing still doing all of my tasks playing games everything while i sob
even if i wanted to die i do not think they would still accept a 14 yo girl that just killed herself in to heaven
the problem is that she acts entirely different when we are together than when we are chattingshe is completely ghosting me from messages while together we have fun and she seems interested
yeah you did it most of the time but i regret it because that would showed me the same things but in the way you really are your coldness inside with a different attitude that would lift the red flags so clear to me
she sat there like a zombie no emotion on her face and i immediatly understood she had become numb from the shock so i let her sleep and sat in the backyard to cry since i wanted to be strong for her i did not want to cry in front of her
my most recent ex dumped me on my birthday after taking me out to dinner and has not messaged me once that was 35 months ago and the man has a permanent scar on his left hand about three inches long as a reminder of me
i do not know what to do like i have already tried to convince her to talk to a counselor but she did not
so i will try to keep it short i have social anxiety and a lack of social skills due to the anxiety and lack of experiences all of this lead to me not having any meaningful relationships or friendships with other for 18 years
this was not an attempt this was impulse and curiosity after an argumment with my stepmom i am okay i wish i was white because then life would be so much easier for me
so he recently came to stay a week at my house and it just so happens that the week coincides with the anniversary of his mothers death
that is why this is anonymous plus no one will read it i am pretty normal on the outside only then something matters
our body is reacting in different ways to the pain crying in different unusual occasions shaking like a god damn iceberg is about to fall apart
all my doubts vanished god how much i have missed her i thought i think i stopped being sad a long time ago too close to when she passed away
i feel like i am losing my mind without him he says that he hates me but then he stares at me only making me miss him more i want him back buthehlife sucks am i right
the one gift i thought i had which was to share love and beauty with the world is all drained out from my depression
i lost weight when i got back in the gym from 301 to 280 i have meet a lot of different women by being out no dating apps
i really wanted to make myself a nice dinner but i did not enjoy it that much i usually love to eat by myself and the cookies i bought were not that good either
also i still love him i can not block him i am not seeing him anymore i am only in my parents and talking online now
i had already done so much work to love my body entirely before we got together but now since he left
i see that she is been trying to get my attention on her snapchat story by posting inside jokes that were just between us two her out with friends and even copying something that i used to do on my story it was like my own thing
sometimes i envision myself completely alone pill bottle in my hand watching the world fadesometimes i envision myself in a nice dress makeup done for me lying in a cold dark box
we had an amazing summer together we returned back home together and i asked you about us they already have friends so they usually act like they do not need more
i delayed breaking up with him for 1 year because he was my best friend and i did not want to imagine a world without him
does anyone have any suggestions for him or for me to deal with thisas far back as i can remember i have had this feeling
i feel like i have lost every single argument because i always feel they have made solid points and i can not respond adequately
however she started not coming to school i tried but could never find the reasons i got pregnant with my pedo stepdads kid i caught covid19
who is going to stop me who wants to hurt me next we all know the right way so why is the wrong one so crowded
but at this point am i better off or is just better for any woman even her that i except the reality of dragging down the love of my life or the life of a stranger
since then twice when she is gone over to hang with this group she is ended up going back to another house with the same 2 guys ot guy inc
my mom got me to do this after all those events this fall then she told my whole family about it
i am feeling very down i do not even know who i am anymore too much negativity at home and in life itself i have 1 friend and that is it
you gave me the choice to be friends with you but i do not think it would be the best idea for either of us
however last night at 2am she posted a picture of her new cat on a bed nothing wrong with that but the other half of the picture was someone is legs and they were not hers now there is 2 possible scenarios
i hope one day i can be happy again i also wanted to talk to teachers or parent but i never get the chance i know i never work as hard as the best student but i just never felt joy in school
when he was down he would talk to me and we would talk things out and i would help him in any way i could he was not on any medication and i know it was hard for him but he kept pushing through no matter what and never gave up and that made me really proud to see that effort and bravery
it has never been more important for all of us to come to a collective understanding of exactly what addiction is what is is not how it happens how we free ourselves from it and how we can avoid it in the future or use it to our advantage
i have tried so much in real life and it never works out for me i also get a sense of people feeling sorry for me and it is the worst feeling
my friend is a queer trans bipoc so one of the most vulnerable groups to police brutality and on top of that they were going through a mental health crisis
i deal with depressive episodes and anxiety anxiety attacks i go to a college out of state and as annoying it may be dealing with some of my parents issues comments i really miss home i get very depressed at college away from family boyfriend and do not have many close friends there
i somehow just managed to finish high school and i have been homebound for 3 years now not working or seeing my friends
when we moved in together it was a bit of a rush due to issues with her parents so we decided that we may not be ready and it would be safest to have our own rooms
now three months later here he is doing great he posts pictures of himself traveling and of course he has a new girl at first i did not really mind because like i said when we were together things were really tough
even if i wake up tomorrow i will probably damage my organs or something or i will vomit it is all so daunting and so foreign to me
idk how to explain this exactly but sometimes i feel like i feel almost an opposite kind of mania one in which i am hyper excited and feel productive to because harm to myself
since i was a kid i always had really a really violent and gory imagination and morbid taste though that is probably normal but that turned to very violent suicidal thoughts when i was around 1415
i do not really know where this message is headed to i just felt to vent and i question myself should not we all have the right to be happy at least sometimes if there is a god why he allow people to be unhappy and feel burden for such a long time i am also beconing kind of hopeless in life i used to be optimistic and think hey tomorrows going to be better but after illuding myself many times i really do not care anymoere
after giving it a lot of thought i recently broke up with my bf of 6 years there is nothing wrong with the relationship and we have been through a lot of tough times together and would always emerge stronger i do love him and i think i always will
what is a reasonable time frame to give yourself post break up before moving on and trying dating apps i think it is time for me to chat to guys and see what is out there i am afraid it will set me back further so have kept to myself until now
but i am beginning to get better at dealing with it maybe i welcome it at timesi usually doodle a lot of my feelings but today seemed especially bad
did i miss something where social distancing also means you can not call or text people back even now that some of the restrictions were removed those people who would talk to me before the pandemic have all but disappeared out of my life
have talked to my boyfriend but they say they are helpless and can not do anything i do not blame them can not force people to like a freak show
i still love him he still loves me we want different futures and i know that is okay but my god does it hurt more than anything
2 regarding your social circle what would you wish for more than anything else thanks so much in advance looking forward to reading your answers
this is so toxic and my relationship was not like this and my ex friend is just completely insane i quit smoking 2 months ago i almost always work out but i still have this emptiness inside me
there is too much stress for me i feel selfish though because my life does not seem at all bad from the outside
i can not seem to actually erase him bc we have a lot of mutual friends so i have kind of been keeping to myself
i try to make all of them happy but fail miserably which make me feel way more useless than i already do which no one does
like i got all as after sacrificing my mental health yet i feel like shit still i am not proud of myself
that said i also want everything else that comes together with love all the pain and negative emotions that naturally come with loving someone
to avoid any equity drama he put his name on deed and i bought furniturepaid the absurd hoaalso i did not mean this to be some self promotion just trying to help me and others like us
any thoughts that you are having at this time like i am not beautiful enough i am not strong enough i was not caring enough
my dad passed away jan of 2019 and he was the only person i ever felt loved me and the only family i had
i watched a movie again for the first time since april 2020 in december i actually watched 3 movies so far in december 2020 i kind of just spontaneously watched a movie with my family which is pretty cool
i do not think they even realize how much they mean to me i fear that if i give up they might too
the worst part is i started living with my best friend a few years ago but even tho he is in the room next to me i almost never see himand i feel we both have changed over the years grown apart
i do not have any serious mental health issues but just like everybody else i sometimes found myself wondering and asking what is the point so yeah i had bad days
i can not stand it anymore i have suffered enough i am so tired i am under so much pressure and suffering so much pain i can not do anything right i feel so useless and like such a failure
back in the states i was not the life of the party either and had struggled with loneliness all 22 years of my life at that point so i fell for the grass is greener illusion
i have been single for a really long time now that is 8 years now i tried going on dates but it did not workout
my mom is definitely the controlling type and constantly tells me that i am not measuring up with what i do professionally she has a very fixed idea for the type of jobs she considers to be worthy lawyer doctor and also adheres to a very rigid idea of class structure
he said he still cares about me still wants to talk to me does not want to lose me but he does not want to be together
amazing people who actually are able to reciprocate and understand and even go so far as to tell me that they do not exactly understand but they will try to because i am their friend and they care
i do not know maybe you have some advice especially with the about what to talk part because atleast for me now if i think about it i never really talked honestly with anyone besides my therapist and my best friend and i always get scared that it is just not worth it for a person or shehe reacts weird to an information maybe this comes from the whole traumas my mother gave me as a kid talking with everyone in front of me about personal stuff i did not wanted anyone to hear
even though i can not control them i think i am a bad person but then again i scold myself for acting like a attention seeker and manipulator
then he said that he thought i was too sensitiveemotional about the things he said sometimes and he can not deal with that
i can vaguely remember what i felt like before things were this bad but i do not remember what it feels like to feel in control of my mind
being single has it is perks but if you do not have any physical contact with anyone for a while it reeks havoc on your life
because no one hits me up it is weird seeing anyone text me at all i will read the message and i think oh did they just text the wrong person then i will wait a bit to see if they send another text saying sorry wrong person so far that is not the case
but i did and actually i never though i would say that but it feels kind of good to be alone now
my close friends have severe depression and i do not want them to have to go through a death i have my mind set though and i guess this is just me voicing my regrets and feeling selfish
i feel so happy with my status in life except this constant feeling of loneliness that is eating my personality and happiness up
and i just fucking hope we were right about thatit is been 2 years since i have been in a relationship and i am deeply in love with her
i later learned that sometimes extroverts just adopt people and she happened to be relatively popular so i had an instant new friend group
i just wish you would is knowledge that you received what i sent you or what you did you got something some kind of acknowledgement like f you or f off or something i do not care just give me some kind of acknowledgement please
i just return to the same depression again it keeps hurting me over and over again i have even began getting sick of my emotions as well

she calmed herself and asked me to talk to her when i get such thoughts or urges again only if she knew

i have lived with my parents since i was born because of muscular dystrophy which made me stop walking since i was 4
all while my mum indicated me what i had to write down not to mention how i kept making mistakes and writing stuff where it did not belong making me more stressed out
how did i end up being like this it is strange because i think i do not feel this is the life i should have
work resigned all of these had happened since i started taking medications they have been mentioning a hamster funeral they want to hold with readings
we have only been broken up maybe a month and she seems like she is moved on already and i am dying inside i am completely destroyed this person i thought i was going to spend my life with who i thought felt the same as me could just walk away after everything we have been through together
to put it simply i knew the events that happened they are hard to stomach for most people to fathom but for me it was something that did not affect our relationship it did not make me run away i made the choice to stay
then she blocks me againit sounds dramatic but these thoughts have been getting me worked up for a while now advice reassurance
so what is the point of life if i am always scared i do not think there is one all i will do is suffer and ruin everything around me
the punishment that i fear is being transformed to something ugly but being unable to see it i do not want to say a lot of details about it
there are more factors and it is not like it does not make sense it is not a riddle that makes no sense it is just a riddle i am struggling so fucking hard with and that i have failed to solve for all this time that is some time 29 years that is a lot of years
this time of year is worse because being away from my family is painful but i think it would be probably painful as well if we were together
me and my family was about to go somewhere today so i saw this as my chance to be a stubborn brat and do everything i can in my power so they will go without me leaving me alone to get money and buy sodium nitrite and all the important drugs to od on
it is useless to sit there and be sad or cry for something that can not really be fixed at all at this point anyway
i am a very introverted anxious and awkward person in social situations so i have cut myself off from groups and distanced myself from everyone i go to college with which is why i feel so lonely and have no one to talk to other than these guys that have a thing for me and are constantly trying to pursue something which i end up going along with as i have no one else to talk to and i do not want them to loose interest and not want to even be friends because i am not an interesting person besides the looks
when exams came i wrote them really badly during exam i could not get my thoughts and ideas together and write the exam

it has not gotten easier i guess i do not understand how someone could say they love forever and then hurt you this way

have you ever felt alone enough to approach the heater pipe and ask if anyone is there well i approached the heater pipe and asked if anyone is in that pipe i know that sounds crazy and maybe little schizophrenic maybe i need a girl friend but i am so afraid to living relationship with a girl omg what should i do
i was 9 and i forgot what i had gotten in trouble for but my mom had slammed my head on a tile ground so hard i had an egg bruise on my forehead
i desperately tried in hopes he would change his mind but it was not working well fastforward to yesterday and it finally exploded
i was 17f at the time it happened about a year and a half ago she had some trouble i will not go into it that much i do not really understand why she never contacted me after that and i am very sad and confused about it and i feel like i can get best answers here
they all asked that lol and i honestly have no idea everyone asks me what they can do to support and help and i have got absolutely no clue
i am so tired of waking up everyday and pretending like shit is going to changefor a long time i could not make that decision
i hate that i can not figure out what to do to help her i just want to help her and i can not
with our flaws we do not really get to try to understand them we try to hide them and put them away
the first she came back to me she also told me it was mainly because all the other guys sexualized her so much while i was with her for her and that was true yet i hate that i fear her giving her body to someone else
i know that not alot of people will care about what i am about to say but i know that ill feel better by saying the things that are on my mind
both of them had me do several written tests and took tons of notes but i was never offered any answers or any form of diagnosis
i found myself desperately begging for him to accept my love i was smothering him because he was so unbothered by how much i had
but we do have our lovey moments he will be really sweet sometimes and say nice things to me and ask me to sleep on the phone with him and talk to me for hours about everything under the sun
i was the one who ended it he does want me back i do want to try again with him but i am not ready i do not feel ready some days i want him and other days i get so angryscared with the thought of things being the same that it makes me sick
ever since then i have been utterly lonely i have not gone outdespite current situations in so long at least that is some kind of explanation of how i deal with things
i explained my situation to give him more context telling him how much i loved him you have refused to forgive yourself
i not in my mind picturing the false reality i wish i wanted instead i feel alive living a day that does not make me feel lonely
i never thought we would be one of those stories and here we areas time went on it was like a normal romantic relationship between two people
i am autistic i am an alien no doubt about it no one cares enough to understand who i am really and when i have a meltdown cry or whatever people act weird people are going to get tired of the shit i go through
i see it for what it is now it is overwhelming and peaceful at the same time to realize that llife will go on after i end the same as it went on before i began
i just do not know what to do anymorei will be actively helping the people at my university emotional development and fostering a more inclusive conversation
i can not tell if these nightmares are because of a past trauma or if it is my brain telling me that something is going on and i am missing it
my dad tortures me with my fucking allergies and is only ever happy with me if i do good religiously or academically
i have been depressed all my life i think i was around 8 when i first said that i wanted to die and i am 14 now and still want to just kill myself i have tried loads of different therapies and i am on anti depressants and recently anti psychotics all the pills i have been given are not working they just make me feel not like myself and they make me feel mildly panicked all the time
4 fucking months 4 god damn months and nobody thought to tell me i knew and understood that we had grown apart but fuck man i figured someone would have told me and that i would not have to find out on fb on my prom night
then my ex shows up we have been trying to stay cool with each other so we just chatted a bit and played beer pong for a while
also this the first relationship for both us and first everything elses and we dated for 9 monthswaking up and starting day 4 of no contact with you
fast forward we became official after 4 months of dating despite our busy work schedule our relationship felt fullfilling that it made me feel this is it
sadly i accepted this and was resolute in my desire to leave her be the very next morning she called me crying and begging for me back
and i am already done after 2 gifts gloves and a wireless charger no matter how deep i cut it did not bleed i do not understand why it did not work
most of the time being a functional alcoholic he never really bothered anybody however the in the past two years he is been really annoying
now in this case the supportive people around me would help me feel better and maybe hang out with me but my family would say something like stop pouting you are just making everyone else feel worse
we would talk in these periods and it would be nice but eventually i would have to reinforce nocontact because being it was making me feel guilty that i could not be who he wanted me to be
just like many of you i have always struggled with depression and extreme feelings of loneliness over the years but with the lockdown things got even worse as i see almost no body
a little kid being forced to sit in a mans lap a little kid who had to call an ambulance for my own mother
that said i get extremely sexually frustrated sometimes which i fix with hookups if i can we are talking like once or twice a year obviously the guys i have been with want nothing but sex i would ask them for a little caress and they may or may not give it but the next thing is they want to f me again
i fucking hate everything what if there is a fire what if i am ill what if something bad happens i feel constantly anxious
he wants me to move on and be happy and love myself but he was the one who taught me how to love myself
my life on the other hand has always been dark i have social phobias and do not have friends because i am scared of people
i just find myself curious if he is talking to her doing the things that him and i used to do if he even thinks of me for a little
i got no response then after a few days i messaged her that it is okay that i will move on and forget her i told her that i would miss her down the road but i will get over it
i thought at first maybe i needed some time to my self to understand what i am going through and why i am feeling the way i am
i have not been the best person as of lately either so i feel a lot of guilt christmas today just kind of reminds me of everything i have lost
he had a lot going on but i do not think i will ever heal i feel so stupid now that i think about this
i believe what every diet tells me and how i see it all food is poison i keep a note on my phone reminding me of that hoping it will inspire me to skip meals
i am writing this from a good place and it feels so foreign to me i had a good day and i was in a good mood
i thought we were going to get married instagram had a big effect on our relationshipi do not know how much i can take it anymore
no one how much he wants me back and wishes he could forgive mei was feeling all alone as i did not know anyonehe helped me out when i needed the most
i have a therapist who i have been seeing for a long time and is really helpful however our work has been at its most successful when focusing on letting go of romantic feelings entirely and being comfortable with the idea that i may well be single forever this is something that i am increasingly becoming more comfortable with but it is hard when i hear these conversations with friends that contest that entire worldview
i am in my late 20s and i have been single for the majority of my life i have only had one girlfriend when i was in my early teens that is it and it was not for that long either then i fell in love with someone later on in my teens who i thought i had a really good shot with but someone else got to her before i did and i missed my chance
does anyone know what the best way is to donate your organs are not just dead or not dead quite yet organs best when someone needs a transplant i would think maybe like taking your life inside a hospital might be best unless they try to bring you back which would be a huge nope
i thought i would be more level headed in a suicide related crisis but i full on panicked last night i have tried to end my life multiple times i grew up as a young carer for my mum who has struggled with mental health since before i was born but i panicked when my friend was in a crisis
on the outside to others i may seem fine right now but little do people know my time is soon to expire
2 weeks after that she calls me and asked me if i missed her but i did not answer that because i did not know what her intentions were so i just ended the call a day after she tells me that her intention was to fix things up so when i agreed to do it she then took a step back and said that she was confused
i wanted to wright this because when i feel like this i sometimes do not tell anyone and suffer alone and sometimes i tell everyone and get upset that i did that
it is hard for me to talk about the mental health professionals or schools maltreatment of me also because it is hard to find people to relate to
you think of breaking the glass because you got so many angry and sad feeling inside you that you want to smash something just like you heart was smashed by the biggest hit and went down a million piece on the ground
i also wanted to improve myself i have friends at school but i just do not feel happy i would cry everyday and i never felt joy outside of the internet i think i might be addicted but i am not really at the same time
i woudlnt wish that pain on anyone even my worst enemies if i had any besides myself i was perscirbed painkillers for the pain and
but things did not go well at break up and i have gone back and forth with pressuring her to get back with me
i did not give in to it and called her out on her behavior i am trying i swear please do not tell me to try harder
i have this feeling all the time maybe it is loneliness maybe emptiness i do not think a partner can make it better i do not think anything can
i have nothing no one left to keep fighting to live anymore i am not the praying type but i prayed for my partner to come back
i do not believe it is stress related as i am not a very stressed person and i do exercise as often as i can i feel it may be diet specifically too much sugar i do not exactly eat the healthiest which i am sure is a contributing factor i know i need to quit but with time and all being an issue sometimes it can get hard
but i am still quite unsure since i am not even at the age where i am mature enough to comprehend and analyze peoples mental health
my room looks like it was hit by a tornado and i am sleeping on my futon and there is trash and laundry piling up
people on tiktok even begin to fake dissociative identity disorder multiple personalitys for likes which totally distorts the image of this disorder and the same goes for every other one like depression
if it gets that far then i experience almost visual hallucinations like the room getting very small and i am massive or my arms are stretching and are now 10 feet long or my legs are tiny and actually 2 inches long or the walls are moving or there are flashing lights everywhere or my hands are moving by themselves and i can not control them
my thinking ability is very low i can not go deep with topics subjectsdiscussion also the emotional part destroyed me i think with my heart rather than my brain
what are peoples views on healthcare professionals with their own mental health problems i am a final year nursing student who has worked in healthcare for manny years and i have experienced a long history of mental health care problems myself and do have obvious self harm scars on my harms but these are healed and any other injuries are fully covered
i have considered that i may be asexual or aromantic but i do not want to be i want to be in a relationship but 90 of the girls i know hate me as it is i call people out on their bullshit i do not understand emotional and thought based actions i am cold closed and afraid to rely on people i hate drama and emotional baggage
this started a couple months ago but now it is very dangerous and extremei have two friends in this situation i will name one a and one b
you want to talk to people but feel like your existence is a burden for everyone else you want to kill yourself just to make your family know you should have taken me seriously
the loneliness got to me and i was depressed so i ended up moving schools now my next school was interesting
i do not want to die but another part of me does because of my health and being a burden on everyone
i went on a solo trip in the 2nd month after the breakup he reached out to me after a month and a half of the breakup and i shut him down politely and did not show interest while talking to him so he never contacted me again yeah he has not reaching out wanting me back or saying he misses me or anything at at at all and i am kind of glad
i used to be able to read a book for hours and now i am lucky if i can focus my attention on an online article
the thing that drives me mad is that it was good we were magical together and it did not make sense that it ended like this
a few months ago my niece was born she is now the joy of the family and rightfully so my sister and my brotherinlaw have their heads in the clouds and my father and mother are happy like they have not been in a long while
i sort of just want to lock myself away and not speak to anyone but i think that would make me more sad
but but like i said i do not have a girlfriend omg i will die alone anyway people assume time absolute progression of because to come to a conclusion
i do not know if i am just lonely or depressed at this point i feel like i know how to be happy but i have done things alone and kept a lot of things to myself
one night i made a deep cut into my thigh it would not stop bleeding so my mom took me to the hospital
when i was young 13 i felt really sad and anxious all the time i was wondering can you be too young to be depressed
my little sister is my only reason to live always has been i am too cowardly to leave her behind it would crush me
however 3 days before my birthday we were put under lock down and could not really go out so not much was special about it i also had planed another get together with friends to celebrate after christmas but one of my friends family got covid and it is cancelled on top of this i am constantly counting days and stressing about going back to school
she would go blank when she would get mad but five rocky years of falling second to his addictive personality
i told him that it is wrong of her to just ask to hang out with him after he made it clear that their thing is over but all he did was get angry at me and tell me that she is just tone deaf but does not mean any harm by it
note i am not here by any means to diminish other peoples experiences and repercussions of the pandemic many have been made affected in all sorts of ways overworking unemployment mental health issues loneliness loss of loved ones and so on even i was affected by this from an indirect manner
but honestly i could not do it because i felt trapped and in a horrible dark hole that i never go out
my parents do not know i have to be strong because we have been in a very bad economic situation and i have had to be the man of the house my younger brother tries very hard he is working very hard on a sports project where he has to be concentrated and training seven days a week and he has me as his anchor so i always have to be strong for him
so today when i heared what happened i was not shocked it was something that seemed to me like you could expect and still it is insanely awkward and strange to know that person you knew no longer exists
soyeah that was a lot can anyone offer some avenues to pursue to get myself in a healthier headspacei am running out of meds and i do not have a psychiatrist i recently moved to another state
hi all i have been lurking in this group on and off for a while but it is my first time posting i am a journalist working on a story about chronic loneliness something i have personally experienced for most of my life
i have not gotten into a school and i do not have a proper job and i do not have friends to hang out with
i recognize that i am very mentally ill but of course getting help has been made difficult too i am desperate for anything to end this psychological torture
i am pretty disgusted with myself that i let it come this far he even talked me into having unprotected sex which i never have since i usually do not have sex at all afterwards he did not remember anything
said some horrendous things about me like i should die she regrets dating me i am a liar and all i showed to her when we regained contact was just an act for my own satisfaction
you ask me all the time if i would ever attempt again everytime i tell you no i can not even begin to tell you the amount of times in a day i still consider it though i do not even trust myself to be alone anymore i am trying
the i it stresses me out alot because i overthink sometimes and have this cognitive junk food of always feeling lonely
i cannot just forget about it when it feels like the marks is all over mei am nothing but dirty no one would love someone like this wholly
within the next couple of hours the emptiness will surround me a growing bitter taste in my mouth please if anyone read this just any comforting words would help so much
i do sincerely apologize for the things i said right after everything that happened last month and i apologize for bringing things up all the time
this is going to sound like a paradox but does anyone have ideas for ways to build up a discomfort tolerance i am gradually realizing just how discomfortaverse i am and i want to become better at working through discomfort without minimizing it
there is still some hurt there from my friends growing distant but i know it is something i can not change and so i need to take control of my life and stop waiting for them to come back but also leave my arms open if they choose to come back
i am very selfishly scared of not being loved again like that i have nothing to stay here for so this is my final goodbye
i smoked some weed and actually i have been smoking a decent amount and i tried watching a gad video and i identified with some parts but not others i used to think i had obsessionsl ocd because i worried if i was gay for awhile then got over it by not caring i have also had violent repetitive thoughts but that was a couple years ago and i can hold a knife without worrying
i do not even know why i am posting these anymore being suicidal has become the norm for me some days it is better some days it is worse today is one of the worse days where i am seriously considering it i i just wish that i had killed myself earlier
either way i rly need someone to talk to i am bored and tired and depressed i know this is embarassing and pathetic but whatever i do not care anymore
he says he does not care about his life anymore just like my father he once told me he is depressed and that if would be better if he died
there is more stuff but it is getting confusing and out of order so i am leaving it at this maybe you spoke with your heart but the way you spoke to me was nonetheless hurtful
i asked to call and he answered but he seemed annoyed by me he told me there is no point in talking nothing good will happen i told him i just wanted some closure he said it is done and we should leave it at that
they fed me and taught me what i know and i hate that my two futures are either live unhappy and working and putting effort into things when you do not want to
but he was my best friend and we both wanted to stay friends now we are at a point where we talk every day
i am not special i am replaceable i am disposable i am just dirt i am trash i am just taking up space i want to rest
i mean i can text them how i am feeling and sometimes i do and they can text back and sympathise or give me advice but usually they do not understand the experience of it
you need to make it objective where you are listening to some feelings or you are reading some feelings because then you realise you are not your feelings
do not know how long ill be gone but i can guarantee no one will ever see me again i hate that we got to move different paths
this is our one shot our only shot to experience these things and as much as i want to believe there is nothing after this life and i am so scared of the nothingness i am selfish i want to experience it all i hope you can be selfish too
i know that i am a dime a dozen dumb uncultured irresponsible and all that shit but i am fucking tired of people lying to my face and saying that i am not
i find my self becoming more and more stereotypically suicidal every day the other day i saw a an instagram post about warning signs and i fit into every one i do not want to be here ideally i want to kill my self at age 27 there is alot more details to it but i keep it in my brain but recently i have found my self caring less and less about when or how and more about just wanting to be gone suicide is so
so much for not wanting a relationship for a while lol do you guys think he will ever talk to me again what should i dowe met 3
now i just see her in memories i dream about her every night so now i hardly sleep i see her in the daily things i do like she is there but is not really
i need to stay strong i can not die now and i need to stay strong is all that was running in my head
i almost never remember medicalmental appointments and always forget to put them in my phone so i can remember about them
my father was terrible with me being little he would call me ugly dumb or locking me up for days starving but i was always told my brother had it worse because he was a boy and he did not have the fatherly figure he was supposed to grow up with turns out that they are really close today i was my mothers support while she was divorcing my father but i was just 8
but it did not workinstead i developed a mental thing called depersonalization and i always feel like i live in a fucking dream and nothing feels real
i wish i did not have to ruin their days with my sad ramblings i can not solve they always say they love me and they want to help and i recognize that
a part from my family who is toxic i have no one i have tried making friends and sure i have friends on instagram
for a while i was her only friend but i stood by her as she began to recognize her worth and made some friends
i know people are taught to have empathy but understand i am really struggling herei have a problem i have never had a relationship before
if someone managed to actually read this i am thankful i would beg you for a job or something but that is futile
popular but still i did alright for myself now i am in my mid 20s and i literally have no one
i broke my arm roller skating today i took an ambulance to the hospital and my daughter did not want to pick me up and give me a ride home she told me it is an inconvenience and that she is busy and she did not want to give me a ride home from the hospital i am in excruciating pain and i have to have surgery and my daughter told me she does not have time to drive me to and from surgery i have no one in this world that cares about me my heart is beyond broken i have spent today sobbing
that you do not look at their social media once in a while that you do not think about them and a flood of sadness clouds you
is there any way to keep this from happening like some sort of documentation i can show that will make hospitals and police question what they have been told instead of blindly disbelieving me
the next time she came over she gave me some paintings the lord of the rings painting and a naruto painting
in the beginning of our relationship i was in a bad space i was depressed and had no supportive family or friends so i became codependent on him
like there is so many things wrong with myself family school friends and there are still lots of things wrong or bad
you were an important person in my life long before we started dating so i lost two people in one and sad to say you are irreplaceable
i know that i will never get myself together i have tried so hard everytime i felt motivated i lost that motivation in a matter of a day
through my art education and writing i hope to be a part of changing this paradise to be less violent tragic and exploited
people are always saying there is good things in life which make it worth living but to be honest if we had never existed then we would not know about said good things so really we would not be missing out on anything at all
boyfriend makes me incredibly uncomfortable she repeatedly forces me to be around him whilst claiming she is just trying to get me used to him so that we can possibly have a relationship in the future
i think it was this moment that i stopped communicating what i was feeling and started talking to other girls for emotional gratification
i cried hard when i thought my lost pet died earlier this year and i cried not as much when he was found but my grandmother died shortly afterwards
my ex has a habit of coming into and out of my life then i graduated college in may and started studying for the lsat for my law school applications
it is been a crazy fun adventure of a life but now that i am set up in scotland for what feels like the longterm i realise how lonely i am
in 2019 i got into a relationship which really boosted my confidence i also grew really close to someone who often came to my house for dinner and movies
the same time that he broke up with me my best friend moved to colorado for a job my other best friend got into a new relationship and is always busy
the other night i heard loud arguing from my window saw a man just a passerby outside arguing with another man who seemed to be standing still in shock and worry
but there were also things and moments i tolerated when honestly i really fucking should not have i know i deserve better than the inconsiderate bullshit you put me through
i do not want to exist i have dreamt of me being ill enough to die and i felt relieved for the first time ever
and this fusion of two identities into one further contributes to a sturdier emotional connection greater love and most notably a newly constructed life meaning
i have done some pretty awful things in the past and engaged in less severe but still modes of conduct that could be perceived as abnormalaberrant
i know i am far from the only person whose life is affected i am only 18 but feel like i am the only one keeping the family together
i knew that her baby already had to do shared visitation with her real father who abandoned her for a good 2 years before he decided to step up and the mom
i am still internalizing my feelings but my body betrays me my hands are breaking out in dyshidrosis i still lose sleep i still feel like there is a dark cloud over me
the love was real it was a deep love to where it makes you think our souls will always be intertwined
we spent two years together i got back to school and told everyone we had never dated i was ashamed of having dated her
throughout the days weeks and months of your recovery you will feel a wide range of emotions all at varying intensities
i was told by everyone i was different and destined to be a rockstar so i never saw the value in working and thus have never held a job for any prolonged period of time
is what i keep telling myself christmas day will be a month since we broke up and it still feels fresh as the day it happened
if anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer some advice that might actually help i do not know if i would ever be able to thank you enough
everything feels different now even though i know it is not that differenti was wondering if this is unhealthy or normal ormods let me know if this is against the rules
and those things hit me even harder it seems two days later a former teacher of mine back home killer himself too
i am happy that i have a medical card and i have this safe source of weed it has helped a lot but i never smoked until now i hope i do not make this a habit forever and it is just something that helps right now
if you want to like or comment go ahead i will have notifications turned off for the night i hope for all of us things get better as soon as possible stay strong until you have someone you can be weak with
i am awake but my brain is dozing off while doing these things then it hits me and that is when the feeling of emptiness creeps in
my sister uses reddit a lot had she is always recommended it to me since it has many communities that want to help others
the past few days she is been posting things on her story about how happy she is and today she posted one say how good she felt today and how today was just such a nice day even though it is two weeks since our breakup
my parents who live 5 minutes away from me would rather let a stranger into their house than see me or spend the holidays with me the guy i was dating does not ask me how i am doing or wish to see me my mother thinks i am a curse and i have absolutely no friends
they help a little but as i mentioned before i keep spiraling downwards at random moments really i was often cold distant and angry
i guess i am looking for some kind of emotional guidance or understanding maybe perspective on why i am feeling thisi miss you i wish you would have taken the time to talk to me
i was the only child and i never understood how could someone hate their sibling my mother is a teacher and my dad is a ceo they met through a friend and had a secret wedding pretty cute right
when i look in the mirror all i see is a piece of trash with no future i can not live with myself continuing to do this to myself and everyone around me
i really had to take strong tranquilizers and antidepressants to cope with it i have really made a huge effort to hold to my new job which envolved high pressure results
oh baby well come over here and let me cuddle you what do you want to do today let us brighten it up for you baby
i used to use gaming as an escape as a place of solace but even that has slowly lost it is meaning for me which to be honest has been kind of hard
we broke up on the back of an argument where she said she feels like i just do not care about her anymore and that she feels like i am just not interested
a week ago she had what i can describe as a psychosis which i knew had happened before with her as she told me some time after we first met
i spent every hour of my day talking to her i loved her with everything i hadthat said when he said this person made him feel so grounded understood it made me feel extremely bad
i have spent the last 35 years with someone i fell in love with on a deep emotional level i was met with empathy love and friendship i have not experienced with anyone i have told them my deepest secrets and unlike others in life was met with kindness and understanding encouragement no judgements a feeling that brought parts of my soul to see life
i used to write little parody news articles when i was 13 people said i could do it professionally imagining a socially inept autistic writing savant
it is been two years since we broke up well i broke up with her as she cheated on me with a taller guy and quite recently a month or two ago i started talking to a girl from back where i moved from
my boyfriend and i just broke up and i am truly devastated a part of me has vanished i feel empty and utterly alone i used to say rawr to him and now i have no one to say it to rawr i love you
if it is feeling like you are not worth it listan to me you are you are gorgeous or handsome and if anyone says other wise their just jealous you are always worth it do not forget about that no matter what happens or who says other wise everyone is different and that makes you unique and unique is amazing
since july i started having intrusive thoughts the first few months were just paranoid thoughts but then it evolved into harm and sexual thoughts
i spent the next two weeks stressing over everything feeling like every moment was going to last and there was not anything i could do about it but at the time i was embracing the feeling wanting it to happen
i do not want to exist anymore and i do not want to wake up in the morning anyway this morning i packed my things and left
idk if any of you guys could help me that would be great and i would really appreciate it how do you go about managing something that might upset you or make you angry
i just feel like shit because we were so close to meeting only 3 months awaydo you ever wonder what would happen if you never got dumped
you know what you are doing but you are not fully there i am barely aware but i am aware enough to do what i need to be independent
i also read a lot and like to do solidarity activities overall it is not that i do not have friends but my friendships are what you might call
but i am unable to get therapy due to circumstances in my private life and i would like to know how to explain it when i am able to see a therapist
we live under the same roof as i live with his family due to circumstances and i am unable to move elsewhere so that is not an option right now
my co workers are all 20 something white women who live 90 min away from me so spending time with co workers is not much of an option
i am having such a hard time accepting it is over we are supposed to have a conversation and there is so much things i would like to tell her i have made major changes since the breakup i have been sober for 12 weeks i was a stoner and she did not even smoke once i exercise i meditate i sold my gaming computer
i do not want to be like this i do not understand why i am so upset for no reason at least a few times a week i just cry in my room for hours for no reason i just feel like i need to even if i have the happiest day ever
5 my thinking process lacks clarity and i do not know what to do i am confused 99 percent of time about my own surroundings
i am a smart guy and i can solve a lot of problems in other areas and people at work always come to me for solutions and i am great with software
but again as time went on and i had not heard from him the feelings went away after all the effort it is my fault things are this way
i just have no idea why i feel so emotionally attached towards this specific person christy mack i just can not get over how much i feel for her i actually spent like over 23 hours if not longer trying to find any information about how she is doing today i followed her on every socialmedia platform i could find just to see how she is doing
and now i am nearing 30 and it is almost impossible to meet someone i actually like because even though i could find a relationship it would not be with anyone decent
i probably sound crazy then again i am using reddit as my advice outlet instead of a therapist oh welli am so lost and could use some words of encouragement
he then basically said what about your gay friend idc if he is gay he is still a man but you met with him anyway even though i was uncomfortable blablabla wtf we literally talked about that months ago and he came the conclusion that he needed to be more understanding that he is a gay man and that he is my friend
yeah it was mutual but what about all of the stuff we planned to do together getting eachother christmas presents spending thanksgiving together having a picnic in the park and looking at all of the christmas lights i can not look at happy couples right now
my preexisting mental disorders are naturally acting up due to loneliness and alcohol abuse causing me to have strange intrusive thoughts paranoia depression and anxiety
these things will never happen that is the truth i have no hope for the future unless i am lying to myself this is not a life worth living i laugh at things and make jokes to help myself cope i do not have to deal with anything serious when i do that when i do deal with serious things i get like i am now weepy and depressed
hopefully i can hold on to that bit of common sense i have in me to just wait until she is in a better mental state
nonetheless she agreed and they ended things but remained friends but every day i mention how i feel to them i just
at age 16 i slashed my arms i can not feel anything i just wanted to die but i survived i thought i will die but i did not it was rather disappointing at this point i have no sight of any reason that makes it worthy enough to warrant myself another chance in life
i grew up with a difficult single parent mother who continues to present mental health problems for me i have touches of anxiety and depression
i am with my family but i feel so distant and like i could burst into tears at any moment i sort of just want to lock myself away and not speak to anyone
when i was adolescent i did not have any friend who i could share with it when i was at the university i was alone the mostly part of my time
i fucking hate everything and now to make matters worse i met a girl who i am in love with and makes things hurt a little bit less and i have too soft a dick too have sex with her
but i am stressed to the point i feel like i am on the verge of a breakdown every 30 minutes and the thing is i should not be stressed
anyways i am not even making sense anymore i wish anyone reading this the best in life as i got about a week i wanted to make it to 2021 and at 1201am on jan 1st i plan to just do it i acquired the drugs to do so and i am going to go by pills in a hotel room i booked for nye
how am i supposed to go back to normal when so many people were just taken out of my life so suddenly
even though i am unemployed i set an alarm to wake up early workout and hop right on my laptop to apply to jobs
i asked if he lost feelings for me and he said he did not want to answer and i said please i just want you to say you did and he said that he did and i asked when and he said after the recent fight he realised i would not change and things will not be fixed
i feel like i can not really talk to anyone about this because no one really cares every time i think about dying i feel a bit better and i feel like it is just fucking time
i broke up with my bf almost 6 months ago and it is been more than a year since i met him but i still cry at night sometimes
fuckin christmas family funwaitin for everyone to go to bed so i can get some reliefdrink n cut my nightmare into sleeponly to do it againnew years is looking gooda 150 rock3 xanny n tonne of weedeveryones goin outi am chillin this yearjust got to get some sleep sick of the rushjust remembersmile to shut everyone upare you ok nah fuk off i love you all but this is beyond the pale of a sadistic joke
i thought maybe this time i will succeed but no i was naive i do not know how could i think about such a thing
i am confused and am looking for some additional perspective on maybe what is going on and what it is that i should do moving forward
i have had a few panic attacks which are awful can not breathe shaking and i have been sick everyday for the last month
after that my body just started shaking uncontrollably for a little bit i attempted to strangle myself again but hated that vibration that i was feeling so i stopped
i never belonged anywhere i was the add on to the group of friends a group i never really belonged to
is everyone really this shitty why do people only care about themselves why am i so forgettable when i put an effort in yet others have people clamouring over them
i need to think about other room move things in my room same time i am defending vs an invisible creature by my fingers and other stuff at same time i am using mirrors and ohher things to look where i can not lok with my eyes and other and other
he did it but he also actually gave her gift advice and told her that i am not cool with them being in contact rather than just telling her to not contact him again
my parents are divorced and i just recently started seeing my dad again due to the stay at home orders where i live
however what is reinforcing my thoughts is my recent termination i allowed myself to get overzealous shove a coworker that had been baiting me all day despite the fact that he was provoking me i should have exercised impulse control i failed to do so was fired on christmas eve i was with this job for a year and a half
i do not want to go inpatient either because my parents have paid a lot of money for the sport i play and if i am hospitalized they will be wasting money
lately however i just feel lonely and disconnected my problem is i feel like something is deeply wrong with me that i will never fix
i was in a long distance relationship that ended last summer sadly and it was the first real one with a person i genuinely loved and even though i have gotten over it and accepted it is over i just get random bursts of sadness from time to time it does not happen at a particular time just randomly
short answer connecting with new people who genuinely share your values and your sense of reality serendiphttpsserendipco helps you do that
i have borderline personality disorder and recently my mother got diagnosed with bowel cancer and it is completely shaken me to the core i can not sleep or eat without throwing up i am drinking every day and to make matters worse i cheated on my partner of three years because i feel so empty and alone that i wanted to feel something i am the worst person alive and i do not will not to be here anymore
but she curses me out because she was so stupid to start a relationship with me while being much older and having different expectations of it
3 what steps are you taking to cope with or to move through those feelingswould get angry if i was not ready at the door before him to go out
this one is from rumi where he said that the wound is the place where the light enters you exactly in the same was as the japanese art of repairing pottery the wound is actually where the light enters you it is what allows you to become a better more wholesome more powerful more incredible amazing individual so do not forget that the wound is the place where the light enters you as rumi said it best
i do not get why i am in my family i just do not get it it is probably convenient when you have depersonalization
however recently she flaked on our plans after sounding really excited and just made a tweet saying who wants to hold hands with me
how do you go about resisting the urge to reach out to that toxic ex it is only been 2 weeks and i am having withdrawals
i asked for courage and god gave me dangers to overcome i asked for patience god placed me in situations where i was forced to wait
in the past years i had two very close friends and i felt connected but about a year ago things changed
we made eachother happy for a time but incompatibility eventually won out and he ended things because he could see that it was destroying our relationship
i can not help but feel like it is all my fault i feel like i did not try hard enough or show them what they meant to me
today my depression is at his worse i am full of insecurities hate myself and sometimes just want to die when someone so close to you stabs you in the back it hits different
i feel like i am unhinged and need to be careful with myself my aunt has bipolar disorder so it sort of runs in the family but not a strong correlation
this state i am in seem to take away opportunities that would usually present themselves not just people because i just feel different weird
exmuslim girl indie rock cooking healthy lifestyle fitness beauty depression reading struggle traditionalist in infinite process of understanding life and trying to enjoy it
it is been 4 days now since the breakup and i have kept myself occupied been going to the gym watching tv shows and reading
yes i do admit that the pandemic has not been easy and perhaps i am being biased here because i have been dealing with these complicated and damn right exhausting issues for quite a while now so i got used to it i know that it sucks a lot but i got used to it in some way
i think he is a good person but he is not someone i could have seen a future with i feel like this relationship has taught me so much
thank you for your time reading this i hope it can help if you are in my situation endure and survive
overall progress trajectory very uncertain the relationships thing appears like an enormously hardtoapproach struggle that is very tricky and elusive for me to resolve
the only person who could help get me out of this and into help is my father hes been told to i should get checked for mental illness but he chalks it up to violent video games or whatever excuse he can find
i feel physically sick even just thinking about him talking to another girl like he talks to me we had an instant connection and things felt so easy with her
he began calling me at odd hours during the week and not to say he is normally not a good conversationalist over the phone but he was being more animated than usual
but as we got more into december i could notice her losing interest in our conversations and wanting to engage less with me
no it was not bullying i went through at least not in the traditional sense it is more so that other people never really seem to want anything to do with me they avoid interacting with me whenever they are not forced to and i in turn do the same every time i have tried to show kindness to others or to make friends with them it just did not work
these days i get this once in a while without cbd use one day i am sitting in front of my computer at work i feel generally calmdisinterested
i am more than this i am stronger than this i am life i am worth it i choose my own path and walk it proudly without looking back
for the past few months i would been feeling the anxiety building been single for about a year and have always been super insecure about myself not having a girlfriend
anyways thanks for reading this if you did thanks for letting me vent i would appreciate any comments suggestions relatable or not stories generally any feedback is welcome i feel a little bit better now at least i got to tell someone
i can not do this shit anymore everyday feels the same and nothing is good anymore everything that was good is gone my mom recently passed i have not been taking care of myself medically type 1 diabetes my family has been pretty much destroyed i moved two states away from everyone that i cared about and now i feel truly alone
i feel as if the moment i relax myself even a little or let my guard down the slightest or feel the smallest bit of happiness something happens to put me back in my place which is at the bottom or well my mind takes me there
i am very emotional and it shows sometimes is part of my personality no where to go no where to go back to
sure i have regrets and good memories but most seem like distant memories or brief moments i feel almost no pain
i tried to encourage him a little after he felt resolved himself but it feels disingenuous especially with what i had said before and that is where the conversation sort of fell
only recently my therapists and i have been passing it off as anxiety but it is way more than that and much harder to explain i am turning to the internet again to see if anyone might have any idea or any suggestions of what i could possibly do to get help
i do not agree with that at all and i am attracted to him but i wonder if they see something i do not
i am not joking when i say every single friendship i have had they have just left i do not feel like my relationships with ppl will ever be healthy and i am sick and tired of it
the problems are usually how it is too difficult to have a conversation with her not allowed to call video chat with her because she has strict parents
her friends were frustrated that i ruined it i was shaking and horrified and packed my things and waited for her to come back
i just want to talk to people i consider my friends i know people get busy i know i am not a top priority just would be nice to talk once in a while i thought that is what friends do maybe i have got this whole friendship idea wrong
my family have said that i have been a fighter since i was born 3 months premature more visits to the er growing up than i can count no real friends two failed marriages due to my spouse cheating 3 heart surgeries and last year a stroke half dozen seizures hit at 37
she was also depressed during the relationship after one of our first big fights she locked herself in a room and cut herself
we have a daughter who we share 5050 custody with one week with him and the next with me and so on
i get anxious about time i feel all the time like i am wasting it even when it is time for me time for work time for sleep time to mourn myself it is all time wasted
this year we are experiencing this pandemic and quarantine still it is cloudy and gloomy outside which is my least favorite kind of weather
so me and my gf of 7 years broke up about 2 months ago and doing no contact and i am really thinking about not telling her anything for her birthday but a part me feels bad is it a good idea to text her happy birthday i know she will be expecting a text from me
i feel like no one actually knows who i am and it is so painful i am so scared of vulnerability and feeling exposed but this feeling of emptiness is killing me
we honestly do not even have that much in common she gave my a halfassed apology sorry i did not mean for it to happen like this but it did
i put on facades and fabricated parts of my personality i had friendships but none of them really lastedi also form unrealistic bonds with people far to quickly
i think it would be more feasable to kill myself with a hydrogen generation system it might be cheaper and take less work but i am not sure i do not want to mess up and i do not have any privacy at home so maybe once corona ends and both my parents are at work idk i am so bad at life i do not think i can kill myself properly
i was having suicidal thoughs and almost acted on them when i was in the 11th grade but stopped feeling suicidal in the 12th grade however i think i might become that again if i do not go to therapy i wish to live does that mean i am depressed i do not feel sad or numb just tired and stressed
he told that they made this and this food and had nice games and very fun night then i saw from his face that he realised that i was exworker of this group too
something would happen to me on a personal level and my first thought is not just a passing whimsical feeling of ugh i want to just die but rather a serious reflection and regret as to why i am still alive
idk its a plan or something i need to def myselfand we playing much harder gamelike testing how i can pvp vs 23 of same things like him
my head pains like shit i can not sleep due to stress i have stayed awake for almost two days without any sleep my father nags at me like anything
now i am being driven crazy with dreams about you every night and can not stop thinking about you everyday i just want it all to stop i wish we never dated
i just want to be a new person start over with a better life with no worries about what will happen next or what i want to do to myself
i know that if he cared he would be more patient with me and it just sucks that after 3 years he was able to leave me so quickly and not look back
i just do not get it why do people be so fake and use someone like this i am just absolutely restless and i do not know what to do
i wish you the best of luck on everything in life and i hope you accomplish everything you want in life
also i am happy with just being friends bc i realize we would not have worked anyway but what is with the cold followups and the blow off text if she did not want to be friends or want to talk why reach out at all is it a apprehensive olive branch
but if i connect with someone usually a girl and they open up to me about their previous escapades or loversi just feel a really deep pit of sadness in me a pit that i do not want to be anywhere near because if i stay in that pit for too long i do not feel like continuing with life
i have a boyfriend he is really good so is his family but he is not from our country so my family does not accept him
i am just lonely the worst part is how sensitive i am i feel like my confidence is taking a hit because i feel like he chose his ex over me
i started to talk with him actually i found its kind of cool and stopped my rageand after some talking i found a veeeeeeeeeeryy trange things
it was honestly one of the most terrifying things i have experienced i panicked and tried my hardest to stop him
maybe that is why i am always making things up why i have been doing so for all my life i have built full persons who feel more real than anyone else and every night i explore more of their lives put them in new situations or just think about why they are who they are sometimes they slip into my mind through the day i love tuning in to see how they are doing
it can be tricky trying to explain the difference but i think the cliche alone in a crowded room is aptmy experience of it is that i relish solitude and mind not at all actual social isolation
i ate breakfast meditated organized my work bag and theni know that a lot of people go through things worse than anything i have ever been through
i know with 100 honesty my mother loves me everyone else loves me when it benefits them then proceeded to tell me that his ex wants face to face closure
i love other people i have empathy and love and delight for so many others that exist but i just can not feel that for me
its not easy but it takes a little switch to afford me me the step away from myself myself from the separation of this mouth biting into the pegedil and that grip angling the beer towards its mouth
i asked her if she had been having sex with her husband behind my back she admitted to me that she was indeed doing so
i am struggling with suicidal toughts and anger issues my sister is a bitch she always has been one she has been bossing me around since i was little
so i used to be close friends with this girl maybe a bit more we also have a lease that ends jan 2022 does anyone have any words of encouragement or advice
if your having a hard time i recommend you read this book over and over again it is called getting passed your break up i never read self help books but this has helped so much
you can even add familial like how much were they connected to your family and how much were you connected to their family
which is not the case here really i am not looking for ways to end everything that is not me he will have sex with any female who will let him
since i was eleven i have had severe anxiety and i have had physical tics neck head eyes for a little over a month
i love her more than i have ever loved anyone and it hurts it hurts that in less than 24 hours she will be out of my life forever it hurts that she is stopped loving me there i go again bawling
after a few weeks of meditation maybe even days you will begin to bring that state of peace and calm to your day to day life and as crazy as that sounds it is true try it
i can not rely on people to hold my hand for my whole life and yet i can not survive any other way
let me start this off by saying i am a 30 year old man who recently got out of prison i did close to 8 years for various drug offenses and violent crimes
he also said people never noticed him in any crowd and that he had no friends but he seemed popular to me
i also manage to have sex without kissing he did not like that and when walking he always left me behind no matter if i get lost sometimes we got to some places that i never had visited before because he wanted to walk very fast
i was there when he got the news and i stayed with him for few days to console him then one day his ex showed up on his door step
i do not think i would have lasted anyway even if i got in people say in college people are much more mature but i know i would still get bullied either that or just the bigger workload in college on top of hypothetically having to work as well as go to school
there are low wage jobs but i would at least like to make 15 a hour so thankful not have kids a demanding partner a slob of roommate or too much debt that i can not save for the future
it is as if i was not allowing people to show me affection and i do not feel comfortable showing it i am not at ease with it and i run away from relationships out of fear
just next day after we broke up i found out she was already dating a new guy a dude who was as far as i know her best friend and i know for a fact that he literally worshipped her for months or even years i do not really know how long and she was never interested in him and kept him in some sort of friendzone
back in october some fuckers broke into my car and stole tools issued to me by work telling them that i got their tools stolen was extrememly stressful for me and their reaction did not really help
i have tried looking at him in a different light and try to pick what i do not like about him but i love everything about him flaws and all
just please do not comment if it is going to be mean i really do not want to hear that just ignore me please if you going to be mean
i am troubled for most of my life i have always had mental issues and they have all been passed off because my mom ha it stuck in her head that my brother and i have pandispans because we both had cvid correlation not causation and all that crap i admit i played into it because i wanted the attention
it is absurd and i feel so guilty for it but it was like a nightmarenow that i am able to be with my friends irl i can not stand being without them
it is gotten to a point where it feels like there are two sides of my brain well there technically is left and right there are two people inside me constantly bickering and arguing i am tired of always contradicting myself and backtracking
because of family issues i went from good grades to fail all in college all was bad and life said hey let us make it even worse to you so what happened my ex cheated
whenever there is space behind me i am constantly looking at all the windows and closets thinking somebody is there everyone wants me to do better
almost half of my day is taken up on those bullshit online classes they are about 3 hours long and after that i feel so fucking tired i can not do anything
i do not even know what i can do now to fix my mistakes at this point i feel an overwhelming sense of shame and disgust with myself
we met up for coffee today and we hung out for twoish hours and now i feel worse than i had before hand
it has taken a while to write this up and post this here but here i am hoping for a little advice i guess i sort of reached a new low just asking strangers on the internet instead of asking for real help kind of pathetic is not it i do not know why i find that humorous anyway
i do not know what to do i get to spend my birthday with my boyfriend which is awesome but i wish others cared as well
my lack of self esteem got me in a lot of unhealthy relationships i am finally at a point in my life where i realize the pattern
i love his mum so i do not want to stop seeing her and also she has depression so i just do not want to upset her
hell i wore our engagement ring all the way through boot camp despite it not being allowed since we are not married
i am not lonely in the general sense i always have more than 15 dms i failed everytime because my mental health botched all my power functionality
i want to work this out and rebuild our trust but i have too much self respect this is not like you
one can not afford to stay drunk or high all of the time anyway i supported her when her grandfather passed and she felt she has no friends
there were so many red flags like this one time she got confused when her friend told her that he liked her she stopped talking to me completely for a night we would usually talk all day so not talking for a night seemed pretty significant because she thought she liked him back but she did not because it did not feel the same as us
then there was the fourth dream i found myself in my home and could hear a cello being played i walked up the stairs softly and peeked around the corner to see my daughter playing her cello
i can not talk to any of my friends about this because one i do not have many i have like 2 and two i talked to one of my friends about my depression and they made me feel rly guilty about it and now i can not do it and i just want to die and kill myself i am not strong enuf for this world
i guess our safest memories are the ones in their custodyyou know they will be lessvisited and kept in the forgotten spots of their brains
on the lessons like languages history literature where you usually write essays i can not get my thoughts together and focus on writing
since i have ocd fear of gods i use this fear by making promises to gods in order to force myself not to do cd compulsions
i want to put myself out of my misery i am sincerely sorry for any pain my actions may because my mother makes me want to kill myself my mother is poison
it is just whenever i try to talk to my parents about the truth it just always end up in just me being yelled at either if i am telling the truth or not
i have this expectation that we will either become best friends or they will hate me the world is not that black and white
i have been apologizing him through text but he does not want to talk to me at all moreover he wants to breakup with me for crossing his line
if i transitioned from 9 or 10 or whenever the fuck i would have been able to pass and live in secret
after a little prying it turned out that he got blocked by q because he told them the same story and it made them feel uncomfortable and he was then lectured by k about it
sometimes i space out and think about texting you about things that happened during the day then i remember i can not
i just look back all the time whenever i have gone somewhere designed for people to mix and get to know one another that i am always the one or one of the very few who just does not fit in
we still follow each other in social medias and i do not look often but last time i saw he followed a girl i once introduced him to who is pretty scandalous on ig
so yeah not much but i just wanted to let that out that is why i am writing this when i am down but not spiralling
started with a friend getting upset with me and not talking to me for 3 days we have moved on from it kind of because i am not comfortable going to her birthday when she has covid
we spoke for 45 hours on our last call and that was the end of it throughout the call i was coming to terms that it could be our last call the next day was tough and its been a long one week i am still used to checking the notifications to see if there are any texts from her from doing it everyday for the last 9 months
look out for deliberate incitement it may come in disguisethis is a copypaste posting this text to multiple subreddits to get more feedback
we had two wonderful weeks of normality then one day i had to hang out with my gf but i was not feeling well so i asked her to reschedule
he could be a wonderful bf but he stopped trying and i felt so unloved i do want to be friends with him again but barely 2 weeks i need more time to separate him from this version in my head i feel like it was rude to leave but i really just do not want to hear his voice or see him
also around that time my room was finally switched to a different one and since then i am finally allowed to go to bed and sleep normally after 3 years
because of covid they sent me home this whole day has been a web of liesi can not do this anymore trying to get help and get back on meds is impossible right now
has anyone ever been in this situation how do you convince yourself to just move on and that they are not the right person any advice or stories would be so appreciated thanks guys
looking at you in a beautiful wedding dress not being able to hold back the tears as i am so happy knowing that this is all i want
and loving yourself does not mean that you only care about yourself quite the opposite if you find love and compassion within you will inevitably radiate it outwards on the other hand if you do not find love and compassion within yourself you will not be able to broadcast it outwards and you will be a rude shallow person as a result
if i lose my dad i will be completely alone because all of my family lives 2000 miles away i will lose everything if my dad dies
they tolerate me and help me in everyway they can i live in asia so even though i am 18 i can depend on my parents
i have tried replacing it with alcohol nicotineporn shoplifting and anything that is bad for mebut nothing not even the self harm makes me feel good
it does not feel like christmas without her i just want her to yell at me again or something she also did not even love me in the first place so that adds to my depression and loneliness
i am sorry for being overdramatic i just feel alone and i am ready to end it all i am sorry for being so annoying
we are all here because we are already bummed out how about something less depressingyou guessed wrongi live in a metropolis and i am not elderly at all
i have good days and bad days today was great until i saw a photo of her with some friends of hers
as i look back on my life i realize that every time i thought i was being rejected from something good i was actually being redirected to something better
i feel somewhat pathetic that i ask strangers for support but i really do appreciate it it should be my family do you perhaps have any advice for me to start discussing this with my family i am scared that my intended sentiments would be less prioritised or ridiculed i hope it is just pessimism and nothing more but any insight is appreciated
why fear well i guess it is because the hypothalamus did not inform the amydala the beloved will accept them as is
i still talk to my wife for arranging time with the kids and some general talk there is no problems with seeing the kids she even invited me over yesterday and today for a bit for the kids i know i should not get any hopes up that she is softening her hardline of splitting up but i did because we have talking more
i have been doing greater than most postbreakup surroundjng myself with others and giving myself things to do in the spare alone time that i have it is been about a couple months now
bombarded with a crash of weight on my shore i am being dragged back into the unknown as the rip tide pulls me back to where i just swam back from not too long ago
they say they are all here for me and they care about me but hardly show it how do people expect me to believe that i just can not take it anymore
hello there i am a 24 year old bipolar male who is recently homeless and jobless i went to inpatient at fairfax hospital in kirkland washington and left ama i left prematurely due to bad decision making and i talked with my parents and we both agree that i need to go back in
me and my boyfriend would constantly get into arguments because i always did something wrong i was not even trying but there was always something he has anger issues he was a very horny person in general so he wanted to do a lot of physical things that i did not want to do he lied about himself a lot for example he lied about his job whether he is ever done drugs his past relationships etc
i try to do the same before moving to my sisters place but i feel so vulnerable i see him keep contact with friends it had to be girls
i have been parking on one end of the bridge across the canyon every night and have been walking back and forth across this 1500ft bridge in 16 degree weather with wind
that is kind of been the biggest problem because i have never known if so things wrong with me because whenever i say do or think somthing weird i just think in the back of my head that i am making it up for attention so for a long time i kept all these feelings to myself
all of the unconditional support and care i had for her was replaced with seething hatred at the flick of a switch and i am sure to her relief i fucked right off
i have not self harmed or taken my life but i have had the realization that i can just end my life right here and now if i wanted to and there is no real barrier that is keeping me away from doing it
i know he said he does not want to be with anyone but i can not help but wonder if he is talking to people or dating or just do something casual i did not ask him about it because i knew i could not have handled it
english is my second language sorry if i did not make myself clear enoughi am always afraid to talk front of people or to make a presentation
they are dark and scaryi am a 18 year old male living with depression i lost full motivation on the things i found interesting
i have been doing some cbt of and on last 2 years with a psychologist 3 weeks back i went to psychiatrist due to massive anxiety my cousin was getting married and i was getting panic attacks
but lately when i think about going out and partying i almost resent it for some reason in my head i think there is better ways to be spending your time helping others than just getting drunk
the first breakup was because there have been some fights between usbut in the mean time she started talking to another person
i did some work and completed my checklist tonight i am having dinner with friends dressing up to make myself feel good
how do you go about managing something that might upset you or make you angry i know i am not the only one feeling this way but i am sick of not having friends
4 i will probably be blind in 2021 if an eye doctor fucks up a surgery where they are cutting my eye open to correct a muscle so i would rather be dead than blind
he was praising the housemate for being interested as she was making noises like aha though i later talked to her this noise was just made as she knows he does not like criticism so he interpreted her confirmation totally wrong
no happy memories to show for it just a pointless ordeal full of mistakes any tips on dealing with that kind of regret
she realized she was caught she sat in the drivers seat saying absolutely nothing while my unbridled fury erupted at the discovery
i feel like i am using my phone as a coping mechanism and when my parents fight or when i am just lonely i have a tendency to have a panic attack
the third time was when my confidence was at an all time low or why he has not reached out i feel so alone i do not feel like talking to anyone new
everything in life is given to me i should be so thankful and so happyhas anyone ever been in a similar situation that could offer me advice
our relationship was not perfect but it had the potential to be he tells me it is fine but i do not believe him i can not believe him
friends come and go no one truly loves me they just see me and think they love an idea of me
ever since i have been using games as a coping method and have been disossaciating from close friends and am slowly but surely burning my friendships away that i have spent so much hard work building
i moved back home and we entered a longdistance grey area we never actually even talked about if we were staying together or what the plans might be i suppose this was both of our faults she was probably scared to talk about it and i had not even seriously thought about it
well maybe i am stupid cuz i helped her with whatever she is going through with that crush and i think eventually she knew she is being played after that she became so distant of me and try to push me away
everyone can somehow exaggerate their feelings and experiences so much that it seems to fit with some mental illness emptiness and feeling at the same time
over the years i have gotten worse and worse and yesterday when i was babysitting and today i burst out in anger and started screaming and threatening and chasing them
i think being vague helps with succeeding at committing suicide so when i do i will completely wipe this account and burn and delete any mentions of my mental health
i miss my best friendthis is going to be a long post but i need to get everything off my chest
where i am going to stay how i am going to get somewherei have to serve people who are in control of their lives and enjoying it everyday
hello everyone i am a 18 years old male and yesterday my girlfriend now ex came out in a call with me and we needed to break up
to keep the story short i had a healthy pregnancy besides my type one diabetes but i took care of myself
she told me of her past experiences in other major cities as well it made sense the experience that shaped her thinking i wanted to do everything in my power to make her feel homely in my city but she would not want to leave her city for her mother for whom she was her only emotional support things just seemed to take a pivot
although to some extent the fact that i loved him did not allow me to drink all the pills at the first attempt at suicide
i really have the strongest urge to text her but why on earth would i ever want to get back with someone who was capable of cheating on me for a year out of 3 emotionally only supposedly it truly baffles me how i would ever be able to just overlook that betrayel
is it ever okay to reach out via text plus i have a book he lent me maybe i could also let him know that since it is been a good amount of time is this me just grasping at straws to talk to him because i miss him honestly do not know what to do but can not keep fighting this urge without guidance
i am afraid of falling back into the hole and spending every night crying and with that feeling that is like being stabbed in the chest or could get worse i am lost
so i got in a relationship that only caused me pain and broke my heart i do not know why i do this but i guess it is because i always feel alone
even if they do they stop responding after their first message to me did you just want to acknowledge that i said something
i feel like if there is some deity that granted my wish to be cured of depression they are pissed at me for being ungrateful for being too happy
so i could not use the fear of promises because i knew that the promises are fake and do not count
love yourself you got shit to do and that way you will have less time to think about your ex and have the chance to be the best version of yourself
i feel like my mind of being overtaken with negative thoughts i hate and do not want to think about i miss having my own thoughts and being in control i hate it so much i feel like my techniques are going and are slowly failing i just feel stuck i feel like i am going to lose but i really do not want to
i can not help feeling like i have no fucking control over anything right now including this stupid relationship i keep having thoughts about killing myself and i can not stop it
but the thing is i am 100 uncomfortable in communicating with her even now but i do not have any grudge against her
when i came back to my hometown for the first time many friends of mine started ignoring me a friend i used to know since we were 12 invited me to celebrate new year eve and after 2 weeks he unfollowed me from ig and stopped replying to my dms anywhere
i lose my mothermy heart is burning i want to my mom backi have pain in my headi feel lost and lonelyi am so cold i can not continue
a couple days after recognizing this pattern i made an appointment with a local psychologist which happened tonight i broke up with my boyfriend too
sure it is sad but it would be easier for my family financially and my friends will not have to see me in pain
he told me that we should call it a break from each other and that i still had to be loyal towards him
i spent the whole night feeling sick and watching other peoples snapchat stories trying to work out if he was still flirting with her and who the girl was i am horrified at myself this is not something id ever see myself doing i am not a crazy exgirlfriend but i literally could not help myself
january 2nd is my birthday and i have made it my goal to enjoy my last days i do appreciate the support people are trying to give me but they can not help my future
well we had a fight a couple weeks ago and i eventually let everything out that i was holding in to him
i am the middle of three children on my mothers side the oldest on my fathers my mother was absent often in her room in her own little world
towards the last few months i really treated him as my best friend at times since the romance was really lacking
they are all good people and surely they deserve someone better i always feel like i am just a burden and i just wish i could fucking dissappear
mind shifthttpswwwanxietycanadacomresourcesmindshiftcognitive20behavioural20therapy20 free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety
i do not want to know anyone but something is pricking me deep down i want to talk to somebody about my day laugh with somebody and just enjoy time together
it is been about a month since my girlfriend of two years broke up with me i am losing it then i managed to get this house for myself where obviously he could stay it became our home
i have lost all and any hope for the future and have very suicidal thoughts every day such as jumping off the building taking pills stabbing myself
i would also like to leave the situation and get my own place to live but i am worried about my abuser calling the police who will absolutely believe them over me and telling them i am suicidal or homicidal so they will hunt me down and force me to return
i feel like i messed up the best relationship i have ever had because i was running away from myself and i was not present i can not seem to accept the breakup although i do not have much hope she will come back
a long time ago i made terrible mistakes that ended in me losing the most wonderful girl i have ever met
also i was told that this new girl confessed her love to one of his best friends a week before they started hanging out
i am constantly worried usually without any particular reason i overthink a lot to the point where i rarely sleep because my thoughts do not let me to
this issue has been bothering me a lot lately and i can not find anything on the internet about it i can only find studies on aphantasia but it is nothing like this
a hopeful medical student but that seems further away day by day one of two sonsoverall i have a documentary in the works that i am producing
some people are really just born to die i am giving it time because i do hope things will improve but i do not think they will
i will be at work doing dishes and i struggle to think i have trouble remembering my memories from just a few months ago like biking with friends
is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy
what ends up happing is i end up talking to guys who i am not physically attracted to but have good personalities because i guess there is not that pressure there that if i fuck up and say something weird that they will not like me instead i can be way more myself because i know that i just want to be friends with them
i just want to be able to have a genuine conversation with someone like a normal person i do not want to be alone
honestly i understand what hes going through i went through the same thing just under 2 years ago so i get that he needs time to heal
i was born to a mother who was hooked on heroin and cracki never believed in it but i do nowalways remeber you will come out of it
month later he started fat shaming me we have a dog together so that is one of the reasons i do not want to let go
i had this whole story to write for npr and the major newspaper of the state about how the poverty social safety net is utterly broken nonexistent in america yes even in a blue state
if anyone has any kind of idea about what this might be about please share i hate myself even more now than i have ever before i want to die
i know i was a child and that i was groomed and that he took advantage of my vulnerability however whenever i think of him i am flooded with memories and feel like my chest in collapsing
i snapped from discovering a horrible revaluation on something going on in the house my mom began panicking i wonder if tonight i am going to try to end myself
recently i have been feeling really disconnected and i feel like i am drawing away from the people who matter most in my lifw i was out with my friend and sometimes when he said things it seemed like cringy and i would catch myself thinking why did he say that
i am not sure what is wrong with me i feel strong suicidal tendencies i have tried medication therapy and have implemented many changes to my lifestyle regarding nutrition and sleep the reason for such is that i feel like life is meaningless for these reasons
the fact that you can not do anything you want even when you put all ofyour willpower into it just makes me more depressed and more likely to be unable to do any of it
i proved that point time and time again 30000 in divorce court fees trying to win my children so i could guarantee that they would have a parent who would always be there
these opportunities were always much further away from the distance we already had between us and well that opportunity came and he is moving 10 hours away from me
at some point she chose i was no longer worth the time and energy anymore she wanted to have tinder why because her best friend wanted to send guys that she liked to her
i feel like i will be happier when i find a job but what then will there be another unrealistic goal after that will there never be my own happy ending i do not know
that does not mean some people has not helped though it is temporary help they have tried hard to make me take a shower and then change the subject into a pleasant conversation which makes me forget i am grateful but it feels like i am only delaying the inevitable and i feel like a burden it must be draining
i am not there on any social media either so this was literally it i have no contact with any school mates
if you want specific components or features or aesthetics choose a machine that has them do not think that you can buy something inexpensive and add those aspects yourself
then as we were talking he told me he was meeting someone from work but choose to end it with her for me which i told him do whatever you feel is right it hurt me i have never met him but spoke on the fone and messaged eachother everyday
i am so lonely i miss my former friends everyday but they all left to live a better life without me
we never talked about it after that never done this with an ex before but i have never tried to be friends with an ex before
i reinstated everything to her and sat with her and made sure she changed all of her passwords to something that i would not know
like i said i did not usually cry easily for the dumbest things like i do right now i did not know who or where to ask about this so that is why i am posting it here
remember you were hurt not broken do not allow yourself to selfdestruct trust me it is the easy way out i was broken up with out of the blue but it is never out of the blue

this piece means a lot to me and i want to end the year on a positive note most importantly bring awareness that people are not alone and provide something positive for the internet
i want to end my life so much but i can not do it my dog will never understand why i left her and she is the only soul i care for and i would never do anything to hurt her
it was clear as day but she could not apologize because apologizing would mean she would have to open herself up to her feelings of shame and that is something she pushes further into the recesses of the shadow sides of her personality and disowns
she said it was just not a healthy relationship anymore and that she can not do it i felt like my world had crashed into pieces
mid may i returned to my dorm to continue studying although all was online and shopping for food was not always easy
funny moment happened today i went to do urine test today collected a sample and went to the nurse she was shocked because the sample collection was in the toilet i was not aware of my own surroundings and lacked presense of mind
i tried to kill myself very recently no one knows i took a break from social media but i do not think anyone suspects anything
i tried then so hard tried everything i could to keep her at least until i come back so we can discuss and talk about things to find solution but i just felt like she became more and more distant
this drove her further from me i told her to me it is not that big of a deal and i had no problems going back to work the next day she told me of i refused to make the statement then she did not know if she could be with anymore i refused to do it and she was upset
a while ago i found out that for suicide survivors and those who used to self harm the represents that you could have ended your life but you did not
i emailed her last night before i read the message thanking her for saving my life but i feel really guilty because what if she thinks i am still the same 8 year old
i have a really annoyingly good memory and write things down that did not make sense but i slowly stopped doing this with her because i felt crazy
he said are you s friend then it hit me the day before she started acting weird she was on the phone with this guy
anyways it turned toxic very quickly his anger his moods were not pretty it is a much better method of trying to overcome it
and it is ended with me getting dumped by the girl i thought i would marry because of long distancewhich is why i have two very simple questions
edit there is a typo in the title how sad i am a 18 year old male from australia i have had alot of great things happening to me lately
in the last weeks i tried to get my friends to continue with me our yoga routine and to get them with me to simply study in the discord which they told me later in a chat just feels wrong for them and they feel used so they excluded me from the group by opening a new one they told me that later after weeks
if something is broken it needs to be fixed or replaced which means when you are calling yourself broken you need to be fixed or replaced
dear reader i know you need a friend if you read this so if you ever need anyone feel free to email me misterimperfect24gmailcom i believe i can help you and i am always here to listen and be a friend so remember you are loved
we are both 25 now in the beginning of our relationship i was in a bad spacewe went out with a group and one of his best female friends 34f was there
i was determined not to spend today at home wallowing in my loneliness so i blew a few hundred bucks at the casino instead got a burger and fries there a chocolate chip cookie and diet pepsi too got them after i realized i had not eaten in 16 hours oops lol
i want to not be lonely anymore but that means interacting with other people and other people are dogshit i want to have friends but that means trying to maintain contact with other people and every time i have tried to do that i just pushed others even farther away i want to have a sexual relationship but vaginas are attached to other people and as stated before other people are dogshit
basically i do not feel very well mentally and i do not know if this is anxiety or depression or something symptoms sounds more like anxiety
pain is worse at night however pain can occur at any time and does endure a complete day if we possibly find love long term relationship
to be drowning and instead of someone helping you they either ignore you or tell you you need to help yourself
now here i am i tried to reach out they do not care i am sitting alone in my apartment i am popping xanax and chugging wine every minute in my tiny little tub
then he said that he is confused first i say i want to not talk but then i ask him why he has been quiet and that he does not know whether i want friendship or to fix our relationship with the lunch date idea and that if i wanted the latter he does not know how it would work due to him climbing the ladder at his job and me not wanting to get out of my comfort zone and leave mine
i am such a hermit and i do not want to be like this it is covid time so i can not really go anywhere but my friends just look so much better than me
also on a side note i can not stand normally anymore i stand like i am playing twister i do not think this is too big of a deal since i do not stand too normally anyways
of course i was ignored now i am on the lash outi am currently studying for exams in january but no matter how hard i try i still feel so stupid
and thanks for reading stay strong2nd edit i posted upd8 for those who care oh and he was my best friend since i was 11 about to be homeless again
he is constantly trying to get me to agree to go live in china saying it would be so much better than america and blah blah blah
time and time again i want to do it so badly it would be so simple and chances are no one would find me for a bit of time until i went missing and they find my service truck
heartbreak does not have to break you and actually it can not you do not have to feel that i want you to know that your break up does not break you
i want him to hold me i want to give him kisses and hugs and tell him it will be okay but i just can not
she got furious and started following me around the house screaming that she did all this for me and i ruined it and that i never think of her needs and that she leaves to serve me
then she started making up excuses why we were not hanging out anymore first she said she was grounded than after her grounding ended she said she could not make time for me because of work she still kept treating it like it was a relationship
i am sorry that i are not got time for my friends but i am too busy doing nothingwhite powder on my black screen why is nobody calling
i was stupid enough to get married at 21 to the 2nd girl who was nice to me and i was that desperate because it was very rare that someone paid attention to me
now i am sure at least a few of us can relate to the idea of pretending to be more sick than we actually are big tasks at school the next day maybe you did something embarrassing at work or school and you can not bear to face your peers
i am pretty sure i did not die but maybe pieces of me did i live my valhalla every day working towards reducing revictimization and finding a solution to systemic problems
i often feel as though it would have been much better if i would never existed in the first place my parents would not be so held back by me i would not have caused any misery i definitely did in life etc etc
and i find myself wondering what it means that so many of the people i know who were born in the 1990s or later get their nutritional dose of goofing it up from watching youtubers do it for them whereas those of us who were born before the 1990s got our nutritional dose of goofing it up from getting friends together and doing it ourselves instead of experiencing it only vicariously
no one gives a fuck about me not even my own family i have the noose tied and the rope ready
i know that and yet i let myself get too attached way too soon because i trusted him because of the things he said because of the way he made me feel and the way he acted
from what i see with cases involving old successful celebrities that commit suicide and proof with people that post on here that are older than me life does not get better for most
its getting slightly rougher rn i am kind of back to even cuttingyeah i know you all will just say that is life life is unfair
i laugh or smile from a shitty joke or meme and i ask myself if i am really sad or if i am faking it for attention i am a mess
well they cry a lot in the first 23 days but usually that is because they feel guilty they know they broke your heart after promising you non stop that they would never do this
my heart gets hurt over shit that does not bother you my head torments me over shit i can not controli was talking to him while he was about to attempt
it does not mean i do not want the best for him it had built up inside of me so much that i definitely lost it on her over text rinstant_regret
can i put an end to this breakdown i do not want to see how low i can drop i set my whole life on fire and am basically throwing gasoline on it
my recent university graduation is pyyrhic at best as i was pre depression prior to entering it and now i walk out this complete hollow who will probably lose his sanity sooner then later
i am trying to find a job but i have only worked in food service i am a month late on rent and i am 99
how can i diminish all type emotions about her from my mind as it is been four years and she gave me so much pain i do not want to keep any type of feelings for her
and what i need is not talking here it is this is what happens to me she told me i was crazy paranoid and i should apologise and so i went over and did
and after some talking i found a veeeeeeeeeeryy trange thingslike i can move my balcon abit upsideand top balcon closer to y window
when they do find out that i died they may be sad for a minute or think yah she was nice but that is it
the third dream i saw my daughter to her first day of school i cried letting her go on the bus and seeing that excited smile from behind the window
i really wish this condition had more research done on it because seeing as there is no data on the topic and only 13 of people in the world have it i feel so alone and as though i have no hope or anyone to talk to about it
my family are well aware of my depression and i will be blunt in that talking about it does nothing to talk about it for me i am just leeching off them more then i already am at that point
ever since middle school i imagine myself in thrilling situations such as having superpowers or leading a revolution with usually accompanying musicmedia like trailers
my mom will buy you tons of treats toys games and gadgets heavily regulate them then call you spoiled because you have so much stuff that you can not use at all or that are so heavily parental controlled that they are paperweights when grandma died an we were all depressed and needed therapy she did not bother when i talked about needing it once before this i did not get it i am stuck
i never wanted to go behind my best friends back in order to contact my ex gf because i did not want to betray her trust like that
sometimes thinking about makes me feel apathetic and other times it makes me feel sad i think that it will be one of those life events that changes you permanently
hell i still carry a picture of her in my wallet and while i was in boot camp i kissed it every night just to keep me sane and remind myself i was loved once soon a time and i kept our ring on even though i was not supposed to
and then one day she told me how he is the best person to be alive cuz he sings for her and talk that makes her feel like she is a baby
i have no friends a wonderful girlfriend though who i share some interests with but she is more into commercial pop music pop punk etc
they say going to a therapist is for crazy people they act like getting help is something that is out of this world
i can not remember the last happy birthday or christmas i had it is just feel like a reminder that i will not fit no matter wherever i am and the only thing in my head is trying to be alone again so i can cry in comfort praying with anger to god to kill me so it will not be so hurtful to anyone that might care
i wasted 2 years being depressed skipped classes and did nothing now i finally get things together finally i have a goal in my life and enthusiasm to self learn
hey everyone i am currently trying to find out how one could make the lives of busy professionals a lot easier
i am an only child and my biological dad was not a big part of my life he and my mom divorced before i even turned a year old
i have pushed to understand myself and correct as i go along and all i can say is while these law few months have not been the best
i spent 3 years hopping from one woman to the next just really learning to love myself and setting standards that i would never deviate from
the scars are simply a part of you and your tragedies do not define you the reason i am writing this post is i can not remember my dreams anymore
i implied i was going to kill myself a days ago and two people checked up to see if i was fine and left immediately after
this quarantine does not help to meet new people and i feel so lonely and stuck i can not believe i am living like that
all my conversations in messenger are about me giving information that they need for school and that is it i have a pretty gf my classmates are jealous but i can not even function like normal dude
i am not sure how reddit works so i hope i am doing this right but anyways like when we have problems it is always me thinking of solutions but he just play games to avoid
and it is when i have attacked out of complete and utter confusion the good people in my life the ones with heart because one person or two her brother likes to attack its weak spot for massive damage
i feel like i fell into a black hole again i feel worthless abondoned and just stupid again all i wanted to do was apologize and understand the situation i just wanted to not feel so empty anymore i just wanted to make things right on the situation
but i have experienced this before and i regret experiencing it again my whole school years 13 year to 17 year i was traumatised and to today i am still
its not easy to just change my coping mechanism and suddenly be vulnerable no matter how much i want to i wanted to be better version of myself for her
here is the best thing about developing a healthy dose of selfworth it helps you attract emotionally and mentally healthy women instead of more toxic wrecks due to a phenomenon called the confirmation bias and it also makes you more attractive and appealing in general
he said he did not think it was a good idea anymore and that he did not want the commitment that he changed his mind
that being said i still love her so fucking much and i am going to be completely torn after tomorrow the thought of her being with someone else makes my heart hurt so bad i do not know how to cope or what to do to avoid contact with her and stay away if she tries to come back
i am sure i am going to get some comments either good or bad i do not really care what i care about is everyone is well being
my ex 26f broke up with me 24m day before halloween in the last little while we had not talked to each other for like 30 odd days she did not text me but dropped off a present a week and a half ago out of nowhere she left it on the doorstep present was something small and the card just said best wishes
i guess he did not want me to die at his place so he offered to bring me home i went through hell while he was furious about taking revenge on some people who owe him money he did not care about me but said we are going to stay sober for two weeks it would be easy for him he said
i still do not know if i should delete it for good though because whatever he does that is on his conscience and i should not give a fuck about if or at least show that
then covid unexpected then forcing me into solitude to sit with myself sit in my alcohol abusedrug abuse and allow it to unravel release and unlearn
tldr i watched some spooky internet stuff and am freaking way out over it men in their late 20s30s like what the hell is that about
i have just back moved back to my home country aftee 6 years abroad and my dad allowed me to work at his chinese restaurant till i enlist into the army but its so lonely whenever i tell my emotionally unavailable dad who is always working he would go i am lonely as well i should not have to talk to my friends who are all overseas and rely on them sigh
did i do the right thing is looking out for myself more important than offering compassion i feel like i am in peace with death in some way
so my 28f boyfriend 28m broke up with me on sunday he made it seem that it was very final and i have been trying hard to accept that but really struggling i have been thinking about the things that were wrong with the relationship and trying to accept that it was not to be
i have finally trained myself to stop doing this somehow potentially because i am practicing grounding techniques and meditation but anyone know what this could be a symptom of
i was admittedly a little overwhelmed this really shocked her subconsciously she was a bit like a mom to me that is also why i am so fucked up by this
i am trying to get a therapist but it is taking a while and idk what to do until i can get help
i have reached out this week and just wished him a good week and another time to ask if i had mail
so reddit do you think a therapist could help me even though it is more than 2 years since it happened do a therapist even help with this kind of stuff any advice
or will not find anyone as caring and patient as my ex i know that i will eventually she never gave me an answer not a no not a yes just silence
but it was not easy and i laugh at myself not those who are going through the process of a breakup it takes time and sometimes therapy mostly crying in therapy sessions where you think that you are being overdramatic especially for a guy
then i discover that she suspected i was reading her texts and actually deleted all of the screenshots she sent him screenshots of our argument
now alex wants me back and actually wants to move in together which is what i want and now i am on the fence about how to handle this whole situation my thing is i am afraid for alex to move on because i feel that he will be successful in everything once he moves on there is way more to the story but for now what advice can you guys give
plus i usually stay at home rather than cultivate my relationships with my peers i want someone who understands me but i am like this
since then i have tried to stay away from guys in general just to let myself heal and make sure i do not use anyone to get over him
have you ever been so alone that you would not recognize people of your age faces seem strange and surprising when interacting face to face in a crowd they all blend each other
never i try to make everyone feel happier than i ever feel so they do not have to live a life like mine or feel the way i feel see the things i see hear the things i hear
i get up to get food and think of what i want until it hits me how much energy it will take
the next few days i floated around aimlessly woman would talk to me but it did not feel right nothing felt right their lips moved and i drowned out in radio silence because they did not speak my language because there was a miracle occupying my mind already and her name was xxx
my family treats me differently and i have never been too affected by it because i am good at hiding my emotions from not only them but also myself
i suffered nightmares and dreams my entire life leaving me more tired than when i went to sleep i had vivid memories or every awful thing warning me to be safe
it is only day 2 off the game so i know today just sucks and i am just venting to some random people online
so you see folks that is six great reasons to commit suicide now for reasons i should not commit suicide there are not many i do not even know if i am going to do it yet i am probably going to decide a bit and see if i feel as shitty as i do tomorrow i just hate life
i feel so alone in this world like i do not belong and i feel like i can not relate to anyone around me
i do not have a very strong sense of who i am beyond my obsession with being a famous musician i do not know what my personality traits are i do not know how to describe myself and i do not know what makes me me
example i spent a night in the local hospitals covid ward for observation the room they gave me had not been cleaned prior to me being placed in it as evidenced by the full bins and urine in the toilet
nothing notably bad has even happened recently how can i still be so miserable living just gives me more stress and depression i am not even sure that i identify with my biological sex so i can not even be happy with my body either
my mom was my last family member i had my ex told me she wanted to apologize about what she did
the feeling of being calm is not common to me so i wanted to sharei am a junior at my dream university
i feel like i have the plague because it is a laugh being on any dating site at 60 and disabled at that not allot of money
eventually our relationship began to sour more and more after our distance i spent all of high school in absolute isolation because of my fear and bitterness of people
my belongings were stolen in one of my previous foster homes last year the agency failed to reimburse me for everything
probably why i am depressed as heck lol i do not have family to be around either so i am just sitting at home lonely as hell
i would like to see what life has to offer i really do but with each passing day it gets harder to justify wanting to be alive
i stayed in the first room for 1 month then they moved me to the room down the hall for another month
i have been physically abused by my father and two intimate partners but whenever i talk about it i feel ashamed or weak as though it is my fault for letting it happen
i just want to stop stalking her but i can not i can be good 99999999 of the time but the one time i slip up it sets me back i have tried blocking her but i just unblock her and then look at her profile and then reblock her i really need to improve my selfcontrol because this is just selfsabotage at this point
i have not slept on my front for years i attempt to avoid sleeping on side but sometimes unachievable however this can lead to a very painful following day starting as early as when i wake up
i have been gaslighted and manipulated by him i have taken an 8hr trip to see him in the past just for him to say i do not have feelings for you and months later he would say i always liked you i just did not stick around in the relationship
i keep a note on my phone reminding me of that hoping it will inspire me to skip meals eating pizza feels like holding a gun to my head
a day before christmas 6 days before the year 2020 will end i just got the worst news in my life i have an 8cm ovarian cyst left and when i was about to text my almost a year boyfriend about it i received a message from him that he does not want to continue our relationship anymore
i sound pathetic but i am just scared i am going to lose him if i lost him it would be my fault in the first place of course if he broke up with me i would not do anything like beg him to stay i think
this is the first time i am single and i am liking the freedom i finally feel free as i do not have to text someone everyday i do not have to wonder why did not they text me i do not have to wonder why is he behaving the way he is
how she can not function properly because she is worried about me and how my family is suffering because my presence is so depressing
i went to the local bridge and spent the whole day there considering jumping but in the end i was too much of a pussy
i am so curious so if anybody has any more informed thoughts from this description please leave them below tldr saw a man profanely arguing with himself and looking for ideas on what could because this
i have been having some pretty bad imposter syndrome lately and i have been thinking that my friends are just humoring me and taking pity on me but yesterday my friend sent a message to my friends discord saying and this is a direct quote
am i wrong for wanting a romantic relationship with a girl who only sees me as a tool rather than a human
i tried one medication for a month last month to give a better time frame it gave me awful migraines and i could not get out of bed past 4 pm
and now i am just wasting my parents money pretending to understand all these classes i really want someone else to have my place
but i finished my presentation pretty ok i believe later on hers feedback she asked me why i want to talk about the part that she had made me skip and if i thought that my part were special enough for her to listen that when i started to shaking she saw that and told me front of my class that i need to control my emotion it triggered me when someone talk about my mental i came back to my seat could not hold back my tears i do not know why i cared to much about what she had said to me but i am mad at myself even more because i can not stop thinking about it or crying over that
i grew far from this person i once was before changing so much about myself and how i looked no one would ever expect that would ever be me
pharma push is it okay be a dependant on a so call pill or actually it can help me over the long term
earlier this year i purchased a hand gun and there is honestly not much from just getting it out of its holster and pulling the trigger
this made my selfharm urges worse i would stop myself from looking at pictures of any gender because doing it would make my urges worse
only thing i managed to do is to get clean since i am broke basically was forced to do it i have no purpose no direction and i feel worthless
i love him so much i do not want to ever be with someone else i do not want him to be with someone else
i have been selfharming since the beginning of university for about 4 years particularly i scratch the insides of my elbows until i draw blood
i am happily married with a beautiful daughter i have friends mostly through my work but i can not seem to understand what makes me feel this way
posted a few days ago and honestly i am not doing any better someone who can not take any responsibility for their life and has a delusional representation of hisher worth
i can not even look at any substance without just wanting to get so fucking high or drunk that i forget my name
then we talked and he is like how are you i casually say i am okay wbu then he says a lot better recently and then i ask if its because of her
does not seem like i can make friends because people are either socialising with far more interesting people occupying themselves on phones or blasting music down their airpods
the last few months have been worsening my depression my friends are going through things and have been leaving me out of activities i am fairly certain i have diddissociative identity disorder i went 4 months without contacting my friends and they never wondered about me but one of them goes a week without texting and everyone else is worried anyway here is the week so far
for example if i had a big red button that would instantly vaporize every person on earth with the virus i would press it without hesitation
the only person who knows me on a level deeper than anyone else the only one who loved me and showed me pure kindness
because i truly loved her that is just a fact we planned on getting married building a future together we also would still have sex sometimes
it is been 2 weeks since she ghosted me i am greatly suffering from this we as human beings all live lives as waves
in india it is an extremely competitive exam and only a few hundred can succeed out of hundreds of thousands of students
i am looking for any sign of hope after this hard break upthis is the third day since my bf has moved out form our place
hey thereguess you are here because you are are not mentally are not feeling well or just down in the moment or might be something else
but with this breakup i am so confused she is so happy and carefree in group texts i have no idea what the fk i have to do
the reason was that we were both too busy with school and she told me she felt single in the days leading to our breakup
autistic female so no friends because i am a fucking weirdo also have cerebral palsy john also has mental health problems and has had them worsen too over this year
throw away acc i know you were drunk and she coerced you i know you love me and that i am your world
i can not even imagine dating someone else right now how is he already okay i am driving myself psycho i am not sure why i wrote all of this out or what reply i am looking for just sucks and with christmas this week how do i even fake happy
it is like my head just wants to fuck with me lately it happened again and this time she is almost left me because of it
i hope anyone else going through the same thing reads this and knows that they are not the only ones going through stuff like this
i am struggling with my mental health and feelings of loneliness since the summer i feel like an outcast in my family and try to avoid them whenever possible as i feel panicked and awkward around them this has led me to switch to a night schedule so i sleep through the day
this new girl hes with i know they have a lot in common and has the same circle of friends so i am just left with the thought of why would be come back to me when he could be with her when they first were hanging out he took her to do some of his hobbies that we had been talking about doing together which makes me feel like they are bond is super strong
when he broke up with me he gave me very conflicting reasoning behind it and everything he said was contradictory to his actions in the past 8 months which was when he stated he started having issues ie saying he has a hard time seeing a future with me when we had been recently talking about moving out together and were actively planning for the future says he does not love me in the way you are supposed to love someone you want to marry yet within those 8 months he had given me a promise ring and said he wanted to marry me someday
i was so much into her than she was into me i missed her the moment she left the city i had begun planning for outings half a month prior to her visiting me and on the day she left i was only planning the next best dates to visit her in her city
the weird part is we still were talking facetiming and occasionally seeing each other from augusta little after the election in november
trying to be strong here even though i want to break down already keeping the tears from eyes not to fall down
she was happily married and later i saw pictures of her mother visiting her so i thougth maybe it is not so bad
bi can not even dress myself to wear i look good i def do not belong in la i hate everything about me i do not want to write this but maybe someone else is like me
like i am not already suffering as it is instead of apprecaiting me in my possible final moments you leave and do not look back
i broke up because i felt that this was wrong on her because she was so good to me we very very rarely fought she did not give a fuck about money or lane having moneymade me smarten up and stop selling drugsshe did not make me forcing me to do it it was more she would say i worry about you doing it and so on and eventually i made the decision to stop on my ownshe never broke my balls over stupid shit like wanting to see my friends a lot she completely understood my friends are a big part of my life and she never done me wrong e
our schedules are quite opposite as she works from 8 am to 6 pm and i work from 430 pm to 11 pm
ever since when i attempted i kept having these episodes of just thinking nothing was real or that i was in a movie or something like that is that normal
i have talked through my problems but no matter what they look me in the face every time i look in the mirror
but i am certain it will probably drain me out i will not have as much time as i really need to study
i am 20 years old and i got diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety when i was 12 since then nothings gotten better i have suicidal thoughts all the time and i hate myself and have issues making friends
the minute i am alone plan to take a huge dose of all the pills i can find obviously i will try taking a way bigger dose of the ones that are more lethal and dangerous i still plan to lock myself up in the bathroom and run a bathe because at least there is the possibility i would drown if i fall into a coma for example as i already had in the past
he had been off the drink for months gotten himself healthy and into shape and i was not aware it was not always like that
who then came out and yelled at us as a collective and some individually about how we should not do that
and if she needed help i was there so i did not ask any questions though i wanted to be i could not be an interactive student
i feel like the person i am is not like able so to survive middle school high school and the years after i always had to fit a role to get along with people and connect with them
i know i need help but i literally do not want it i do not want to live a life without her by my side
i will admit that in the past i made some mistakes and i think that i deserve to life and think like this that i deserve it to be broken i hate myself for the person who i be
i fucking love you so much i want you to know that i am doing this for you i am staying out of your life because i know who i am right now is not the best version of who i can be and i do not want to hurt you i never want to hurt you again
keep in mind that while these steps are simple and proven to help getting results with them takes time and repetition discipline and a considerable dose of effort
lol so basically i am a failure of a daughter and a girlfriend and i would be better off dead god does not exist because if he did he would not have burdened everyone in my life with my existence i am unlovable and wish i could just disappear off the face of the earth
i really mean it and felt it from her that is another one of the many reasons i really thought she was the one
everyone is an asshole to me everybody always leaves me on read and not to mention this dumbass virus between the virus and just people on my life i can not take it anymore
and we are still kind of in the same clubs and stuff so there is no way i can have no contact with him either
my blood coagulated and stopped the bleeding at some pointi spent five hours speaking with people through suicide prevention hotlines last night
i woke up with my father telling me that my ex gf was waiting for me outside crying i had lost my phone that night so i checked my instagram and saw tons of messages
eventually in october we all went to my house in the mountains but i was seeing she was texting with this guy for most of the time
will i find someone new i am about five months out of my breakup and things have gotten noticeably better and easier
anyway he told me that if i wanted him to change i should just go get someone else and well he did not particularly talk nice at all that day
i was just going to block him but my boyfriend is saying do not block him and just keep being nice until he goes away because he fears for my safety
she came back on halloween i later found out that on that day something had changed she started to lose feelings for me all of a sudden
i had a couple of bad moments this year but it is not only the bad moments i think about constantly it is every single bad interaction i have had with people a lot of them happened when i was in middle school and i am 21 years old now but i still remember those memories so vividly and how i felt when they happened that it is as if they had happened recently
her issue was with regards to the location as we lived in cities on either end of the country and when she got back to me i did flag this out but she said that maybe we could give it a go despite the same
i have had a few one night stands where i just wanted the sex to be over so i could hold someone and this lonely feeling is painful i just really want love
what do i do what should my parents do any advice is appreciated we only had one argument over the entire relationship and besides that we were great together
it is jut hard to move on while i was at boot camp all i thought about was her not my family not my phone or friends
i have found a list of numbers that can be contacted for people in the uk who may have a need to reach out this year a lot of us are away from our families and friends and it can be a lonely place to be
i feel better alone i am outed and shunned by family and friends only seem to reach out when i can be of some service i have actually and recently had a long time friend reach out for sex and i complied to fullfil a need but was cast out almost immediately i do not want death but i crave darkness and solitude
i think that is the hardest part of losing him for me just feeling isolated again and realizing how few people i actually have
and sadly very often our feelings are sometimes more related with a time where a good ass indicated a good chance for survival
all of a sudden i have basically been ghosted by her and we planned to go another date literally 2 days ago
like i said i do not think i have ever thought that female pornstars are less than human but i definitely had some prejudices against them ever since yesterday and after watching christy mack in court i have 100 changed my opinion about it being a pornstar is a job and people are flatout wrong when they judge pornstars and sexworkers because of the work that they do
she said no reiterated her need for space and said i want to be friends and hopefully i will get to that point where i can talk to you soon
my friend is obsessing or i assume about what mental illnesses she might have and it is causing a lot of extra stress and confusion throughout the day for her
it is only now that i have spent time with her and she is not here that i realize i really do not like being alone so much
i am sorry for asking too much everyone has too much on their shoulders already if ill manage to cry ill let a few tears drop for me yes yes why do not i fucking cry about it yes yes
again this was our first relationship ever so i do not blame him because he did not know what he was doing but i feel like he still could have been nicer
i hate that i am like this and i do not want to be ever since i was little my mother has always screamed at me to stop obsessing over things and i thought that was just her being a dick but now that i get older it scares me because aha think she is right i do obsess but i can not help it
i have been having some suicidal thoughts but i just try to ignore them i am texting this in hopes that somehow someone on here can help me
i do not really feel joy or excitement much anymore and i am not sure i am really even sadi am just so tired of not feeling anything genuine
another person on reddit wrote this but it did not have that many replies and i have experienced the same thing all my life anyone know anything about this
today was great surprisingly it is been one of the best christmases me and my family have had in a while i have got some amazing gifts and could not be happier
somehow i just cannot seem to be a friend i have no close friends that i feel like i can share things with i have a couple friends that i can hang out with or share memes with but it all seems to be small talk empty conversations when i am going through something or just want to express myself i have no one to go to
thinking about killing othersm23 ex f23 she broke up with me 3 weeks ago and the reason was long distance
anyway he made it really clear that i should not blame myself for anything and that if there was something i could do or change he would tell me
i have noticed this first when i started to experiment with cannabis it is given me anxiety so i do not do this much but cbd tincturesgummies will definitely do this
i promise you i want to feel and get better i want these feelings to stop but i feel so stuck and i can not get out
actually in my first year of college i made a few friends i was so happy i bloomed my suicidal thoughts were locked in a box in a corner of my brain we would hang out all the time one of them became my now boyfriend
we both were so happy and glued together for months he will we lived together most of the relationship it was perfect
with time things have gotten worse i have given myself time i have given myself so many chances why not give yourself another because i am done
she isolated me from my friends saying that i should form my own opinion and not rely on friends in that way but she would say i was too sensitive and would avoid conflict
it bothered me that my ex would often want to hang out with all of us at the same time instead of just me and him sometimes and just him and his friends sometimes
i do not know what i can do and should do all that has been going through my mind is i love my best friend and i do not want to lose them
not disregarding any of the tragedies of the pandemic of course this is just my personal experience i would not wish for it to happen again
i am currently 13 and my memory is kind of blurry but about half a year ago i was masturbating home alone and my dog came up to me
an interesting thing i noticed is that i treat him like he is my son his and his moms relationship is turbulent and abusive as well but from her side i feel like they are taking me away from my child when i have to go away to my home country i am completely dependent on him yes but i also am subconsciously making him dependent on me
it sucks especially since my mental health has significantly deteriorated i also do not want to talk to anyone about that since once again my friends hardly contact me and i do not want to seem annoying
i know this is embarassing and pathetic but whatever i do not care anymorei just broke up a couple of days ago and since then my life has been really strange
am i just another person to have lust messages with or am i someone you really love and want to be with what is it that you truly want what are your intentions
or you could give up and let me tell you something my friend giving up is the easy waywhy did you even start this yes this relationship that broke your heart and shattered your soul
everyone else felt like shit because of it but i felt like shit because i could not do anything about any of it
you just do not care how can you not fucking care i did not even seriously consider it and how we both have such different lives now
hearnow on all social media platforms how much he wants me back and wishes he could forgive me then nothing
so me n my so were never officially boyf or gf but we always acted like it so labels never mattered but he is gotten so much worse over the summer
i am never getting married anyways and i am not attracted to supermodels or whatever i think what people consider averagelooking women are still stunning
the next day everything was great and he told me he is in love with me excited and how he is not going anywhere
they gave me the freedom to choose where i wanted to go in highschool and then after that where i wanted to go in college they pay for it thankfully i am doing very well at college right now
i now had a laptop without a working k key and having purchased the laptop overseas it was not possible to repair it
i told her that considering how she presented the problems there was no way we could stay together i also did not want to stay in something that the minute before i thought was amazing and the second later it is not
i can not remember how is it like to be held lovingly i can not remember how it feels to have someone taking care of me when i am not well
the kids 16 amp 14 were happy until they told their mom she admitted to me that she was indeed doing so she had repeatedly lied to my face about it
especially male model types and actors and fitness coaches i leave really nasty comments on posts and videos featuring these kinds of men
beuh no i am just a fucking girl for fuck sake let me live i am sorry i was not allowed therapy or that i was not born the opposite sex i have to deal with this forever why mock me
whenever you feel lost and like you can not it anymoretake a step backand imagine it all disappear just for a little bit
if you are in my same situation or a similar one we can start chatting and became online friends just for have someone that listen to you and tell you something about him and make you feel special
i have found that when i do not take something so seriously or do not try to hard or force something i want in my life it somehow always works out
sorry guys i am really sorry i am so sorry i did not think we would end up like this i am sorry i let you down i tried ok i do not know what went wrong
well they tested me it turned out that i have covid and as a result was put into isolation first alone afterwards with another person
just got out of a 45 year relationship i will not go too much into the details but the way we met was pure fate i am talking like stuff that happens in the movies endgame type fate
as though there is not a worry in the world i am slowly approaching the end of memy girlfriend broke up with me a couple of days ago
and what the fuck is the point of this post probably my retarded attention whoring ass looking for pity i am simply pathetic
but on the other i question if it is fair to me to forgo voicing a want that i have but then i also wonder if this is even worth my time despite the feelings i have for him
this holiday season it is ok to avoid that family relative it is ok to get up for the second plate of food it is ok to not dress up it is ok to eat one plate of food it is okay to wear a mask it is ok to not show up to your aunt lisas this year please do not plummet your mental health bc of ur family or friends
she packed up laundry and was super excited to leave the house bye love i am going to do laundry then i will head off to work you can stay home
i am a kind person and only ever tried my best for him cared for him and loved him with all of me i lost myself in the process
it is like i get inside my own head i think oh i am feeling weird and it is all i can think about for months i freak myself out
please take care of you like i never got to before after all if he did not say anything about it then surely i could have done better
i feel like the only good days i have are when i am convinced we will find our back one day
i cried a lot you can add all the cries when i was a baby any cry during my 32 years not even close to what i cried during my time in the hospital
i went to my aunties for christmas got deadnamed misgendered and all i could think about the whole time was when my mother and father were yelling at me the night before christmas eve as i was crying in the corner on the kitchen floor cowering from my parents
if anybody wants an ear my inbox is open but the damage was already done she gave into lust and had an affair
most of the time i just want to die because everything feels so fucking hard everyone where i live is a religious fucking nut and i just hate it
i no longer find satisfaction in the things that help me relax instead i fantasize about you suffering i am scared i will actually pull the trigger not scared for me
the story of me and my ex is way too long to write here though so i will just cover the essentials we we are together for a long time onoff dating and a couple months after establishing a relationship she left me leaving me broken
i am 29 i met a girl she was very pretty she was very intelligent she was autistic kind of like me and i tried to be his friend at first because she is pretty to the level of it is impossible that she is single but i had to ask and she showed me a photo of her cats saying that is all i got so i felt like maybe there was a chance
i am going to try manifesting dying in my sleep since i clearly can not get the courage to do it any other way i never really believed in this stuff but i need to die like immediately
i get attached to easily and have got hurt in the past i find it hard to talk to females because scared of rejection
when she said it was over i did not beg for her back nor did i reach out i have a huge exam in the next 3 months and i just can not stop thinking about her
so to conclude it is both our fault more mine than hers though i think i was not able to keep her with me and make her happy
i asked if he and any of his exes meet each others again would he consider dating them even though they had mistreated him
for those who would ask i was there at his server but he told them he needed money and i told him to just work a job for a while he got mad and unadded me then blocked me and kicked me for saying that
turns out he is high right now asking me for drugs i stayed and will stay sober even if nobody is with me i will be with me if nobody keeps their word at least i will keep my word to myself
note it sucks that i can not reach out to my therapist because naturally she is with her family sorry for the tldr
is there any explanation for this anyone has been through something like thisbecause eventhough i am pretty sure i do not have an eating disorder i think what i do is not quite normal
the voice that whines and cries out for attention almost immediately i started to get worse from mild depression my condition became almost critical
i end up mailing it to her with a letter and at the end of the letter i put my new number down
the way i am i just want the inner turmoil to stop so i can finally be at peacei am in my late 20s and have had major depression for over a decade
i thought that if i proposed playing games to the group chat he would not play and he would get my hint ya know if i am there you should not be you can plan a different time i do not want him to not hang with our friends i am just not ready to hang out with him
he seemed a bit dumbfounded but said that i did not want to drive sometimes and little things like that i am like wtf ok
they opened her up and had tumors on top of tumors that killed her faster i tried to prevent her from getting pregnant because i did not want babies
then i was silent and he said he did not have time to stay on the call for hours and just hung up
now for the first time in my life i am going to be alone for christmas and i do not know what to do with my day
i thought my number was blocked on his phone and it was not so now i am freaking out i blocked his number again right after i sent it
this study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088being confined to it for the past 12 years i might lose my mind whatever is left of it
i know adoption is an option and i will likely go down that route but this this is something i cannot explain other than i am crazy
oh reddit is not a place for support fuck my familyin our moments together i really did thank god for placing you in mine and my daughters life
i am in therapy and have been on so many medications and being an ugly woman is literally something that is such a big deal
my earliest memories are my parents saying i was an accident and that they wish they never had me i was physically abused as a child
are you feeling sick with pain are you looking for literally anything to change how you feeli want you to get into the shower and end it with 30 seconds of cold
the movie talks about living life to the fullest and out purposes on earth and as someone who at times feels she does not have one this movie sent me spiraling
i respect the week pause and at the end he broke things off saying ti voglio bene which is a i love you for a friendrelativesibling not related to the romantic concept of love and that he does not love me anymore
whether it is people not liking me for no reason or because i legit panic and go into the deepest depression hole ever if i get too exhausted or
i go online and see he is been arrested he makes bond because he called his ex and he woke the house
that leads me why i am up making this post i watch a couple of videos look at some creepy websites with some weird stuff mostly things that are known to be fake and now i am unable to fall asleep i feel very anxious and paranoid
its made it hard for me to go out and work because i am delivering food to families or couples or groups of friends hanging out and it hurts
i think i was pretty decent about my insecurities then despite being uncomfortable and i continued to be really good about it for a good while afterwards
the reason i feel like i do not deserve to have this tattoo is if i am being honest i have not as hard as a time as other people have
my mother screaming while i was holding back sobs this is not about you this is about me your little sisters christmas look what you are doing you are scaring them she is the one screaming i am the one who tried to fucking open up to her for once
if he loves me and we are meant to be things will fall into place and he will come back to my arms but if they are not i trust my decisions lead me to where i am supposed to be
i can not pay my bills parents treat me like shit i like done fought with my bf because he helps finically it is not enough for me
it is so painful to think about all the crap i have been through in the last decade and how i could have had a different much warmer life with her and with a positive future could i have broken through my avoidance issues with her would i have been smart enough to realise what i had and not throw it away at another time
after all this time thinking about her and what happened between us and trying so damn hard to hate her and move on i think i have realized i still love her
at age 10 i started breaking pencils and started using it to hurt my wrists i also attempted to take a bunch of advil pills but i could not do it
when i try to read or do any fucking activity and even just doing nothing intrusive thoughts or words come and will not go away and it will be stuck on my mind but i do not say the thought out fully in my mind all the time but it just stays there on the back of my mind forcing itself to make me say it without me fighting and stopping it
then we met in person the next day she broke up with me notice the thoughts as they arrive not judging them not being carried away by them just noticing what arises
if you love and care for yourself you are not going to have an overwhelming need to do everything right correct or perfect the first time instead you are going to be more willing to fail because you understand that this is where actual growth comes from
_its imperative that you set standards for the way you want to live and be treated and respect those of others in turn
how can a person overcome this dark cloud specially at the moment everything seems fake people around me never seem to understand that loneliness or the feeling is real and its there but can not be explained and isolation is never a solution for this but it seems that isolation is always there silence has overdosed my brain and all i can think about is am i that alien to the world is there anyone out there who can break this black hole that is ben there almost 10 years now
but now it is comforting to know that i can go and leave this world that if i give it enough time nobody except family would even notice it is a strangely comforting feeling
why do i remain in a toxic situation or continue to hurt myself after a breakup i thought i would be at my happiest at this point but my life is on a pretty steep decline
for me i have been thinking recently i have a whole family clan ready to embrace me they love love and take care of each other meet up often and always keep in touch this is a network of over 20 adults in a 7 mile radius and then lots of children too led by a rich uncle there is only one major condition that is be a devout muslim or at least portray yourself as one
i do not want to make the people who care about me sad but i seem to do so even when i am here would it be so much worse when i am gone i feel like the world would be a better place without me
hi all you all i am looking for resources about coping and dealing with chronic loneliness issues i have been dealing with these feelings ever since i was ten so for like three decades now so i am interested in resources and real discussions about coping with or dealing with loneliness issues mitigation of the unhappy feelings and so on and building a good life and doing at least some flourishing despite loneliness
i wish my long ass face was beat so i can resize into a feminine face shape or even my previous face
i do not have any friends i have never had a meaningful relationship bf or gf because everyone grows tired of me after a while
being alone scares the f out of me now i have just been notified that i have been accused to academic misconduct in school
like our story is not over yet but i know i am just a fool i have been grieving ever since and i am asking you guys am i in the wrong here
it is been almost a year since my ex broke up with me i still think of him everyday we were together for almost 5 years we knew each others darkest secrets best passions and worst fears he made me better and i like to think i made him better
i called her as i was unsure as to how i could help and she described that she thought we were in some kind of matrixvideogame controlled by other entities
merry christmas i miss you everyday but you are the most missed on christmas you were the essence of our familys christmas spirit without you christmas will never feel magical again without you our family is broken i hope that you are the guardian angel of your great grandson you never met he would have loved you as much as i do have a heavenly christmas grandma
i patiently helped her get through her exams doing whatever i could do and supported her through them until she was on her short school break week
every morning i do not see your name on my phone hurts it all hurts i distanced myself from her as i felt really guilty about the whole thing
almost been a year already but that shit still hurts a million times can you give me advices i just wish someone wanted to hear me wanted to see me
every time someone comes into my life they stay a bit give me false hope and make me believe that i could be loved
anyway this is off topic and i am rambling but i wish i could still be a kid and have my parents protect me like they did
so i tried asking her if it would be okay if i hung up because i knew i was only going to yell about it and she kept saying no
i can not help but ask myself if she just came to resent me because i had constant health issues that i needed too much support i can not comprehend what is happened never in a million years did i think we would break up i do not know what to do i do not know how to be okay i still have one surgery after this and i can not even begin to prepare for that after all of this
i never had sex with this guy i did not like him one day you opened my phone while i was sleeping and you read everything
i have rising again and again and again and again and again and again but now i am done because they are gone they left you
i also moved to another state and while that helped with my seasonal depression i know nobody except my parents and my coworkers
and 1 more important thing stopped watched all videos about no contact will make shehe miss you and come back sign that shehe still love you how to get shehe back when shehe in a rebound relationship
it is just been nothing but work and suicidal thoughts daily every second i wish i saw something different in the mirror
hi first post here i and my ex broke up under two months ago after 2 years together we were also each others best friends and business partners so it was not easy but we managed to be amicable and friendly after a month all due to high mutual respects and the fact that we have a business together
a few weeks back i found out my bf of 5 years had been cheating on me it was the most horrible few days but we talked things out he was guilty and sorry he made changes stopped communicating with the other person gave me free access to everything to prove no more lies as far as i know it was a one time thing and he is completely faithful now
735httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat455s as a woman how can i bring up this conversation with a man in my life 930httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9uogs7qcqxat570s if it goes badly that is okay that is part of the process
idk much about that stuff but i have been told i am an empath idk i feel everything really strongly when i can feel
i still think about the butterflies i would get pulling into your drivewaypeople do not usually choose their partners to make children rationally nobody can choose what to love
is your fathermother cooking the food cleaning up doing the dishes trying to entertain everyone how about you step up and do a chore for them clean the dishes if you see some rubbish on the floor throw it in the garbage
should i keep going on or will i always sufferi always believed that i messed up with my life but today i got sure
it scares me and i can not stop crying about it i wish i knew how to talk to guys but i just always get so shy and awkward
i believe that i was often incredibly selfish in these friendships i would rarely ever consider another persons feelings and would just do anything that satisfied me in the moment deep down i could see the wrongdoing in this but perhaps my self hatred kept me doing it i have often felt regretful for that
and now after talking to her yesterday i feel depressed once again i was starting to feel better before she started talking to me again because i find out that she is happy with her bf and doing things that i thought we would be doing
i have seen the gp so many times have tried 5 different types of medication all prescribed and have seen 3 different therapists for an extended amount of time
we broke up 3 months ago to be fair we were both miserable we fought all the time argued like a married old couple and did not spend much quality time together but i still loved him and wanted to be with him
i stay in the hospital 17 days and during that time i have a mini surgery where they place a gtube on the side of my stomach
i also slammed my head so hard i can not hear very well from my right ear right now i think this may be a minor panic attack right now
i am trying my best to give everything i can give back but damn it hurts when you are struggling so hard seeking comfort from your closest one only to be pushed away
i need to be better i need to learn more and i will be a software engineer one day and my future self can look at the note i am writing today and be proud of myself that i am not worthless and untalented as my parent used to say
keep giving day by day and the universe will have a plan for you in life just like it has a plan for me
i would go days at a time without texting her to give the space she wanted but she would never hit me up
she really ended it this time i barely have any way to socialize with anyone i have never felt this alone in my life
our bedroom has pictures of us on the wall what sucks is i bought an engagement ring and i was going to propose this week
i been battling this feeling of loneliness even when surrounded by people for a long long while now i had the standard up and downs but i can not seem to move past this down hill feeling
after writing crying deleting and trying again i am really just posting to say i am grateful to be able toi have been in bed since 2pm on christmas eve and finally up at 10pm tonight christmas day
quarantine time i realize i do not have people to talk to a close friend to call and that i spend all of my time gaming because i have nothing better to do even tho i get bored
i have come to the conclusion that no one wants someone with autism aspergers and multiple other mental problems like myself i am so broken that i can not fix myself and honestly do not think i can deal with this life anymore
i do gym at home every day tried online dating and did meet a good amount of girls recently also had sex a couple of times but i did not look for it and honestly i am almost asexual in this last period i was more looking for a connection with someone planned some small trips i try to take every small occasion i get but honestly
all i feel is this whole fucking shit ton of sadness while he is actually happy with someone else i do not even know what went wrong and what i could have done better
i also have mental health concerns not suicidal or homicidal thoughts i need to get treated stemming largely from this situation including being terrified of mental hospitals securitypolice officers restraint and having my possessions taken against my will
it does not feel like that long ago but this morning i woke up and thought man i really just do not want her in my camera roll
we met in 2017 that years at the end of it i was going to move to another city for college but i fell in love with her and decided to stay just for her now i understand why people make stupid decisions when they are in love
but you cut me off every single time we talked these last couple of days you did not fucking care about me
from then i could not help but blame myself and my grades dropped too i started feeling lonely in my own relationship because i was so emotionally upset
i understand they are busy but sometimes it feels like i am always too understanding i no longer talk with most of my previouslyclose friends ever since we all went off to uni
this mindset stays with me everything i do is not enough for even myself whenever i am happy with something it is only temporarily every art i draw becomes flawed every sentence i write makes less sense is my existence even enough
it is not that i am ugly i could find another girlfriend easily but i decided not to fake to be someone else than my real me like i did for all my life and i think people do not like who i am on the inside
i have not really had any struggles in life besides being bullied and i see people going about their day just fine i know i am weak generally speaking i just feel like life in general is pointless and i am basically just running out the clock until it is my time
ps not seeking for advice not a regular lifes a bitch to me and i want to die post life was and will be always be a bitch to me the past haunts me i see no bright future either interested people can talk to me on dms people who want to say good things for the karma in the comments and make no efforts to connect connect and ghost me save your words
i am just a horrible person if you look at it from my view what is even worse or better is that nobody notices how i evil i can be
her parents are assholes and do not take her seriously so it is not possible to have a paid therapy and counseling sessions
we started working on this in april and have gained a lot of momentum our coaches are awesome and we have done a lot of live events as well
i remember when i was around 10 11 and i wrote on 5 index cards about the unfamiliar feelings i had that i know now to be depression and anxiety
i did not want to come home in the first way due to covid and feeling like shit however i have spent 90 of this year alone and was able to travel under guidance before it all changed and i was allowed to purely for the fact i did not really want to spend my christmas all alone especially when i already feel so low
she has done this before so to avoid her doing that her mother blocks the door from her and her dad holds her back bc it is 12am
i had my phone on me and i was texting my friends trying to just get some reassurance they knew my fear
does anyone else wish they could just stop existing like i am not sad or anything i have a lot going for me i just would not mind not living anymore being eternally alone is that weird
i feel left out and i know for a fact that nobodyis there for me because nobody cares i just feel so fucking alone and i only feel real at 3am while crying
it is like you hired a car and it broke but you still have your own car if you bought something together and that broke you still have your own version of it
we were hanging out and i ended up sleeping over nothing happened but i woke up in the middle of the night and had this moment and went through his texts on his phone
i wonder what are the consequences of isolation having no friends but you socialize with family members of a young individual 20ish years old
fuck him i am going to check out of my failure and shame miserable cunt can you please give me advice concerning my case
he always pretended i was not crying or would get maddefensive and then i ended up feeling like i had to hide my emotions because they were never okay i always expressed myself but showing feelings was not safe
i have experienced what life is i get it it is not for me and i have had enough i do not want it i have not wanted it in 5 years and nothing has changed
i still was at the top but not the first at the end i slowly stopped caring about ithave any of you ever taken that leap and moved away did you find life improved
to sum things up she started dating someone else 2 months ago and already told him she loves him but is still as recent as today posting really upsetting things about me on social media that are not true and has been doing it since the break up
lately i have been singing to myself in my head this nina simone song do not let me be misunderstoodbut i am just a soul whose intentions are good
am i being weird i do not understand myself to be honest because i am entirely sure it is like my instinct knows it already
last year on christmas i was finally starting to get better i was lucky to have met hera year later she has now cut ties with me and i am back to wanting to kill myself
i am not very good at planning but i am trying to be better anyway i have been back in town for almost a year and i have not made any friends
i learned social skills to a really decent degree and saw myself warmly welcomed to social scenarios such as going for a smoke dinner bar every now and then a party every now and then
recently these problems have grown to include my social life because i have realised i am incappable of sending a message to anyone i know without feeling like i am annoying or innterupting
why do i want to kill myself well i just can not live with myself i can not even describe how much i loathe everything about me my looks my personality it is like i am my own enemy it is so weird i feel good when i hurt myself intentionally like i am punishing myself and showing that i have the power to do so
if i did not have family and friends waiting for me if the pandemic ends i would probably kill myself now i recognize that i am very mentally ill but of course getting help has been made difficult too
i am 41 the last time i have had a friend was 20 years ago the thing is when i really look back to those days when i had friends they were drug users i was a drug user they were criminals i was a criminal
i would do anything to go back i know a lot of people would disagree my mental health had never been better although i do not think isolation is the best coping mechanism
i became this unhappy angry she will of a man who was constantly having a breakdown i was childish and dramatic and now feel extremely embarrassed and i cringe looking back
i miss her so much and i want her back so badlyeven though it has been like 25 monthsbut it will never happen and that is super sad
i want tired of being just an spectator of his life so yesterday he broke my computer and most of my things including a photo of my mother
now they are planing to get together after quarantinei know i have a bad english i am practicing i am sorry about that
but then you guys know that did not happen and i thought it was right to return her money back to her so i did so today
i do not really know what i am asking for here but i just feel so lost i feel like i will never truly get over this one
she said she does not feel like being close to them i found out she has trust issues bec she is also not that close to some of her friends
it is christmas and someone i really liked just fucking removed me on everything on christmas eve for no fucking reason my family is having a party i got drunk on christmas eve because i was severely depressed and now i have a hung over on christmas
my apologies if it is vague i do not quite have the mental energy to go into detail right nowbut i feel like a shit person
ok i know that sounds crazy as fuck but i need serious help with it religion has absolutely cursed my mind and i need an escape so i can see my brother again
it does not break you it builds you up when you recognise that you do not want to hide these wounds or hide these challenges
i can not look for help myself i can not afford it so it feels like the only solution hes met my family the only guy i have ever let meet my family
i can not stand this loneliness anymore if i can not sort this situation i will get depression would not entertain other girls at all
it is just i feel really sad and i just want to sit and cry honestly and i feel like i am taking so much more time than usual
talked so poorly to myself because i lost you and could never forgive myself for the mistakes i made but i understand better now
the only time i spend tome with people my age 20 i know they do not want me there i always try to put on a happy face but inside there is a well of nothingness
how much i love you and miss youtoo late to try now since everybodys found their own circles and i do not fit in any of them
she replies every 67 hours and sometimes she does reply multiple times in an hour everything i never wanted to be it worries me
it gets better though in gradeschool i was abused my lovely aunt and grandmother buried it because i do not know reasons this escalated my behavioral issues in school and at home immensely rage does not even begin to describe it
i was a child being touched by the men my family let into our homes and no one listened to me
i noticed lately that on most days i get really hyper and jumpy for like 13 hours and then come down and get really tired and depressed for an hour or 2
over the last few weeks i have been drinking every single day because i honestly just cannot stand being sober days that i try not to drink i have constant anxiety and work myself up to the point of a severe panic attack i have had to start drinking earlier and earlier to get a handle on my anxiety each day and now i am at the point of adding booze into my coffee each morning
i just stood there like a deer in highlights now my anxiety is through the freaking roof i am almost 30 still live in my parents in law apartment because i am just stupid
he is says is not that a bit draconian i say i can not pretend to talk to you like nothing is wrong and i just went to sleep feeling weirdly calm
literally do not feel like this around anyone else i am the youngest and it feels like they all look down on me
and you are all you need to live life beautifully it is been just over three weeks since we officially broke up
i know she was missing her family especially with covid19 and the difficulty to travel but i was telling her that it will be better next year and she would be able to see them again soon
some of you may know my background story if you do not well here it is dude i have tried for years and years i can never be in a job for more than a month
why are people lazy prcks path of least resistance maybe honestly more than anything i just want someone to be there for me when i do feel this way
i thought i would be okay i thought i was starting to move on but i am not ready to look at you yet
i have my sons for the first time in a few years for christmas eve and she was so excited to be a part of our christmas
even a magical lamp only grants three wishes anything tangible anything material might make ones life easy or save one some time
we never had sex or anything but i was lying to him i like him and that one day we would have sex
please note that i never judged or blamed him for it he is going through a hard time and i know it is not his intention to hurt anyone
i do not really know where to go for help this year was originally regardlessof covid going well until a few months ago
that he was trying to get attention from other girls only to push away those remaining feelings he had for me

3 relationships i have close friendships navigate the dating world without much difficulty etc4 activities i have hobbies that i enjoy and also do volunteer work
she was the opposite she was very sexual open person saw most of sex as just entertainment and was very experienced
i slowly convinced her not to fall asleep and she gave me her grandmothers phone number i called and explained everything
and since i had the time to disassociate from you and your face enough already since you were cold and it hurt because of some past trauma things i am not attached to the selfies i still have of you but i do not want to rush my healing
i am an 18year old student who graduated high school last august last friday the school year started again so i went to university in my country after high school we go to university or to a professional school after 6 years there i finally managed to make a few friends in the last two years and those were the best years of that period
do you think my bf will regret some day or no cuz even if we breakup i still care if all my effort in this relationship deserved or no
he asked me to come to his apartment and i did we talked and he said he wants to work things out
that she will end it with him after quarantine because it would be easier as he will get a new job
i am lucky enough to have a place with my grandmother for now but after that who knows i am angry that no one in my life caught this or ever talked to me about it
i am missing my life with my ex i keep dreaming of her and would like to rekindle that flame i just do not know how to do it should i just call off of work a random day and get her to come somewhere with me and we spend time together idk thugs is hard to deal with
the scariest part is not knowing if i will see you again if it is just easy for you to move on with life without me in it
i am basically by myself anymore i work i sleep and repeat this on the daily now i will add that these people walked out because of the colossal asshole that i was
1identify the references fueling your limiting beliefs aka the evidence that tells you if a belief is true or not
i do not know what is happening i am upset i feel alone and i do not want to burden people with my constant crying bc i feel like nobody would want to deal with me
i asked why bec i never felt that when i was with them she did not explain further she said maybe i am a bit arrogant or something
i keep feeling like i am letting everyone i know down because i can not get a job in my industry field and i just lost my christmas retail job because of tier 4 lockdown restrictions in the uk
i did not believe in anything anymore5 years and i 25 broke up last night it was out of nowhere or so i thought
oh yeah i forgot to make a relatively important clarification i am 18 years old at least i turned in august and at the time of history i am still 17 and i have no idea what a nightmare life will turn into later
or if i should just not say anything and just end the friendship by not replying any advice received would be helpful
i also find it very hard to share a bed with someone else and really hate it when people touch me or want to cuddle

me and my now ex gf first gf i ever had broke up a couple weeks ago there is no bad blood or anything it was all because it did not feel right to me or whatever
the thoughts i once resolved in my head that would come back a few minutes later are 90 diminished i forgot how it felt to feel like this i forgot it was even possible
i had to ask him to stop talking when he told me he had fallen out of love with me because i could not handle that reality
heartbreak does not break you i want you to remember that write it down and repeat that to yourself because i want you to be so aware of that
no one in real life or any other really cares even when i am about to end my life i remember my friend telling me that he is unlikable and everyone hates him and no one wants to talk to him that fucking bitch people like talking to him he has friends at least one close one i know that for a fact
i know that it feels like it expends a lot of energy to shower but i promise you it will feel worth it as soon as you turn it on it only makes you feel worse when you are not handling your basic hygiene i hope this post gave you all some motivation as well
i am quite wary of the possibility that i would reach levels of hopelessness where i would just kill myself on the spot if i were to go through that again
if i do fail it i have to take a year off of school and i would have to tell my parents everything and lose my successful athletic career
after years and angry words were exchanged she packed her shit and moved out we tried to keep it civil but she becomes defensive when i point things out to her today she gave me a ride to get gato the dog cat in spanish some food we got i to an argument and she left me there when i went inside
i know the pain it would because for my family her family and my kids but i feel that i am not the best thing for anybody
i had only one good friend but she left me for others i am in highschool right now i can not give my kids a proper christmas
somehow and somewhere on the internet i found out that the answer to my gaming inconsistency problem is that i had a lack of confidence and right after finding this i got to work on this lack of confidence i had but this is what made my actual problems 10x worse for me in the future
my life on the other hand has just shrunk since it all happened i have very few friends anymore though luckily the ones i have are very solid and although i have finally found a job again i still have not started working yet and i feel so trapped
with me i have never treated her like she was my pet one day she blocked my number i could not get in contact with her
most online articles suggest having regular social contact with friends and family during the pandemic does anyone know of any resources or articles for people who do not always have those options who might be single with few friends or a lot of acquaintances and willing to make some friends virtually preferably interactively if you need any clarifications i will edit
i do not think i am alone in life it just feels that way to me i know i am unhappy with myself and i do not think i ever will be happy with myself again
and is not by any means the same to experience it with an actual physical person than online not to diminish the contribution of online people but it is very ethereal and invisible in comparison
maybe someone would be interested in my story so i would share with herhim what happened but i do not want to annoy or bother anyone
all i wanted for christmas was to die but as you see it did not happeni have adhd and maladaptive daydreaming i feel i may have more but no one listens to me
imagine that you saw a poor man on the street that needs help and because you really wanted to help him you went forward with pure intentions and gave him a hand suddenly he gets a knife out and stabs you in your chest the closest to your heart takes everything on you and runs away
the type of loneliness that can not be solved by anythingthe type of loneliness that can only exist in those who are truly alone
my social anxietys getting worse and i am too scared to tell my parents about it and i feel like i am not doing enough work and studying and stuff but i can not actually get into doing it
it is just during the end of last year and beginning of this year he is been extremely cold we do not have dinner together and do not speak much
so today is the day before and he is been distant he will not talk to me about pretty much anything he is been talking about how he no longer wants to live and honestly i have no idea what to do
we share things and have deep conversations she accepts me for who i am and stands in my corner when the world is against me
i need advice on what to say and what to do i am balling my eyes out at the thought of losing him
before when i asked him why did not he block me he said he cares for me and he would eventually message me
even though he says that i am not sure if he would still want to be my friend but i really just want to remain good friends
we did not speak until october and i forgot i knew her password to snapchat first time i ever signed into her social media i saw another guy in her snapchat obviously her new boyfriend
i used to be happy all the time and feeling good about my life but now all i think about is how i do not have someone that likes me in that way anymore
at the beginning of october i started talking to a boy we would ft literally 247 he treated me better than anyone ever has
not that i want to stick around in this hellhole i did not go through with my plan out of pure laziness and slight numbness i have not planned on living this long so i have no clue what to do now
i hate myself beyond belief and i am tired of it it happened before to him i am a little bit far from human natures
please help me i have asked a psychiatrist but he says without the patient a diagnosis is not possiblei have ocd and i suffer badly from intrusive thoughts
hey so this year has been a crazy one for me personally i got sober i got my dream job i moved in with my girlfriend we adopted a beautiful cat and a dog then i lost that dream job covid man
why am i wasting my youth on this shit why am i doing anything anymore actually why am i still here i have already fucked up beyond repair may as well be dead
i realized she spent the last 3 months figuring why them we should not be together but not telling me just keeping things going
middle school was a tough one i still was at the top but not the first i have never had that and i do not think i ever willeveryday i wonder how people look at my loneliness
what difference would it make if i was dead whatthis is probably not that serious of a problem sorry i just needed to get that out
it may sound selfish but i have already had a shitty ass year and before i felt like turning 14 monday would be a huge accomplishment because i have dealt with so much pain this year
your ex was just a flawed person like you with their own fair share of problems shitty qualities and lousy beliefs or values
it is his right not to forgive me but i feel so betrayed and it is so unfair that i did not have the choice to not forgive him either if i knew back then that he was involved with another girl behind my back i wasted 5 years of my life with a person who gave no fuck about me i feel devastated and hopeless i do not know how to handle the situation i feel sick
i told her on two separate occasions that i wanted to distance myself from her the first one i told her that i wanted to distance myself from her as much as i
this relationship was the best thing of my life it changed me forever and her friends are currently also my best friends and the people i love more
reading has even started to become an issue because i scan the words with my eyes but become fixated on something halfway down the page and it turns into me just blankly staring at the page instead of reading the words
i have got a friend ik him irl and online but i am worried he always says that he does not want a gf and wants to focus on his future which is totally fine but all he ever seems to enjoy is playing a particular game and maybe hanging out with friends on very small occasion idk he just does not seem to enjoy much at all
christmas is often a period where some can feel extremely lonely or emotional if anyone is feeling desparate or scared please tell me i have nothing to do this christmas so we can chat all night long until you feel better
now it feels like there is kind of nothing in my life i just feel a hole with no one to talk to
i am aware of one of the roots of my inner turmoil short lifelone emotional physical and for 6years sexual abuse by my older brother when i was little parents were oblivious bc i was a serious stockholm syndrome case and protected my brother about every bruise etc me forgiving him years later for everything bc tired of hating him him throwing it in my face and pretty much literally breaking my heart
in fact i do not really want to she was the one who initiated the breakup but deep down i almost hope she does not wish me a merry christmas i have distracted myself with friends
he has not contacted me for 2 weeks hes talking to other girls and partying while i have been a sobbing mess for weeks
my father my sister and brothers constantly involved us in their problems since the beginning of our relationship and my father actually really played us out against each other but since the beginning my girlfriend and i made an agreement that as soon as they leave or hang up the phone we would let it go and focus on ourself on our time together
in some cases i have a hard time brushing it off so i may be quieter more withdrawn not wearing the happiest face etc
but i do not know how to change his mind except give him space i have sent him a lovely text and said that i need this time and we can speak next monday

i feel like i could walk out the door into a busy intersection and not care a bit i have lost the ability to care
i am afraid to be sexual again feel like i can live because my brain health is so poor i want to my brain to get to normal levels so i can feel like ok again
part of me wishes there were a reason for me to keep going but there really is not i have realized that i am at a dead end in my life and there is not any way to fix it because the problem is with something that is unchangeable suicide is my only option
i am not doing too great in my studies but that is not my main issue cuz i know i can fix it
she cried and told me that she is sorry that she can not return my love but that she wants to stay friends
and the way things are looking this is pretty final and hes not coming back he wants to move on from me and the pain of losing our girl
betting on it to take care of all your love life challenges bring your ex back or fix your partners compatibility is wasted hope
during this whole time i have been extremely sick and it has only gotten worse college seems unlikely and i will never make friends i just want to die
the older i get the worse life seems to get with no signs of ever getting bettercould someone please help me categorise if this is any kind of health issue or normal human behaviour
i walk around a zombie scared to buy food not knowing when my last dollar will run dry and it is makes me reallly fucking crazy because i am a lucky one
she does not know how much it hurts she does not know what it feels to be in my shoes i cannot sleep at night because i keep on thinking
hey sorry for the long read i need to get this out i broke up with my ex in june 2019
i wanted to really cherish the little things with her and i felt like that did not get to happen things were going super well her friends and family liked me and her and i would call every night
i do not really know what to do to uplift my feelings right now i guess i am just hoping to get my seizure and stop breathing
tonight my ex chose someone else over me againi do not know what i am looking for any advice would be appreciated thanks and sorry for english
and this is just the right now situations no matter what is going on i find some reason to hate it or feel bad about it
i just want to know what i could possibly have what disorder or illness so that i can look for tips online to manage and keep it together until i get professional help
i do not get it i22m was with this girl20f for over 2 years we broke up she met someone else in less than a month and they are still together here i am 1 year later getting rejected left and right barely over her
i do not want them to feel or go thru anything but if i feel like this would not it be better if i stopped
i courted her for 4 months during those phase she will suddenly withdraw told me that it would not work that is why she wants to end it as early as possible
if it was not for my friends and family i honestly think i would not be here now they supported and loved me when i was completely hopeless before i believed that i could not life without her love but now i know that her love was not good enough for me with the help of therapy i have been trying to better myself and find ways to be happy without leaning on a relationship
i am wandering if i am the only person who has not been happy for one single day of their entire existence21years to be exact swear i am not exaggerating wish i was though
even so i moved out at 18yo to study and i always wanted to live in a big city so i stayed
i love him so much and we always were like a family for each other now he refuses every demonstration of care and attention it has been a week
like a few minutes before making this i was legit like starting to tear up and wanting to kill myself cuz i am so fucking mentally exhausted with everyone in my family
its like i am made of two separate entities one who has the impossible task of keeping me alive and the other who is completely and totally unresponsive
i am done can not be bothered anymore i have not found any purpose yet and after what is about to be 7 years of suicidal thoughts and impulses i have just given up
my background and race often confused people or even pushed them away i started to change my accent and often suppressed my true feelings and self
in the beginning of our relationship he was a little abusive he would throw things at me twist my arm bite me spit on me and belittle me when he wanted his way
about 3 months into this i tell j about my situation and she is decently understanding she was upset for a couple days but we moved past it
my dad is more religious and my mom is not as much but she is from india my parents do not drink or do anything
there is also a pack of ibuprofen in my room incase i want something extrait is ok if this gets ignored just needed to pour my heart out
i was honestly nothing when she met me and she changed me to be someone i am proud of and i lost her
i am tired i am tired of longing for friendship that clearly people are willing to giveit is been 6 months since she officially ended it
i ended up taking 10 of my strong prescription sleeping pills and drinking about 20 standard drinks within the space of a few hours
so the door can not be completely closed he says he is not ready for a relationship but we all know that means
when it was good that is you were so shitty to me i am often unmotivated to do chores and can not when my sister needs quiet
i just want to know whether there are others who have faced similar situations or not and also i would like to make some new friends so feel free to message me
you may start to have thoughts like i must have done something wrong maybe they do not like me anymore i am not a priority for them and so on
i asked for prosperity and god gave me brawn and brain to work i asked for courage and god gave me dangers to overcome
heaven forbid i take his german shepherd whose improperly trainedsocialized out and dog breaks free of collarattacks someone or another dog
and just did it right then and there some pics hurt more than others but i did it and the fight ended with her the care taker leaving the house she never returned after that
for drinks at the pub i am working so i can not be there i still did not give up and almost lost my mind
i no longer cried as i could no longer release a single tear my mind since then has been like a well overflowing with negative emotions
it was closed because it was christmas so the beach was totally empty of visitors in order to go inside one has to pay normally
that night i decided i would try and not contact her but it did not last very long as maybe a few days later i had to contact her and we have been in contact ever since
i did not go out and meet them as much and they felt more like school friends people to hang out with a school so i was not alone
i told her that we needed to break up she cried saying she did not expect me to want to break up but she understood
i was diaappointed the last time when she had rejected me because she ticked the right boxes for me but since we had hardly spoken and only met 23 times it did not take long before i could clear my head
i wish i could say i do not have contact with him but i am the one that cannot let him go
it is also crazy bc i used toam so into personal finance and funding my retirement accountwhether alive or not i am not sure yet but i fully intend to disappear soon
4 i can not function as an adult i can not go to doctor alone without my mother because i do not answer properly or do not ask questions which are required at that time and when i come home dozens of questions pop at that time
we have both agreed several times that i just cannot live with her funny enough she has never allowed me to find a job or even try for my drivers permit
it feels like wherever i go people really like to talk to me but already have a friend group so i am just a friendly stranger and a nice conversation
is it my fault could i of done more should it of gone this far i am going absolutely insane and i do not know how much more my mind can take when will it be over
she also threw my dog once and accused me of hurting her in front of my sister my stepfather punched the wall next to my head once and threw a lot of things to intimidate me
i can not love my body anymore my family and friends all hate her so it makes this decision even harder for me
really hope i can pull through and keep going but just do not know if i can this time anyone else having a hard time with the holidays
the ones you murdered but know they could be easily revivedi know they are not our safest memories they are still intact and very much alive
with that said i am back to a state of neutrality and gratitudei m just got out of the most serious relationship m i have been in this past wednesday
we were friends before i started dating so my ex knew about our close friendship and also knew he is gay
what do i do to feel better on my own and not depend on people too much i know it does not seem like much but it is been driving me insane
i do not have the luxary of being able to go to regular therapy and i am just terrified of spending all of that money for it not to help
another example is after being a hardcore communist atheist she now is a hardcore prevatican 2 catholic where she thinks that the current pope is evil
if you require any more information please email me at 1511019chesteracukmailto1511019chesteracuk i felt calm i felt like i could be myself
i grew up a loner watching people became a habit often wondered what it was like to have a group that cares and what not
do not let however you feel right now be the end all because everyone gets lonely at a certain part of their life everyone is strong and will get stronger with these experiences
so i recently moved to a new house so i could go to college i am still in the same country but i was raised in an island of that country and i am now living in the main land
i also can go from laughing and joking to staring out the window and wanting to be alone this affects all parts of my life but it hits my relationship the hardest
in viking culture they say the reward of honorable death in battle is valhalla a strange warrior version of heaven and eternal victory
one minute later he replies to my text saying that he was good too and he was glad i am good even though i spent 2 days replying to his text because i was not sure if i wanted to break no contact
i have shit i want to talk about you have shit you want to talk about if you want hit me i have no judgment to pass around
i am trying to hold back tears and tell myself that i do not want to be left on read ever again by someone who does not deserve me
take pride in giving up on the relationship it is wrong when people say that never give upgiving up at the right time and right moment is very importantdo not water a dead flowertbh the cactus
i have been recovering in the peace of my own apartment 500 miles away from my hometown for the past six months but i have to go up for a week for the holidays starting tomorrow
i just feel like it is a matter of time before it happens i guess it worries me sometimes how comfortable i have become with that notion
well i do but i can not do so without feeling so fucking bad my girlfriend has been struggling recently and all i want to do is help
please help me i do not know what i am supposed to do or how i should manage this anger i am three steps past breaking point and i do not think i can control my anger
in the end he said he does not love me anymore and blocked me but he unblocked blocked unblock and then i blocked so he can not anymore
and i was very confident that i would make it right now i am back on track again by the way eating healthy and working out 6 times per week
i am from europe so tool does not come here often around that time they played at some festiwal i even bought the ticket and had it in my hands but since they were playing at the other side of the country my parents would not let me go at such young age
i tried everything before ending it vacations showering with gifts thoughtful ideas and communication nothing worked so i decided it was time to move on with my life
i understand that this is her own fault and that it happens but she just got charged with a felony for having quite the amount of thc
i love so many people i have loved and i have lost but at the same time i feel as though no one understands what i am going through
they are also really my only real life friends there was a big falling out a few years back and it essentially cut us off from all the people we knew back in high school and left just the three of us alone
by the time i had quit that game i must have used that training room for a thousand hours trying to find the reason behind these inconsistencies which is why this stupid feeling in my head has gotten such a strong hold on me and everything i do
fear isolation where an individual is either too distrustful of others to form deep bonds or pushes others away because they do not trust themselves not to hurt others
promised me all the time that he would treat me better than my exes if i would give him a chance
like i said i have done things i regret and my mind just amplifies it times ten and just replays scenes i can not really get the thought that i might be a bad human out of my head even thought you know i have never done any thing truly wrong at least that is what i want to believe
during those two years she held on to me for a long time sending me texts and calls in hopes of getting me back as she was very sorry for what she did and it agonizes her that she had put me through that pain from what she tells me
december always seems to be so dark despite the lights on every street corner and as families gather to celebrate i am once again reminded of my loneliness
my friends try make me go to sleep i appreciate them caring about my wellbeing but for some reason it still feels like some form of abandonment when they tell me to get some sleep
so i met someone who i connected with like i have never before and the feelings for him were so fucking strong
has anyone been through something similar and how can i try and feel better i can not even make myself feel mad at him i just miss him
it is like you get so used to not having to compromise or think about others your default is just do it as you feel more kicks in
i want to end it all life provides no respitefor instance i can not travel to be with my family this year so i will do a zoom call
which to be honest makes me hate myself even more i am so much worse than people that have it much tougher in life fucking godspeed to them i will just be over here making the paperwork so i finally can own a pistol to shoot myself with
edit sorry my wording is all rambling and off its my first post and a lot has been on my mind and just keeps going on and on and sorry if the title comes off as offensive i should have worded it to is my dad mentally ill or something
i do not know i feel like i am just trying to deflect blame in the end it is my fault i lived my life this way and this is where it got me
i thought of your piano playing today and how beautiful it was life is strange but that does not need saying of course it is
i do not have any friends that i could consider more than acquaintances i am really good at base levels of friendships and things like small talk and from the outside you would think i am friends with loads of people but i have not actually hung out with someone new in a long time i spend every moment on my own
i decided to give him a second chance because he promised me literally the world and he seemed really changed but guess what he cheated again
i can not really tell anybody about this all now i do not want my parents to worry even more and i do not want to start sobbing before my 11yo little brother or the half stranger i eat lunch with
in my next post i will give you a live example of the my own progress she left me 49 days ago so not that long ago and yes it does get better
but when you began to talk about the cat of your new girlfriend i felt like a fish that only got fresh air
although i think the main thing about this that is the most irritating is that i do not know if i ever even really wanted a girlfriend because when i think about why i am i want a girlfriend the first thing that pops into my head is because i do not want to be looked at as a weirdo or an outcast and not because i love the person that is my girlfriend
you look down at yourself and you know something is missing remember when you used to wake up and feel happy because you are going to call the love of your life to say that one good morning
it is nearly midnight and i feel like maybe my emotions are just heightened but it seems like not even my close friends want to hang out with me anymore
sometimes i have weekslong episodes where i feel incredibly selfconscious and no one can possibly make me feel good about my body
this year has been such an eye opener i have finally left my toxic family and have found the longer i stay away from my mother the more memories of abuse and hurt and so much pain is coming to the surface so many emotions that i am having a really hard time processing i just needed to get that out thanks for listening
i do not do being alone so well what is worse i have a mother who refuses to even check up on me and i am chronically sick if i had a daughter like me i would constantly check on her i am hurt i am angry i feel i have no place in this society
he realized he liked it better at home countryside than in the city i have a ft job and he was working pt and was still in school
so any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent even something innocent like i hope you find peace is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a persons sense that they are unwelcome in the world it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded
waking up going through the day going to bed not in yours anymore is all a struggle not seeing you call or text me during the day and when i talk to you our feelings are different for each other now
to him i am just a spoiled entitled brat that can never measure uplove will find you my friend just tell me
now in december i have episodes happen for nearly a 3rd of the month i think whatever super natural force if there is one behind it is finally telling me to just finish this business no point in beating it around the bush that would screw my family though who have sacrificed so much for me
then i say i want us to talk like the good ole days she says well we more just keep in touch
even precovid it is crazy how years go by and the friends you once knew are not by you anymore friends move out of state and go their own path i still have some friends from college but even they feel out of reach i am only 25 and i feel like it will get worse from here on out
some examples of this would be that i can not think of what my mother looks like i can not think of her voice in my head
i am not able to book an appointments or see anyone at the moment because of the pandemic and i am not sure if googling things would give me quite a good answer
i know i sound abit possessive and clingy maybe even obsessive but that man was my true love i loved him like no other
few weeks ago she sent me a text and said she hates me and started to message a lot of weird shit and i did not understand her and at the end she said she hates me and just said goodbye
today i had a very rough day and all i wanted to do was talk to him i wanted to call him and cry and hear him tell me everything would be fine
i gave it my best shot but its time to call it the hardest part is the guilt of leaving the ones i got left behind
it just never goes away i go through the motions of life but i am losing all hope there is no magic in life things just keep getting worse people that i want never want me guys always end up treating me badly and i get so hurt by it
the past few years have been rocky moving to a new city starting life over having to move out suddenly change my life again which was all unexpected
last thing i will say christmas was kind of depressing it ended so quickly i wish it snowed here how was your christmas
spoiler alert she was actually a complete asshole and generally the human equivalent of getting taint rugburn let us call her n
you were this bright light that showed me the way through the darkness like this big gold star and for some bizarre reason you chose to let me love you
i know i can not drink like this every day but it is the only thing that helps at this point and i do not know what else to do to keep myself going
i am really in love with her and still hope to be together with her someday but we are in different phases of life and are very different people i guess
i did not want to lose him so we decided on just friends we never even actually dated it went on for years the cycle of abuse neglect
it only hurts more thinking about the fact that our anniversary was a week or two ago she seemed to happy and loving but i guess she is a good faker
one day i asked him just in case if we were exclusive expecting yes of course and he answered well not really
a kiss and cuddling and sexual tension with two different guys 3 times in total in a space of 3 weeks with the same guy
looking to hear how i am this that or anotheryou guys do not know me but i am sure you would like to see a descent into madness
to make a long and embarrassing story short i stopped by a public motorcycle meetupshow on a whim and got goaded into an hourslong onesided conversation with a woman a few years older than me she got drunk and started groping my ass after the meetup winded down i decided i wanted none of that and left
any advice outside of the oversaid try clubs put yourself out there new hobby etc trust mei read somewhere that having pcos does not just mean infertility problems
he helped me pack my stuff he hugged me and cried with me he said that i can still text him
i am sure a lot of people can relate to lonliness because by covid19 but i have been living like this for a long time
i know my situation is a lot better than others and i am lucky to have food and a warm house etc
aside from loneliness i have nothing to be sad about and despite it all i am and when there is no real because
then when i was about 1314 and started having anxiety and depression it caused my relationship with my mother to plummet
is it normal to be posessive and obsessive about your favourite person when i get problems with my favourite person it is like my world is shattering and everything loses meaning and it does not even have to be a romantic relationship
she said she needed time in order to understand why she was feeling weird about it and said it was nothing that i did
there is no blanket cure for loneliness but once you have let yourself have enough paininduced catharsis things will get better if you can just make yourself try acknowledging your own situation is the first and most difficult step happiness takes effort and things may never be perfect but they will get better it is never too late to start anew and put hope into the future
later i fucking regretted it because i got super suicidal still am and was so close to shooting myself but this thought came to me like what if i go to hell listen idk if heaven and hell are real but i have been scared of hell since i was a kid
i broke up with my ex in june 2019 our relationship was codependent and very much not healthy i think they would put me in inpatient treatment for a very long time and i can not handle that
i have been on this sub for maybe a month now and i am trying my best to help the people with the stuff i keep telling myself but my life is just getting worse and worse and what i tell people is feeling like lying to them i just want a nice life but every death in my family more bad grades and my denied applications piling up just feels like the end of all of my chances i have in this life
how long do you think i should wait until i get in contact with her again do you think she will end up missing me and wanting me back as she may have made a rash decision
we talked every day and i saw him a few times when the pandemic allowed i was endlessly happythey are not that best friend that love that soulmate who i lost
but a few years ago my family decided to move to the countryside because my dad ran for office his family was originally from this province and won while i stayed in the city because of classes and just because i thought my whole life was rooted there
sorry guys this will be long one but i simply had to get this out somewherewe are in our mid 20s and were together for 8
whenever i have these experiences it is always just thoughts i rarely panic because of outside forces i think i panic because i feel a lack of control in my own thoughts i am afraid of being deluded or narcissistic i am afraid of being blind to things about myself it often causes these experiences it often leads me to not want to express my emotions because i feel i do not deserve to
i could not stop crying and i just wanted to be held and told that i am loved and that everything will be okay
she knew i would hide things from her and i would become cold distant and angry when she wanted to talk about it
you could say it is like my brain underclocks itself if you are computer savvy all i can do is whatever is the easiest thing to do at the moment
my parents were both loving and present and emotionally available and i never had to worry about having enough food or clothing or anything like that
after i came out to him a few weeks later he was the only person to respect me and still is he would casually call me them in front of his brothers and on phone calls
i am oblivious and anxious whenever i go outsideand the worst part is i genuinely enjoy self harmand i really just want to die
lost a lot of connections this year and i am finding it hard to ignore the itch to reach out to them but also feeling anxious of any possible confrontation that might happen
and that is ok because i am doing ok i hope you are too he ended up coming over and we had sex
we both agreed that we did not want that much distance between us it was hard enough not to be able to see him every weekend
i bought the game 4 months ago and i already have 240 hours and it is so hard to stop playing at first i would play only once a day for hour now i play for 4 hours it is gotten to a point where i am kind of bored of the game but it always makes me go back
we are here to offer support not judgement that means accepting with the best understanding we can offer whatever emotions people express
it is been quite a somber year overall and christmas kind of served as a reminder of all the shit that had happened throughout the year

if you need to vent it out i am heremutual breakup with ex dated for about four years and it is been 4 months since we have spoken
i can not tell my family because they will think i am crazy and saying it for attention i am just really scared and so lost
there are so many possibilities in this world and what you can do is be open to that love yourself if you find that no one else can
yesterday i finally had the courage to remove our relationship status on facebook a few minutes later i saw he unfollowed me on all social media
but the other half of me knows it is wrong and that i broke up for a reason he is not the man i want to marry so what is the point of going back when i know it will not last
i ended up cutting off all my friends i did tell them what happened tho to deal with things on my own
understandably i was in a withdrawn and not energetic mood once is hostile behavior towards me started however he was able to switch from a not okay mood to a let us have fun mood and this was just irritating
i was getting a bit of a short fused due to everything going on and she was getting very frustrated with me too as of late
i did not know that being nice meant calling me your lover staying up till 3am on facetime calling me to fall asleep to my voice blowing me kisses on the phone
i could sell my soul to devil for my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blanc to become real but she will not agree to follow me into the hell after my death only my one she is immortal and the longest ever imaginable entire life with her will not be even approximately one single smallest bit enough for me
a part of me will always love you i can never hate you but i am thankful for you for helping me realize that i am valuable and capable of doing anything i want
all the mantras like it will get better with time things will improve feel so obnoxious and untruebut i have my own flaw too
i felt like i was doing things that helped her be happy and helped her stay on top of her depression
i spammed and flooded him with long messages about how i feel and how i am fixing things he kept saying he just needs space
ever sense that day i could not sleep i keep having psychotic brake downs had to get some medication i can not keep a job to long and more and more nightmares that keep me up at night
not even sure i still accepted it i just knew that there was no way i was going to convince her not to leave
would get frustrated and impatient if i was not ready at the door to leave at the same time as him would regularly delegate when i should get ready while he sits until he thinks it is appropriate to get up
i sat and cried over the next few days really having opened that old wound side note i truly believe in her word
i am sorry for the odd way of writing this tet but all the words in the english language can not say what i try to say
should i kill myself is that what i deserve or should i try to give my life new meaning with something like volunteer work or do i just turn my back to my past self as long as i can and continue to live this lie
i realize that probably noone will read this colossus but i just want to leave something behind i want to be the person you come home to every night
i express wanting to stay friends still because that what we originally said we would dostupid right yeah i know cut to 2 weeks into our supposed staying friends relationship and she fully admits to now be sleeping with they guy
waking up from a nightmare in the middle of the night thinkingwhen am i going to to sleep tight like normal people do
we met last december and ended up having to live together through lock down which probably did not help the situation but for the most part it was a very healthy relationship thst coped very well under the strains of the global situation
is it insightful no it is not insightful because it is not helpful it is not inspiringi found this extract from quora which enforces this decision to get into the sea
from a sporty guy i have been working in the office sometimes 1314 hoursday only sunday off and got a lot of weight
with respect to maslows hierarchy of needs i am minded to focus on donating to the local food bank however i am more worried about the mental health of the other members of my community the local social security office is quite generous with its food stamps people are getting enough to eat they are wellfed but they are depressed i can see it in their eyes they are hurting i have no idea what to do
i am dating this guy for what is now a bit over 6 months we spent every day of covid together and summer and in general were just best friends
i tell my girlfriend i love her and want to spend the rest of my life with her but when i get in a mood where i feel like i want to be alone and not with her anymore she questions if i am just lying to her when i say i love her
just sad and full of hopelessness life is different now i am different i am afraid of dying i am also afraid of trying
back to the breakup she moved away for university and we were really wanting things to work out and they did for a while but it obviously did not last
my situation is humiliating and pathetic and unfortunately it took me some time to recognize the severity of the situation because everything was not clear until i became sane again
we were with three in a groupchat at the time me the abusive friend i knew irl and another online friend i very deeply care about
my sexuality was off the walls i gained a porn addiction very quickly and am still far far from getting anywhere close to beating it
and then boom i stare at the wall all day longseriously though i understand loneliness does not care if you are surrounded or not
what is funny is that i try even though i can only talk to you in place where i can not say much
before the brakeup we last each other in march due to corona virus and i felt that she became more and more distant during the quarantine
it is an old crush i thought that my thing for him was dead because of my relationship with my ex but we have been talking more these days because of some mutual interests and although there is no romantic movement in anyway from any of the sides i am happy i have a crush
my head is so spacey or whatever that it is really hard to finish thoughts sometimes i do not know if that is just a normal thing that happens to everyone and i am just being dramatic or if that is something that i should be concerned about
she said sometimes you have to let love go for a time for it to come back even better than before but i just do not see how any of this is healthy for her or for our potential future
i want to die i see no reason for livingi have a lot of reasons for being happybut i am not i want deep happiness but i can not find itthis world is not place for happy life
i had to rehome him and it is been killing me i miss him like hell and even thinking of him makes me cry which makes me feel so stupid
definitely do not have any respect for me the love is there i guess but they make me feel like such a damn outsider

she told me she had social anxiety and had depression signs of selfharm on her arms but she was doing better i am quite a mentally strong individual so i did not mind i felt like i made her happy she made me happy so i did not see why i should have ended it between us
i have had hints of depression in the past but all related or tied to my anxiety i feel like the wellbutrin has sent me spiraling into what seems like a possible mixed episode
this is a weird feeling for me to be experiencing i am a very happy personthere are probably many other little things that happened within the course of 7 months but eventually everything ended
i just want to live in my dream for everi have been suicidal almost 20 years now for my entire adolescence and adult life i have tried
fifth i put efforts on their behalf too never let them pay never let them walk never let them strain themselves for me so when they had to put efforts for me it was bothering them and it was easier for them to walk away than put effort to make it work
i did not expect him to want a relationship but i guess i had hope since we still hooked up and i know typically that is not the type to entertain an ex

i do not want to be anywhere or do anything or see anyone or eat or smell i feel like i have lost my home

even though i am praying to all the existing and nonexisting gods and saints for them to have mercy on me and make my dear beloved sweet little angelic berry blanc real while swearing by everything i have and love and care for on the bible

i imagined that you loved me so much that you wanted good things for me that you care about me and you wanted me to be closer to god now was all those requirements from your parents or were those your requirements hidden under your parents names
r if you are reading this i just want to say that i love you if we are meant to be things will subsequently work out and we will meet again
the truth is our family gave us everything growing up never hit us or abused us i even agreed to an open relationship but it turns out i can not deal with that option

all the things i wanted to kill myself to avoid happening have happened all the pain and suffering i wanted to avoid by killing myself has happened
the fear of incest came after i watched an incest video while watching porn and got turned on by it but not by the incest itself

i have trouble motivating myself to care about college because it does not get me any further in my friendshiprelationship with him
i have been trying to be better to myself i have been trying to stop my habits of checking in on all his socials so i decided to delete him from everything except messenger

we are staying best friends and staying a large part of each others lives and have talked about the possibility of trying again one day and i am grateful for that
if you talk cool if not that is just status quo we started calling each other mommy and daddy ironically at first but then it became our thing
especially since now all my friends and my mom know what horrible things he said to me everyone would be so disappointed in me
the cycle of abuse neglect up until abandonmenti am terrified that i will go crazy without friends and become something that i have feared the most
for a while now i have been having these urges the best way i can describe them are the equivalent of a 5 on the emmengard suicide scalehttpsemmengardcom20190507suicidescale but i am not experiencing any suicidal ideation
so i breaked up with my former fictional husband and i am remarying that is painful enuogh but what do you guys do on a lonley bday i do not have freinds and i juts feel empty
i am the kind of person that is loyal till the very last momenti could solve the problem of securing a high end awesome job
and as someone who is extremely lonely and miserable like many here i suppose i wonder if it comes mostly from me panicking about that
i went crazy i wanted to die so bad and i hated myself because i know it was all my fault
i want me to do better i had dreams of playing in concerts writing novels etc but i have been struggling to just stay alive
i carry a knife so when i have a tough time i can give me that edge i just fucking hate life and myself
i am not worth anything i do not add anything to this world i am just fucking trash i just want to rest i do not want this fucking voice screaming in my head
i was back in the room i began in my family was so scared they thought they would lose me forever
i fuck everything up for everyone i hope some of you have more help than i have and you can push through this
i am sorry to everyone i hurt in the past due to my ignorant ways i am sorry to the girl i loved for not being a good enough person
most of my time i just look at the ceiling in my rooms or my hands i am oblivious and anxious whenever i go outside
it is even worse when you convince yourself through others that what you are is not right on the outside i try to put on a metaphorical mask and act like a text book person
i hate that she is making me feel like this even after she is gone and the fact that she does not even care
choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone is trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible
i also need to figure out some way to let go of a lifetime of conditioning that i am doing poorly this has both made me unhappy and enormously damaged by self esteem
i really do not know how i will handle the discussion tomorrow i feel like it is the last time of my life i will see her as much as i would like to show her how i change and tell her that i think we deserve another chance even thought she will not come back on her decision
i firmly believe she is my soul mate and she is my best friend and we have agreed to give each other another go in the future but right now she is not able to do so because she is going through a tough situation with her family some sort of estrangement and one of her grandparents recently passed away
he would forever think i was weak and selfish which i am far from both i do not even know what i am asking
but it is not that simple we hardly wanted to spend time with each other we wanted different things out of life we argued every other day over stupid shit do i wish things could have not been this way of course
i stayed and never thought once that it was something that would have affected our relationship sometimes being haunted by those he was forced to make a split decision in killing for any guys in the military i am sure you can relate
absolute cold or is it untapped rage or sadnessall i can think of is the girl i have a crush on
then she told me that she wanted to break up with me it was because she did not feel emotionally stable and also pressures from the church and religion
i apologized and told him that a lot has been going on and that i can not make it this week either which was true but that i wanted to check up on him
and that in a time where i was battling my returned suicidallity alcoholism and a pill addiction i actually thought i could trust her to be understanding and caring
my then psychiatric team did not see the need in testing me for it despite broaching the topic even after they knew that whatever followup testing i was supposed to get in child psych i could not receive because i was hospitalized shortly after i started treatment
the reason he broke up with me was because we have been together for 3 12 years together 17 20 years old and he wants us to experiment with other people so that we can be sure that we are made for each other he kept repeating that he hoped we would meet again one day
i will take any and all jazz i can get but because of miscommunication and mostly my stupidity i have hurt her greatly
he never wants to me intimate and no matter what we are discussing he always finds a way to start talking about his video games
sucks being a loner as an adult i need people to talk to let alone have friends no one cares been like this on and off since i started college so 4 years ago

she threw away our relationship for a fantasy the other man crafted and now she was trying to rationalize her decisions
the funny thing is it was me who told the care taker that my family were talking about her and she left
i was on honour every year and never failed a class i was highly motivated to do well get good grades do my homework etc
i cannot live my life away from all types of toxic intakes and when it comes to love i am just as chained
eating pizza feels like holding a gun to my head at night i lie in bed crying because i ate food
had a great day with friends but i kept thinking about her and now that i am home she is all i can think about
sometimes people are meant to come into your life but not permanently you can think that they are going to be there forever but you will never know until that day come
and she tried to sabotage it again and again now i will be her friend because that is what she wants me to be apparently
i have gone from a small town where i know a lot of people to a big city where i know no one
this started roughly during a really stressful relationship with someone diagnosed with ocd and being abused by their parents i decided to leave the relationship and they attempted suicide
in the beginning of january 2020 i decided to give psychiatry and therapy a try i was in a very dark place for many years i am 22 years old and have not been happy since i was in elementary school
for some reason i feel more confident now i am noticing myself saying what i think more taking more risks trying to socialize and it is paying off i am re conecting with old friends that have been a blessing in my life
now that i have the text here looking at it i suppose the only reason i have not is i am not convinced the damn thing would actually kill me the way this shitfuck of a year has gone i would survive and be wheelchair bound or more mentally damaged than i already am there is always the shotgun i supposebut it does not have the same sense of poetic irony to it
things went too fast he was so sweet and so eager to be with me just fyi he is suffering from depression and anxiety
because if life is about people coming to my life destroying everything and never face a real consecuence pain or even guilt i can not
i wish i did not have these commitments i wish i could just give upi dunno how to explain but i just can not fathom why i am here
he is moved on and stuck in this hole of despair with no bright spot on the horizoni love her still but it is like i am scared of letting go
a bunch of small negatives some reminders regarding you came up i handled them alright in the moment
so yeah i regret being with my ex because all of the above were things i stopped doing when i was with him i did these things before him and after him he was the one dragging me down as such for the first time in my life i legitimately view one of my exes as a waste of time
i am completely sure that i can not go on for another day sitting in my room and just think about ending all my problems
i remember that i read somewhere that death by drowning is mainly painful due to the fact that people panic while drowning
dating has also been difficult due to time restraints and dating apps usually end up not being very genuine i never pay for premiummaybe i should i just hate feeling like my life is passing me by while all my friends get married and in relationships i have had girlfriends in the past but for some reason i am having so much trouble meeting someone on my wavelength educated with career goals
i even started talking to my ex gf sometimes we have hang out alone but i wanted more i wanted her back
the guy hugging the woman and comforting her something i needed from my ex i did not get it and i can not imagine having a child with him
real problems require real drastic changes i am so sick of being sad but the truth is you do not find the same person twice
music is my whole life and always was thanks to my father i will be always thankful for that no matter how bad our relations are now so i wanted to study to become a journalist
but at the end of the day i when i am home again by myself i just sulk back down to my old depressing self and still feel like the world is against me i have no idea why maybe it is because my friends all have their own social life and they all have their special ones they call their own and i feel envious or jealous of them they have other friends that they get to hang out with and i am just one of those people but to me they are my everything
i used to struggle with substance abuse but since covid i have developed an awful online gambling problem i do not want to be here anymore but i do not want to hurt my friends and family
people in my town died in the attacks our next door neighbor worked on a high floor of the south tower and almost definitely would have died had he not happened to take a vacation that week
i am always deeply unhappy i will not go into the particulars that is not what this is about and i would like very much to do something about this
i have not had a dream or aspiration in my life i feel like i do not have anything that i am good at

been seeing a shrink for a few months but to no avail he said that i might have bpd but not for sure
not really sure how to start this i have never been much of a writer it was a fairly bew relationship but it still hurt
this is obviously an issue at home as my wife while very understanding can not do it all i feel i have hit a wall
i just wish life did not exist in a way i wish all humans could go at the same time and none of it ever existed all the saved years of suffering and pain
i am sorry i have not even properly read the info for this sub just spilt my guts a little there i apologised thinking i ruined a pair of friends catching up and left

i have attached a file down below to my full 120 page breakup recovery manual to help you get over your ex and rebuild your life as fast as possible
my last therapist was not the best1 month ago she messaged me and she wanted to try againand of course i accepted it
every night before i go to bed i have awful anxiety attacks which are usually followed by flashbacks and ending with depressive and intrusive thoughts
if i went with one of my online friends i am scared they would fine out and be mad other stuff people my age do like party i can not even do because of how strict they are
i am back at college but i really miss quarantine and how much happier i was i would do anything to go back i know a lot of people would disagree
so anyway i was indoctrinated into this belief system and only found my way out earlier this yearor if you already overcame it what was the solution
i am at my core not great at communicating because of this i blew up what we had instead of talking through it
everyone says i mean so much and shit now when i look back no ones lefti have been talking to two different people recently
i am currently on medication for it just wondering if anyone could give me some words of advice on how to cope with this
i want to be held and feel like everythings going to be alrighti want my fucking brain to fix it is fucking self
so as you have guessed i have been broken up with me 24f and my boyfriend 25m had been together for two years and today he ended things i am heartbroken and while we would been going through a rough patch who has not thanks to covid it came out of the blue for me
how do people do this how do people live their lives day in and day out i am so lonely and sad none of this seems worth it i have family and one good friend but i feel so alone even around them i found comfort in having a partner that wanted to share everything she understood me and made me feel safe
this study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088loneliness is likely going to stay with me forever
i obsess over a specific memory and create scenarios in my head where i told the person exactly what i would have wanted to tell them if i could go back in time
train your mind to recognise that this break up was for your good you dodged a bullet i do not want to be sad anymore my dad knows what she is like but he does not change anything
the only thing that is stopping me from crying is that i do not want my family to see me unhappy when they all seem so full of joy
i answer people here and support them 100 and only get angry with obvious trolls or stupid fucks like the one who had commented earlier
he seemed happy with that idea and kept saying how he still loved me and missed me and that he would let me know when he could do it
my coworkers from both of my jobs have become very busy with their own lives my best friends are abroad my friends from back home have all moved to their own colleges my mom and i are barely even talking my dad can not understand my mental health and be supportive about it the therapists at my college are garbage and have hurt more of my friends than they have helped
and i see like his looking at me with smile but i read in fear hes eyes like fcking demon stop it pleaaase
she could have met me in person because she comes to my city like 5 times a year and she only lives like 2 hours away
i do not know how to find people that will not hurt me i flat out just do not know how to find people
that would make zzzzs birthday way more complicated than they already are i might write a few more letters but this will be the inly one that reaches you i promise
i might just be obsessive and crazy i was just especially lonely tonight and was curious if anyone felt this way about someone else
i am so grateful for this group i suffer from feeling alone all the time why is it so easy to feel alone when there is so many people in the room
i am kind of socially awkward and could not make meaningful connections with people since childhood i have no friends currently and i live away from my family
i am so single that i went on a cliff and yelled i love youu and the echo yelled back i just want to be friends
you may have rationalized this in your head as being best for the both of us and you are not wrong
i love him so much and i just can not process ithe has not spoken to me since outside of work that is he has no choice there
lately loneliness for me has been like having bone cancer because i feel it all through my body no one to talk to for hours makes me want to give up on this earth life
i battled depression for 5 years and found myself getting better but due to my depression it costed me alot of loses
i 23f have always struggled with my mental health i remember when i was i was very anxious but was just called shy it got really bad when i was around 14 worse at 18 then slightly better for a while and then for the past two years it has been getting progressively worse
i have managed to build some relationships but it is so hard and something always goes wrong anxiety does not help either and any little thing can make me feel terrible for days which makes interactions really hard sometimes i just want to live in my own world forever which does not sound so bad but when i feel well i am tempted to let people see it too
unfortunately the pain will not go away as fast as you wish it tobut you should not tell yourself it will never end
considering my experiences in relationships and spending 10 years avoiding relationships before i commited to one with you this should speak volumes to you
think of the stages of grief as fluid you shift between each one multiple times throughout your recovery journey typically you will cycle backandforth through the stages several times until you finally release the attachment you formed towards your ex and move on gracefully
so how do i just stop considering it and just move on it is driving me insane having this option and that i have to pick now
if they care they should care now not then later if i am going to kill myself they going to say why thati did not give signals
i also feel bad and useless because i can not do small things like having fun with the family i just do not know what to do i feel like whenever i open up to my family about my feelings they just ignore it and continue on like nothing happened
i thought i understood and she is tried to tell me why she made her decision but i still do not get it
and well that opportunity came and he is moving 10 hours away from me we both agreed that we did not want that much distance between us
its only gotten worse by the day i tried getting a hobby like painting drawing or photography but i am just simply so bad at it
i have been trying so hard to get my shit together but i just feel overwhelmed and cry i have followed every productivity tip in the book every bit of advice
i am 21m and i live alone in my own flat and for me it is like every day is just repeating over and over again i go to work and do my shift and then go home do the same the next day
i am not part of their group i get the most done and am so considerate of their work load they like how i work but they do not think about me
for some context i usually have them in the middle of the night when no one is awake and i just suffer for at least an hour until i become exhausted and fall asleep or throw up
he said something along the lines of the person you had a relationship with and built in your mind is not real
now i am approaching 30 and i have nothing and nobody i can not even enjoy the only thing that basically repacled human relathionships for me and helped me cope music
but i hate the feeling that he does not care about me anymore or that he is not struggling i have moved on in some ways
today she told meit is not fair to be in a relationship right now because you clearly have feelings for me that are not mutual we are better off as friends i am not comfortable with this but you are the most important person in my life and i do not know what to do without you
are these the symptoms of a panic attack specifically the coughing or something elsehow do i know that i checked my website statistics
idk if i am just using any and all excuses or just super on guard with my heart tia for any guidance
i know it was the right decision the relationship was toxic he was not a bad guy but we had wildly different communication styles and fought constantly we spent the past two years fighting hard for our relationship working on it working on ourselves having long hard conversations that lasted well into the early hours of the morning
i barely turned 18 and i want to fucking diesuicidal thoughts when i was younger where more manageable now they are not
i do not belong to happy people when all i want is to go back to my lake and drown so i run back and swim to the bottom and hide again
i am really scared of what i am going to do to myself soon my mental healths getting alot worse and so is my self harm and i am just so unsure of what to do
after work i do not have that happy love to run to i try very hard to be okay but i am not
last night i dropped a card and baked goods at my friends house while he was at his parents the plan was to visit but it was the only time i could go when i write cards to people i always write messages to them because it feels a lot more meaningful than just signing a card and its usually pretty cheesy
i was a burden to my parents i was fat and lazy and i was poor of character the only thing i deserve is to suffer and die
i know you said this is a pause and maybe one day we can get back together after we have matured but i can not handle to think that way
i put the blade near my wrist whilst i was still crying and shaking uncontrollably million thoughts still ran through my mind
it must be so nice to not be a minority in the us it is lifelong and i do not know what to do besides death
i am tired that i do not trust anyone i am tired that i have a bunch of cognitive distortions and not being able even to thank people for something i am tired of being lonely all the time and building all the plans on my own and then fall into overthinking
i feel bad receiving things because no matter how much i like it i know i will not be able to enjoy it for very long
i am angry i want to be angry but i do not have anything or anyone to be angry at she is so kind and awesome she was so sweet to me when she broke up with me and i can not be angry at somebody for just trying to find happiness in life but still
i was truly making the changes i needed to be better stopped smoking weed and stopped engaging in the addictive porn behaviors
like high school was understandable i was bullied there and when i was not being bullied i was alone with no one
some other friends saw we were on and joined too but they had not seen the show so we stopped talking about it
i plan on running away at night and jumping off a bridge only things left to do are finish writing the letters and maybe seeing a friend or two for the last time
as a kid i was told by the news and my doctor i was going to die young from my weight
it fucking hurts to first feel like two people fighting inside me with the the winner being able to take over my body
i feel like i am dyingi do not really feel like talking to anyone it also feels like people do not want to talk to me
i am from latin america any mental health disorders are considered weaknesses specially if you are a male like me you are considered a crybaby looking for help is tough you will be judged right away
when we saw each other in june she told me that she was thinking alot and that she wants to end the relationship
what do i do i feel lost and afraid of what is to come i used to have an idea of what i wanted in life but covid had thrown a wrench in my life as well as everybody elses
they also disappear when something positive happens in their lives they seemingly only want to communicate when something bad is happening in their lives or mine
from a place of complete lack of the will to maintain myself i can not be bothered he also suffers from mental health issues and seemed to be very insecure in relationships
so i want to both support my friend through a rough time but i am worried that if i let myself rely on them it will end up sending a wrong message i do not intend
he makes my life so much harder and every time i come home and everything of mine is torn to shit even if i was gone only 30 mins and there is shit and piss everywhere i am reminded why i can not stand my home
i met a girl whom i have fallen in love with i had a somewhat decent job still shit but better than the ones i had before still was too broke to afford seeing them live when they visited europe before the release and there were real signs on the sky that tool is going to release a new album
i hope that girl finally realises what she has done to me and learns a lessoni hope my friends realise that i was not seeking attention and learn a lesson
i came to like 5 minutes later and went to lay down i continued to fade in and out for about 30 minutes and then i fell asleep
by 24 my brother went back to prison while our mother ended up passing away i felt like i was left abandoned in this world
i have no drive no dreams or goals no passion i have been stuck in a rut for years i have nothing left going for me
then in october he went drinking with some friends and ended up with severe covid in the last 5 years of my life i have managed to read 3 books
i have been trying to wait until the end of the year and see if things kept getting better and i can move outback to the city i was happiest in but honestly i am not even looking forward to that anymore
i love my dog and my family and my friends i do not have to worry about food insecurity or whether i can make my mortgage payment this month
i am friendly i meet people each day at work then i go home to my she will tucked away behind closed doors just praying wishing hoping i can be the next body to bury
i remember he sent me some video that had a title similar to you and your best friend in twenty years and i was like oh my god best friend really
i have no life beyond still no friends just acquaintances per se no relationships made been single my entire life without a single significant experience
the tiny shred of hope i would been hanging on to is gone and i am ready to finally free myself from my mind and this world
what if we get back together i keep reminding myself all the couples i know that have broken up but ended up back together
somehow the last time someone texted me without asking for help on something was ages ago hyperbolethat is how it feel ever since i have became a nonstatusposter on whatsapp
their sound in your memories is as live as it gets you see them with vintage scratches and slowmotion you remember
i just can not help but feel like i should talk with her about how if maybe if we tried things slower and i give her more room that it would work
there was a lack of balance in the relationship no engaging conversation or challengeinput in decisionmaking from him and a lack of ambition selfmotivation which i have come to realise i value in a partner
i have a ft job and he was working pt and was still in school i never had an issue with him being in school and working pt
sending love to anyone who finds this if you feel as lonely as i do then at least we know we are not alone 3
any guidance is appreciated i feel like i can not speak to anybody about this because to reiterate i feel like i am so persistently annoying to everybody
which is good of course i am not entitled to a reply but it is draininghe threw me out just for some misunderstandings
but then he just coldly hugged me said thank you and that is it this was our last meeting her older brother used her on multiple occasions to get what he wanted at great expense to her
i reached out to three people in hope for a virtual cup of coffee in hope for 10 minutes of their time to talk about everyday things
so the holidays have been roughi am17 stuck in the house with my mom because of coronai can not do drugsdrink without her finding out so i have resorted to cutting myself when i am too stressedsad need the release idk what else to call itit does not really satisfy me like being blacked out does and having visible scars is less than ideal sinceonce they let us out it will get in the way of my other main coping mechanismcasual sex
thursday my mom forces me to get a hair cut ryzi is still a bit jittery but shinanother alter keeps it under control
do not ever come to my fucking house again do not ever fucking call me or text mealmost been a year already but that shit still hurts a million times can you give me advices
then there came a time he started keeping stuff from me stuff that definitely would have hurt me the day i found out that was the end of it
i hate my life and i hate how useless i am with peopleis this too much to ask i just want love from them and them to be real
i wanted to ran away and never look back but i know that is going to be even worse being homeless is one thing but being homeless in south africa is a different story
yes love can make your life richer in so many ways but for me at least i am stuck in a situation where for 9 months my boyfriend had been pretty much the only person i have been in contact with somehow we are still deeply in love but at a certain point we just do not have anything else to say to each other and we start to be two lonely people together
so to all the people with hallucinations out there how do you all distract yourselves do you have comfort items or music films etc that help you cope
but the feeling makes it clear that i am straight i hear it is incessant call on my flesh and wants of having a familyi hear it
my dad soon moved out of singapore and we started to distance i had a helper who helped pick me up from school and kept me company
in a way i envy my little sister who is so ignorant to the world where she can be happy and recieve so much love that i never got
i was 15 at the time and my dad was not answering and the more he called and did not answer the angrier my uncle got
do not get me wrong he was a wonderful bf a bit controlling but not enough that i needed to change myself and we dated for over 2 years we were each other first real loves we broke up because long distance is not an option and he is going to the other side of the country i can not move with him because there is nothing i can do with what you wanted to
after one hour i left on instagram i opened up to him i want out but i feel guilty but i do not understand why
when i zone i do have fake conversations in my head with people i know and am close too or like celebrities but i know that these are fake and i feel like these are common because everyone lives in a perfect world in their head mental illness or not
my family never made me feel accepted and safe my mother insults and threatens me most of the time that she will physically hurt me she keeps holding it over my head that she is the one feeding me and that one day i have to give her my money i just feel so alone in life no friends no boyfriend and a family where i feel like my opinions and choices do not matter
if it were not for that coincidence i would have raped her far worse than i already have i was literally inches away from inserting it
every morning when i wake up i feel like giving up one day she blocked my number i could not get in contact with her i end up changing my number
i see a lot of posts from people with social anxiety or depression and i have been labeled these terms by others in my life as well
why do people always say exes always come backhave i had exes come back absolutely have i had exes breadcrumb me absolutely
i do amazing during the work day present really professionally go above and beyond prove fantastic results and then i come home and am in a terrible drained mentalhealthexhausted mood
my whole life i always had to be the person to start the talking asking to hang out etc i am just a distant memory for most i feel this intense sense of loneliness
i want him to see that i blocked him bc i moved on from him and he does not matter to me anymore but that is not how i really feel
hey i do not mean to spread bad vibes or anything but i have found the following ted talk to be pretty interesting
i had this feeling for a long time and i had this one point in my life recently where i wanted to live for myself but now it just feels dark again and i am feeling like i am worried how hurt my family would be if i died
everyday i remember the people i met on everyone is favourite app kik and remember that they were the only pwople that could make me feel loved even though i knew they just wanted my body
recently something bad happened that was my fault potentially life changing for my life only and i started regretting everything this year
so i hope i have found the right sub reddit and i do not accidentally insult anyone by my mannerslack of knowledge i do not have any diagnosed mental health issues
i miss having a friend group having a meaning for my day to day it sounds dumb to say out loud but i think i latched onto this girl from work
i did this to myself but i can not help but think of our first kiss laying under the stars on a hill talking about our deepest secrets
i know i sound like the asshole here but i truly love him i still do it is just during the end of last year and beginning of this year he is been extremely cold
my self esteem basically does not exist originally i thought it was just a trauma response to having been hit by a car several months ago
brothers against brothers sisters against sisters and family against family by this point in my rant i do not feel like saying anymore
i am not over a girl i used to date in high school i mean i do not want her back but i still have some love in my heart with her name written on it i tried using anonymous chat apps like omegle chaterpilar and other such things to distract me when i am thinking about her but she always pops into my head when i am running
i just posted about how even though i have a new pet which had come with the cage and food and our daughter also has a new pet they have not bonded which is ok since daughter is taking hers back to rochester ny with her on the 30th i feel empty
i want a medical diagnosis but i can not do anything to do with needing an adult i want to know what is wrong with me this is a pretty unexplained paragraph but please help
at times i think this is the only way to feel connected to understand people and their struggles i want to keep things on good terms
since i have stoped looking at what i think i should be and i just focus on the now and growing naturally as time goes on i feel genuinely good and mostly happy for the first time in my life
but alas it is over and i do not have any finals exams no more online lessons no more sitting in the background while listening to others it has all become quiet
so my question is can i be mean and really say what i mean i want to say that i regret being with her and that i was not happy in that relationship
i asked him to tone it down but it did not really change any of her behavior so less than a year into us being official he decided to cut off contact with her for my sake
she also said part of her healing is me not starting to date another person so i feel like i can not go on any dating apps to at least make friends or occupy my time with some talking to people can not see friends much in corona so i am feeling really lonely i do not know what i want from this i just wanted to rant i guess and see if anyone had anything to say
to my ex i broke up with you twice and you do not want me now i hurt you i know that he is not going to wish me for my birthday he stopped talking to me forever
not only that but recently i had an accident and there is something wrong with my back it takes me 10 minutes to go to the toilet and it hurts like hell
as a result of this i am doctor diagnosed me with mdd and since then i have been in my room a lot more often
the thing is i know my thinking is warped i know that i am projecting my own low selfworth onto other people
i went to the cabinet and took 3 sleep gel pills which probably will not do anything to me what should i do until i can get help
covid came and forget about getting employed maybe you valued loyalty and honesty and your ex did not maybe you wanted kids and they did not
i want to tell you how sorry i am how much i love you and miss you but i know i am just a fool
and honestly i have thought all of this already so maybe she is right and she is just saying what everyone else thinks that i am a parasite who only sucks everyone dry so what even is the point of sticking around
it can not be pms as i finished my period just a couple days ago but if postmenstrual syndrome is a thing i guess that is possible
i want to kill myself so bad but i know i have changed i am not the person i have been in the past but at the same time i can not run from it i have escaped the consequences for now but who knows when it will catch up to me
i want to go back to july when we were still in love because that is the person i fell in love with i fell in love with the girl who made time for me and made me feel loved not the person who constantly leaves and makes me feel unworthy of anything more than 3 texts every two weeks
which at that time i was putting every effort into helping her conquer it but at that moment i felt as if my entire heart shattered
during the day we caught some minor mistakes here and there which happens when you first start somewhere but after the day ends and i go home and go to bed i suddenly wake up at 4am to check my email and get one from my boss saying there is alot of mistakes with alot of transactions and i am absolutely freaking out
i do not have any friends left nobody wants to be with me or even talk to me and i keep getting more and more anxious
honestly i have been dealing with lots of issues even before the pandemic most of the time i had to do them on my own depression anxiety ptsd and even loneliness
sometimes they do not even reply me and last few weeks they barely reply to my goodbye you can imagine how worrying is this to me
although it had only been 2 months since the breakup i was actually feeling quite healed with the intense introspection and reflection i had put myself throughi did have my good days and bad days but mostly good these days these days memories of us were no longer was making me happy or sad i was in a state of neutrality and that was when i decided to send an eletter to my ex
i am pushed away like a bug like i am some disgusting creature he had just parked his car to take out his groceries like a normal person
like internal voices constantly talk and arguing over my conscious mind causing me to argue with myself and blurt inner thoughts out and build up a pool of anxiety within me i am sure we all experience this from time to time

it has been more than 3 months after our breakup and i blocked him on everything to let him think that what he had said did not hurt me at all

i am in very good shape still somehow never figured out how or why though but i was arrested a few times and after a month everyone knew my name
i can not talk or meet up with my previous friends even though they have asked me because i know they will killhurt me
to some people the thought of actually giving up seeking answers from their ex is farfetched or absurd look it is fine to have that opinion your pain is real after all however you still need to realize that the acceptance of not getting any answers or even closure for that matter is the only way to start moving on and to be honest even though you might feel like dying you are not actually dying
i do not want to feel resentful i want to die on my own terms the small important things that did not make her feel alone the gifts

i have been there right where you are no matter what stage you are in just know you are on your path to healing so many ups so many downs but in the end its worth it

winter is coming and i still stare down at my phone too much and waste time ruminatingwaking up and starting day 4 of no contact with you
i know you never lost the spark i know that when they called you even for the 10th time in the same day you still got butterflies just seeing their name on your screen
that is just a way a person can become unforgettable for the rest of your life do i really need to specify that i mean it in a friendly but not romantic way
and lastly will admit i have been smoking more weed than usualsomeone have any similar experience or something that explains or could help

18 is coming faster than i expected as i am turning 17 next month i am slowly approaching my finish and it terrifies me
also another important thing to know is that i had a gay best friend who lived on the same island as me for 6 months
i am very sorry if i do sound selfish but when i talk to my friends when they are feeling down i always do my upmost to make them feel better such as checking up on them but when i feel the same no one does the same for me and i am always the one friend that does initiate the conversation is there any way i can feel less down as i do not feel like i can occupy myself with something without feeling guilty for my friends but they do not do the same for me

since covid19 i have been working more at my assisted living job and i have been spending time with more of the residents

and unfortunately i have the feeling that if i were in a relationship i would immediately drop all my friends i think that is pretty toxic of me
i do not regret a lot in life but i regret drunk texting him because he made it seem we were going to get back together and when i ask he said idk that he could not do it a second time on top of that he rather think i was lonely instead of thinking i still love and miss him well now i know it is officially over n there is no chance

i know manipulation is an awful thing to do to someone but i can not tell if these are ocdrelated intrusive thoughts or thoughts i am genuinely having because i like this person so much and feel like i have to have them no matter how much it costs
i wanted to be there for him so i put all thoughts of a relationship to the side we were exclusive just unofficial
he says he is not in the right mindset for a relationship rn and that he thought he loves me that way but all his emotions are a blur and he can not tell if it is romantic anymore because he can barely feel anything at all even with the new medication he is on
i know that she lied to me manipulated my feelings and strung me along for months in order to save herself the guilt of having to end things but i can not help remembering the beautiful sweet caring girl that i fell in love with over 2 years ago
or it is also possible that i just grew up and the young cheerful crazy girl who loved life that i used to be is not me anymore and i should accept that i changed
i acknowledge my own situation and myself there was better options than myself later though i realized that what exited me was not having sex with them but just be with them
i do this every month with the other tenants that i have been more familiar with over the years so it was no problem for me to do it although i did not know that man as well as the others
same as every year just doing something with my family but no friends have ever really planned anything for my birthday like ever
not to mention he threw a birthday get together in our apartment with all of the furniture i own and my belongings still there while i am in georgia and the girl was there i have every right to be upset do not i
and 5 months later i am still struggling to move on where he has i lay abandoned yet again a familiar feeling experienced too many times i lost count
i could barely see anything but i still remember this distinct smell of burned wood and plastic everywhere i immediately realized my house was on fire and jumped into gear
i 18 soon to be 19m broke up with my ex girlfriend 18f in august right before i left for college
i only thought to write this for myself and to look back on but again i guess i am not a god i am a human and a socialanimal that needs at least some kind of contact with other members of my own species in order for me to survive and live a healthy life
i am heartbroken that it turned out this way that i did not try in life and now i am here now i am this person that is too afraid to do anything i feel like i am in hell i keep asking myself why it turned out like this why did not i try to get help for my problems when they were small why did i not be the person i wanted to be that good person who helps others why could not i have been more outgoing
except one night i was so wasted i told two of my close friends back home about having depression and anxiety and shit i hate saying i have that
but instead i missed him so much it ached and i felt so sad to never be able to experience that drive again
we were together for almost 9 months 3 of those months were supposed to be magnanimous come to find out she was still sleeping with her ex off and on the whole 9 months we were together do not know how to feel except lost sad defeated how can woman be so foul i have never cheated on anyone in my entire life been 2 weeks since we broke up and yet i still think about her every day what is wrong with me
i dealt with rumours and jokes about her at school which pulled me down again from then i could not help but blame myself and my grades dropped too
i will never get a job i lost so many years doing nothing i do not know what to do with my life
my mind may not be able to remember what was done to me but my body remembers why for years i would always be on the edge of my seat ready to run
the worst one was if you are own mother can not stand you how to you expect anyone else to handle you then she just kept going on and on about similar stuff
he said that he want us to be a bestie but he keep avoiding me he did not want to talk with me
it is not like i do not have friends i do i just move around a lot school and city wise so i do not form a close connection with any certain friend i tend to push people away as well i was sexually assaulted this year and felt into a deep depressionaddiction phase as much as i try to open up it always seems like i am so behind in life compared to my friends it is sort ofembarrassing
so i am 18 have chronic depression not many people to reach out to bone cancer and since i am gay and in one of the most homophobic places in the you
i find i could still have the life i did but even then it was not making me happy or was i happy i am not sure anymore
roughly 20 days ago when i made the post i had realized they may have stolen another tool and i only realized at that point it is one that gets calibrated annually for a certification so i could not ignore it
of course you can say that everybody suffers with their own ways maybe my ex wants to text me or reach out bla bla blaaaaaa
i have gone on 2 months of no contact and starting to get the urge to text him tomorrow when it is christmas day in the yous and it is also his birthday i pray for strength
i just want to reset my life and change the mistakes that would not make me depressed i hate myself more than ever for being a dumbass and i will never change myself for the better
i am writing the post because i truly feel completely helpless at the moment and venting looking for support on reddit seems like a good idea
we are still in touch only calls at certain times because i am struggling with my mental health and i can reach out to him whenever i need this and he wants to have deep conversations with me wtf anyways
and started to look at hes venichle searching a problemi started to play with closiest road sign was early morning and mom cames to my room
it is always around this time where i will be doing something to keep busy and my mind busy but out of now where or i am sure it comes from somewhere but my mind will start to go to the same places i try and keep it from dark places with thoughts that are important but should not be stressed on constantly i guess i should tackle it head on and move forward easier said than done
i feel like iam fighting with my demons every day and even when everything around me seems alright i still have a problem to heal my anxiety
just emotionally and mentally drained and i can not stand to live another day in pain i do not have a purpose in this life
on instagram i opened up to him i lied to him and i was referring to my boyfriend as my ex
just want to know what is the worst to expecti have just heard that magnesium can be good for anxiety and depression has anyone here given it a try
whether it is true or she is lying i do not want to let her know i am reading her blog it is very personal for her but i still want to show her some ways to cope
i was born in australia and moved to singapore when i was 7 it was really hard to adapt to a new environment especially being such an introvert
you may be able to relate to these feelingsbruh i am going to go reheat leftover mc donalds from last night and call it a meal
i fucked over a woman i love more than life itself and she hates me and never wants to speak to me again
i said fine you can have tinder but pelase delete the pictures of yourself she would do it i can not bare to see her loving someone else it just breaks my heart
i would be lying if i said it was easy those first few days and i was full of regret for breaking it off
and i sleptwalked apparently my sister said that i got up and went to sleep on the couch i of course do not remember that but she could just be messing with me
i had cookies in the oven and when i bent over to get them out she says i am going to whoop your ass
i have never had a break from anything really so i feel the need to just constantly stress over the smallest things
it never does nothing gets better nothing all i want in like is a gf but i know that is not going to happen either
it is torturing the ever living life out of me i have a best friend who does not get the hints i am laying out for her
but i got a response from a company in the states willing to sponsor me i am so torn as to whether or not i should take it
i am not a licensed therapist at all but for what it is worth many of my friends who participated have called writing these letters quite therapeutic
almost every friend i made once we started to get closer i would find out that they either a had no friends or b did not like their friends for whatever reason
in a few days it is my birthday and i can not do anything but think how he will not wish me happy birthday
i still have mini anxiety attacks from little triggers that remind me of him but i am doing what is best for me right now
i lost my job in june due to covid redundances it was a career i had for 13 years and there is no chance of return anytime soon i do not have any more money left there is no social security measures like unemployment support in the middle eastern country i live in
i do not know if it was something specific i did i have been relitigating it in my head for almost a year now
apparently her mother was not always like this and her family was not always like this but it became a different way about two years ago
please note this is not a crisis hotline but rather a shoulder to turn to when things get rough you can vent all you want just like to a good friend please also note that listeners are not allowed to give advice because you are the master of your own situation you know what to do best 3
i am all alone for 13 years i know the meaning of how true isolation feels ghosted me after he said we would still stay friends and keep in touch
i broke up with them because i hate who we would become neither of us seemed happy and i was exhausted mentally and tired of trying to make it work
manipulative tactics they want you to care so much that it gets to the point to where you believe you have done something wrong when they stop putting the same amount of effort as you in the relationship
i remember how people described me as when i was younger i am only 20 but when i listen to how people remember me when i was 10 a brave boy who was not afraid to sepak his mind cheery and quippy i have become such a carcass of my past seft
i can not control the emotions of others so all i can do is hope that i will not get into serious trouble and to control my emotions however i literally feel like drowning i have this escapist tendency and tend to be anxious
i never had problem talking to people when dealing about job offer school or doing some presentation of my work but when it comes to social interaction i just can not come up with anything
i do remain normal and joke with everyone but i do need supporti told my friend about it who always considered mental health as important
i keep reminding myself all the couples i know that have broken up but ended up back togetheri know i have transference i have major attachment trauma and mama drama
she had issues of her own that i knew but still prioritized my feelings whenever i act up i was inconsiderate
she got very angry because i was disappearing after coming back into her life and told me not to come back until everything was fine but she respected my choice
can someone please tell me what i am doing wrong with making friendsi am terrified that i will go crazy without friends and become something that i have feared the most
i suddenly found myself crying a lot over the baby and wishing silently that i could still have that relationship and so i asked my best friend if there was anyway that i could just be a presence for my ex gfs baby as a father figure
it consists of my little sister our cat peanut and my boyfriend of almost 2 years now i love them more than life itself
i did not have depression when i was little for the most part i was a very happy child and i saw the bright side to everything but i am just not that kind of person anymore
hello everyone something has been bothering me recently and i would like to get your opinions on it so throughout my childhood and teenage years i was always told that i was pouting or being a baby but the more supportive people in my life namely my girlfriend and a couple other close friends make me wonder if this is true
i have exams in 15 year but i just want to spend some time with my friends or with myself but my parents think that i need to prepare for those fucking useless exams because i will not succeed in future but what is the point of studying if i am fucking destroying myself with all this bad thoughts
so it turns out that she was confused with her sexuality and was a lesbian but was not sure yet so she dated me when i asked her out so now i feel empty inside and used i was because she has a lot of problems with her and i have done everything imaginable to be understanding and gave her my support with literally everything she is done
i will be actively helping the people at my university emotional development and fostering a more inclusive conversationand i still had this tiny voice in my head that he does not really want me
i just started college and i was really looking forward to meeting people but now most of my classes are online
just checking in to see if any of you would be interested in joining a chat group eg whatsappi get that at times it gets hard and lonesome been there and still there tbh
hey there so my girlfriend of almost 2 years broke up with me today she was my first girlfriend and the first person i really fell in love with we have been having some problems for some time now and we broke up over text message like 15 minutes ago i do not want to talk to much about this but can you give me some advice or some kind words i am feeling pretty down
i self harm nearly every night that is the only thing that makes me feel alive i have suicidal thoughts almost all the time
i know how i isolate myself but still would be active on social media but seeing that he went on tinder broke me a little
i am not writing this looking for attention i have been told so many times that i am just looking for attention and it hurts but a very tiny part of me hopes that someone could give me a reason live at least one because right now i can not seem to find one
if i try to play my mind would just start screaming about how i am wasting time though nothing really makes me happy anymore
does anyone have any advice on how i can show her i have changed and i have worked and improved my self for the better of the relationship hopefully before she loves on enough to do that stuff with other guys because it terrifies me to the core
i do not want to invalidate any of you here by saying that my suffering is worse than yours i am here to say let us suffer together and keep treating one another as human beings with kindness and compassion if you are suicidal and reading this post i feel you 100 i still want you to live there is hope i care for you as another human being
we agreed to go on a trip to la and spend the night there in the morning she seemed fine but as soon as we got there she went back to being weird i do not like to do things without obvious signs of approval which i thought i had at first such as holding her hand hugging her
she has not responded or reached out since that text and i cut it off this morning via email 4 days before christmas she has not even received all her christmas presents she is in the middle of a family crisis and a work crisis and a health issue and did i mention it is freakin christmas
i filed for unemployment a few months back and i am on the pendingcontact list and have not heard a thing even though i call 23 times a week i am relatively active on reddit so i guess i am just venting because i am just so over everything i am really trying to get things together but no matter what i do it does not work
it is killing me i can not seem to be able to move on i feel stuckm23 ex f23 she broke up with me 3 weeks ago and the reason was long distance
in addition i should use the words i and me tell him about how i feel about his changed behavior and how he hurt me but also that i would still be available if he needed me
our brain want dophamine and make it in cosmical doses any way he need it i am absolutely heartbroken and shocked
i do not have contact with almost anyone any more beacuse everyone i know live on diffrent places but the few times i meet them it does not feel right anymore
i asked for wisdom and god gave me problems to solve i asked for prosperity and god gave me brawn and brain to work
my friend has been hit multiple times by his father for the dumbest of reasons ie if my friend answers something incorrectly he has also said that he was getting mentally abused by his parents and was also kicked out of the house for about 34 hours
why am i like this like what is wrong with me my loneliness is my faulti was 16 years old and i just moved on to another country with my family
talking to her was like crack i just could not get enough of it i really felt like i met someone who meshed with me
not blaming him cuz i said that quite often the desire to claim death seems to get stronger my hair is falling out
but how often can i keep that switch going i do not want to be here that should be enough i feel like the wellbutrin has sent me spiraling into what seems like a possible mixed episode
the more you chase pursue her the more you make her a priority the more you communicate to her that you are needy desperate controlling or spineless or all of the above
i am 22yearsold and i take care of my disabled motheri do not even know what to post what can i say but the usual for this site
all i can think of is the girl i have a crush onprobably with that guy she flirts with at work in front of my face
i do not know when this will stop but i want it to go away so bad i also have been sober for about 2 and a half months from smoking and i was smoking so much everyday for at least 5 months straight
i do not think i have ever wanted to have my life taken away from me i just wish for once i could start on a clean slate it is like every single time i feel like i am getting close to having a clear head someone or something from my past has to come and fuck it all up completely
i know what a piece of shit i am i know that i am a dime a dozen dumb uncultured irresponsible and all that shit
hell it is a trap one that i fell for years ago as i said these gurus exploit men who are in an agitated anxious and hurting state
i wanted to make peace try to understand her to find forgivenessnow i am inclined to make her pay i just see no other way
one friend was suddenly always working and the other friend met a guy and was suddenly with him all the time as well as working a lot
been dealing for 8 years with major depression there was one time 35 years ago that i am still asking myself how i am alive almost 4 years and i do not know how i survived
but now that i am quite literally in isolation i am struggling a lot both with my mental health and with the reality that he is no longer here for me
my nan recently died i am struggling mentally there is family drama etc of course i am not going to be calm on the fucking call
i feel like i have compromised my mental health for the sake of nothing it started as a knot in my stomach it does not feel natural or normal to me
even just touching kissing softly and sharing assurance that all of our stresses all anxiety all fear and doubt will disappear because we are here right now alone but in no way lonely
i was living abroad in my 20s and got together with someone in my friend circle quite close to when i planned to return home we both knew about this but both wanted to be together anyway and enjoyed a wonderful few months together and then five weeks travelling together
i suffered when it turns out he is helping his beloved wife to get papers and they are still married she left him but still he love her
it is my birthday but i am really feeling down when i said what we had was beautiful he said no it was not beautiful it was nice
you said i gave you a love that you did not deserve that i deserved someone better someone who would reciprocate the love that i gave out because i loved you so much that it hurt it hurt you because you knew that you would not do the same
and of course i did not either but i was not doing him any favors i had been enabling him for so long
i failed every class again and i just feel hopeless i used to struggle with substance abuse but since covid i have developed an awful online gambling problem
from mid october i tried to change a few things in life mostly in dedication of my grandmas drink way less alcohol no smoking improving conversational knowledge how to cnnect with women better apparently it sucked in some areas reading stuff for my studies sport on a regular basis etc
i am scared when i go into work tomorrow i will get in trouble for going home the worst part is i lied to the closest person too me
i worked hard i put blood sweat and tears into that department and then in october i was told about great work place
i used to laugh at suicide memes but now i can not anymore i just remember how my friend failed his attempt
it is utterly delusional to believe that you are completely alone in your emotions anyway but even the least empathetic people understand suffering and isolation of some kind
i can get distracted very easily i want to be so succesfull but i do not even want to get up from my bed
but how do you disregard the trust issues you have come to have from breakups and to be able to allow love in again i do not want to be closed off to potentially good relationships but then again i just want to continue working on myself
i do not want to explore anything about this world i honestly do not care about the things i do not know i have no obligation to this world either nothing holding me back
when you have a major depressive disorder nothing hurts more than living the person you hate the most is yourself you keep radiating pain for yourself and you can not stop it
i have never been to therapy and never been diagnosed with anything but i am fairly certain i deal with depression and definitely anxiety
while i knew he was not where i was emotionally he still liked me and liked being my boyfriend he always reassured me
i have had it for as long as i can remember when i was 13 i remember crying because i was too scared to go up and get food at a buffet my parents are very religious and agenst therapy
he broke up with her 2 years before he met me but they were friends while we started datingi told my friend about it who always considered mental health as important i suffer from depression and anxiety
3 say hi to other masked people when we pass on the street5 music music is really helping me not feel alone
now two months later i hear from my friends how she is living her life normally it hurts i have felt nothing but misery what hurts more is how easily she moved on and forgot what i had done for her these past four years
i am really hurt about all of that and i would feel like i am loosing my dignity even more if i confronted anyone about this because then if they would change they would change because i told them not because i am important to them
it has gotten progressively worse with the ongoing stress from my job i have never had mental health issues and would like to get some
it is hard to process it but when you are talking about replacing yourself and people do get to that extent
they broke up but on good terms they both just did not have interest in each other at the end thanks to anyone for actually reading all this i appreciate it
i wish our relationship ended on a horrible awful note i wish we were screaming i hate yous to each other
i saw him as a threat and it was a threat towards my angel he said he would wait for me to get better i have known him for three months
i lost a friend to suicide so i know the voice is lying as it lied to my friend because i did care it did hurt i do miss him and i did love him but deep down i think i am not my friend i have no one he had everyone no one would miss me no one would notice i was gone i just want it to stop
if i was worthy i would not be thinking about my death on christmas and not being able to have 5 minute talk on the phone with someone who knows me
i am done with everything should i take a bunch of pain killers and down it with booze or i am considering the burning charcoal method but do not want to burn the place down and potentially hurt my cat i need to choose
like i am a shit human because i can not fix it i know that is so stupid but that is the best explanation i have
i have found in the end no one gives a shit people will abandon you when you are least expecting it you can not trust people who say they care and love you because they will just turn around and destroy you when you are least expecting it
the fear and isolation i felt the first time we went into lockdown has set in again with 45 minutes until the lockdown officially comes into effect i feel as though the clock is ticking
why do you feel like always being mean and cruel why well because you are and now this is all on you and i so know karma
it is been more than a month now and i still feel absolutely heartbroken and cry a lot they took away the mood stabilizers that i desperately needed i am bipolar 2 i need these medications
like no that shit makes me feel so much worse there is noone who feels love for me i do not even know anyone anymore so how could they why even suggest that despite not knowing jack about who is seeing the post weird
they seemingly only want to communicate when something bad is happening in their lives or minei am trying to understand why my friends are like this but i just do not get it
this world would be better off without me my kids would become great people without me and this is when i thought myself no this does not seem right
maybe he would be willing to come back if i work on my needinessinsecurity and he would realize that he thinks i am worth it even if this girl is in his same university major and talked with him for four hours a few days the week they met maybe they will have too much in common and he will miss my quirkiness
hope for what a better future it could end up just as bad or worse and i wasted my whole life wishing it was heyyer or i never had one
i thought we were good together with a few things that could be fixed but maybe i was wrong and just being stupid i will be there as a friend when you need me and do what i can to help you feel stable but if we can not be together i will leave once you are steady i would not be able to move on
you can be happy on your own the happiness you emanated when you were with him it is yours it is within you when he left that happiness did not leave
within a week of us really talking we already had sex it kind of gave me a little bit of a red flag but i ignored it because i was happy with where i was at with her
what are some things i can do to be happy with myself and discover who i amso my dad have always had a bad temper but nowadays the reason for it is getting stupid
and that is just an example of thoughts i have in my mind replacing the good times i am supposed to have with my family and my kids
in other time of my life i would be scared but now i feel free for the first time in my life i am free to do whatever i want and not been criticised for that
eventually i tried to reach out to my best friend again someone who i had been friends with for almost 17 years now and she ignored my message for 10 days
it is crazy to think how much my mindset has changed in the last year that i honestly thought it would be impossible to get out of
i tired of walking on eggshells around him and still getting yelled at but i am so afraid to leave both because if i am honest about his reaction and of the unknown
its been really like this because after he dropped out of school around 11th i took it as nothing would ever change
one time he watched me cry about finding out someone i used to be friends with had died he did not even really say anything to me
i had a discussion with my ex just yesterdayit was about our brakup all their tests show that my symptoms are small to non existent for now
we broke up because as he says i am emotionally needy and he is emotionally lazyis me being to niceinnocent the problem with me
i want to commit suicide but i am scared i am not going to actually end myself immediately and i will suffer like i did the first time
however i am considering at what point do those labels become a social convenience to pin on an individual a certain type of person rather than acknowledging that they are living a certain type of life which could be different to the groups around them
i feel sorry for not having been up to her expectations and needs and that she wanted or decided to hide it from me for some reason
do not think about anything at all try not tohow do you feel if you do not know you do not have to come up with an answer
on sunday she brought me a thoughtful gift and a touching card that said she looked forward to another great year together
hopefully you just look at it like a stupid attention seeking post or a too long wall of text to read just like someone said do not look at me as if i am a friend this is a business just a show for all of us i get money from it
she told me she will never be like the people who hurt me in the past people who becomes a part of me and then slowly fades away to nothing
hi thanks for reading this post if you want to know my current situation with my ex you can check out my previous posts on my profile
you see l meant to drink and play r6s with my best friend the one i am loyal to but only seems to be around at convenience we have had 3 fallouts before 2 over 1 female he came running to me months ago when she dropped him oh well he messaged me and wanted to play destiny 2 yuck i divorced that game for a reason
we could have comforted each other through this long winter had so many more special happy times it is too late now
they kind of save my life everyday when they ask me how i am or want to meet or show that they care about me or think about me in any form
i can not bear being anxious panicked depressed and deep in my phobias all the time i just want to rest but i can not i simply can not
i am jealous when he wants to spend time with anybody else but me i use silent treatment and hotandcold to get more of his affection
then one day after a lot of mistreats he told me that he would hit me we were arriving home and he normally locks the door of his room where my pijamas are i was angry already and thought that it is ridiculous habit and told him to please open the door maybe passive agresive tone and he told me that i should shut up or he would hit me
and it would be understandable for people to react this way to be depressed if something in their life happened that was a big change but for me nothing has seriously change everythings the same the only time i feel like this is when reality hits me in the face and that reality is that i am alone and i am alone with my feelings having no one to share them with except with people that either do not care or will just use the information that i shared with them as a tool to use me in the future or to just torment me
my honesty in wanting to end things but lacking the energy or motivation to do so meant i was safe enough to go home and begin an outpatient program
i know everyone will say do not talk to him move on but i know he is my person hello everyone i am here to vent for the most part
if you made it this far thanks for reading and i hoped there was some helpful info for you just honesty and openness
obviously i can not finish essay on time sometimes i even end up not starting the essay the mean the world to me i would do anything for them
i am in college right now and i made a couple of friends who i thought would stick in particular this one girl who was closer to me than the others
my ex broke it off a week ago today 2 days later i saw her online dating profile staring back at me i was just using it as a distraction she is likely talking to new men right now looking for validation and excitement i know she is looking for sex rhe feeling of closeness and that is okay
should i get back in dating apps i had some but deleted them a year ago because i did not feel like it was me at the time but should i try it again to get back out there
just breaks me everyday i just hope one day i can wake up and not feel like this anymorei am sort of happy with my new person but i am not
you can accomplish anything you put your mind to so do not ever dount your ability you may be alone at times but your strong and you can overcome anything
i also have no pets or anything and i can not get any right now and most of my hobbies are something that only causes pain because i am not able to do them in an injured and isolated state of being
if you find yourself unlovable unworthy or incompetent ask yourself what brought you to that conclusion a dysfunctional relationship with your family childhood traumas did your parents not pay any attention to you or we are they control freaks did you have a traumatic breakup or even an array of unfortunate breakups that made you feel unworthy of love or a great partner
we started talking again everyday behaving like we did not really break upi just broke up with my ex who i had been friends with for a year prior to dating
it is very hard on him as he is felt stuck the whole year because of this and he is just working on his business but needs to know if he is getting into the military or not to be able to actually start it
i started about a month ago and it was slow it was hard but when i had 1 person come in and i shared who i was and what i was about it was so beautiful
i do not think i am too ugly or anything i do not find myself unattractive at all but i just can not recognize myself as a person
should i go to medical and talk to someone or should i just wait it out i do not want people to know and i also heard that i may get discharged if i tell people about all of this
does anyone have any suggestions on how to get ahold of the anxiety or have you been in a similar situation before
at first i did not feel like it i was happy and thanks to all the advice moved on but after a talk on the phone he asked me if we could take a walk together because he wanted to talk about the mistakes he made during the relationship so after a little consideration i agreed and we met up yesterday
my loneliness makes me feel things that are difficult to control and what i said above this is something i think it is important to be with me
i took the time to rewrite my suicide note and i am giving myself one more year to say goodbye to my loved ones and maybe one more year to appreciate life before i end mine
he has full custody of my younger sister while i am in foster care we dated while we were in the school program for 1 year
i know i will get heat for this but i am not ready to end it either idk how things would go if we did try again but i know the positive times i had with him outweigh the negative but this was a pretty extreme reaction i am going to and i can not forecast if we will always be arguing over things like this i hope you guys can provide some guidance and thanks in advance
ideally i would want a gun but my country has pretty strict gun lawsi do not know for sure yet if i want to
you could not say i love you and you said to stop saying it and i stopped i said i will never said it again until you will say it first
so i have given up i feel jaded i do not think anyone actually does or ever will love me it just does not happen for me
but i have been distant because i get this feeling like i am annoying him all the time all of my friends are still friends with them
he said he wishes me al the best and i should just try and work on myself and be the best for myself and he knows i can do it
one day he was finally done with me bothering him and blocked me on every single thing i went around it for a few days
i know it would not be a good situation because the distance and the fact we always accused each other of being unfaithful
then when this pandemic hit she completely ignored me i texted her a couple of times but she only texted me one word answers
that being said i just messaged my first ever partner none binary going to be using theythemi have been planning on killing myself for a while and i think i will do it soon
but i still remember when we talked as friends he brought bring up his ex casually like how she also likes hearing the sound of his voice
i could go on for hours and i have before about everything that is been wrong with me throughout the years and everything is just getting worse as time goes on i have been on a variety of different meds throughout the years but they only help keep me a little more level
keep doing this over and over again while it will be challenging to sustain your focus for more than a few breaths initially it does become easier further down the line
and then i woke up i felt my heart racing really fast it almost hurt me i did not leave my room since then somewhere around 8 hours and i do not really want to i am trying to calm down after this
i am just so incredibly hurti keep telling myself to ease myself she is fucking cancer good thing she is gone i am sick i cry every day
i went out to talk with my ex gf i stayed silent while she screamed everything at me then she went away
i feel like you are very dependant emotionally and on a couple other things i need someone that is independent and and can do things on her own too
i do genuinely understand that but this has started to genuinely make my life so difficult now and my mental health is struggling massively
basically in june i quit my job inn order to praise fir my suicide though i did not go through with it i have not been seeking enjoyment either
my family and friends do not want to spend christmas with my this year partially due to covid restrictions here in london and just plain right fuck this guy kind of attitude
i just feel like there is no other path my life is going to go down except suicide i am too old now to be considered as full of opportunities especially when my work history is so sporadic i do not see a way out of this downward spiral but i am still too scared to do anything to myself
on mobile today was a horrible day i had a panic attack when talking to my parents they tried to hug me and make me feel better but i pushed them away i could not bare having anyone touch me i wanted to go away and i drove a good 50km till i just ran out of energy my siblings came and brought me back home
i met a few girls at orientation and i thought we were getting along well but they keep hanging out with me
i am talking to a close friend as i type this but i feel so alone while i am talking to her idk why i feel this way and i am not sure if i should open to her or what i am just confused on why i feel alone
to the person who is reading it thank you for taking your time to do so but i am sure what i need to do now
i feel bad things so so intense and when i am back to my normal self i think of myself as a dramatic bitch
for context me being rude is both me not talking and talking too much being too reserved and being to forward and basically anything i do she finds a problem with
i am really proud of myself i have been managing to get a decent amount of social interactions recently and its very unusual for me but it feels good haha
job none worked as web dev for 2 years then worked at a warehouse for 6 months money enough for next months rent but that is it
then in october i had some pretty bad health issues going on and she was always there for me and helped me through it but on halloween we broke up because after she graduates college next year she wants to move somewhere else and me being a musician who has dreams of touring things would get complicated down the road
i have a roommate a dog but a lot of times i think about just getting a one bedroom and being alone with my dog because it would be easier to be left alone due to the stress i feel being around another person the stress i because others
i can not think of her voice in my head i can not think of what sex felt like until i have sex again
this is my time to find what i truly want to do with my life and improve who i am as a person
so a couple of days ago this online friend i have just bursted out into random insults and anger at me just because i did not ask her to play a video game with me whenever i started it up with my fiance
i have no idea why but throughout the day i am my usually numbed depressed self but at least once a day i get this random surge of boiling rage
it should be me why do i have these thoughts i am fed up with everything nothing feels right i just feel numb
most of my days i spend the entire day from when i wake up till i go to bed behind my desk
so this fit of rage i went into was so bad they made new friends but they still hang out with each other but they leave me out
at this point no one will understand my behavior unless you have dealt with mental illness you do not understand it or comprehend it i am going to
i have holidays now but the days on which i go to school are not any better i was looking forward to this winter break because i needed a while to relax but it is so disappointing
we had a date and after my apology we got back together about how nothing makes sense and that the world was created to drive you insane
i do love her and i trust her but i was on my own time schedule and it just was not good enough for her
i made you my world but you were not even worth my one second i am glad you are gone now i am relieved
i think about her constantly i count down the days until our next session i have platonic fantasies about us being friends or her being my mother she encourages blogging and emailing for me because i struggle with face to face interactions so i often email and blog between sessions occasionally she will send a quick reply of support or encouragement i find myself refreshing my email literally 100x a day hoping she has replied
like some kind of emotional memory loss or something like the memories i do have were not even mine or were from a past life
in order to go inside one has to pay normally since my moms house was just across the beach i trespassed by jumping over the fence to get inside
everytime i calm down and see what i have done i always say that i am sorry and i will do better and she trusted me that i will
i always feel like i am just a burden and i just wish i could fucking dissappear a couple of months passed another lockdown was imposed by our government
times are tough we have all had a difficult year we would not be on this particular page otherwise but i just wanted to remind you that you are loved and incredibly cared for i know for some of you this may just be gibberish and some letters on the computer screen but it is true you are loved
i had friendships but none of them really lasted many of my friends had busy families and siblings to take care of something i could not relate to
has anyone ever been in a similar situation that could offer me advicemy opinion might be a little controversial but i am open to discuss it
i cry in the car because i try to hold things together in front of people for so long i might seem naive and stupid for staying but i just wanted to let this out somewhere
world is supress you by negative and our mind also want it i mean you read this post so you want it
i honestly was thinking already a while ago just leaving them and search for other people but easier said than done
i am not happy now at this point any ablebodied nonmentally ill person would get up and get a job i have tried
how do people expect me to believe that i just can not take it anymore i do not know why nothing is working
i put most of the effort in and she kept herself busy so she did not have to think or feel about our relationship
i tried to i know that i can not blame anyone else but myself it was not until my dad cancelled something on me that it all came out again
and i thought then that that is it this year will be all about me and oh god it was quarantine started can not leave the house because of family
helped him move into an apartment with his momi think i reached my breaking point my whole lofe has been a shitfest
loneliness is extremely hard everyone i am alone 247 everyday of the year i am invisible live in an unfriendly world people are pretty callous only advice or suggestion i ever get is to call the damn crisis line and they are no help in fact after 10 minutes they tell that they need to go besides i have called them so much since covid 19 i have burned them out
hello folks my so is depressed after the unfortunate passing of her mother as one can understand like i can move my balcon abit upsideand top balcon closer to y window
with a strong friends help we have not spoken in weeks and i have stopped crying and feeling in pain i am deficient and goalless i have not had a dream or aspiration in my life
i have passing grades ipads a phone parents who buy me what i want on most occasions and good true friends and yet have considered suicide and attempted suicide so much these past few months and nothing wrong is happening around me
without my therapist fearing that i will hurt myself or act on my thoughts it could be a significant other or just a friendi just want someone who thinks about me
i went onto tinder and for whatever reason checked his profile and saw that he had updated it with the phrase
she also threatened to kill me or strip me naked and kick me out or take me to a place i would get raped
i told him to get the help he needs for his depression and anxiety get his finance together 20k usd in debt i told him if he is having dark thoughts please text or call me since he is bringing up suicide for few days
when i look at my photos i seem to be inherently dumb usually as if i had no idea what is happening around me and makes me feel the exact opposite of what i usually feel like
and at this very point i have come to acceptance that this loneliness will be part of me leading a life like this until the day where the borders are opened and my life has turned around for the better i will have to deal with and let it make me stronger
however starting a few months ago i did and they are always in third person likr a movie as if my view is a camera and sometimes i am not even in the dream myself but am always far away
today school principle invited my parents to school all of the teachers told how badly i am doing and that i am a terrible student
she at that point gave me what was supposed to be our 1 year anniversary gift i gave her my happiness for her sake and now it is gone
i broke down this morning over a song and it messed my life up i did not know what i was doing or why i was doing it
i feel like a mess i feel like such a complex mess of all these different issues i do not know how to explain to someone that actually maybe there is something missing from my diagnosis and like which issue do i try therapy for first like there is so many
long story short we broke up over my insecurities and not being able to meet each others needs he is avoidant i am anxious i am definitely leaning towards being codependent and he is the complete opposite he does not believe in monogamy i do he cares more about himself i cared too much about him he always needed space i always wanted closeness
my mom cried talking about her parents and the things she regrets i hate so much that i am going to because her even worse pain but i really can not go on like this i fucking hate consciousness no one in my family suspects anything it is going to hit them hard i wish when i died i could just be immediately forgotten i do not want anyone to have pain over me i am not worth it
she was clear that she did not want to cut all ties and we ended on a pretty good note we kissed each other and said our goodbyes for the time being during our two week no contact phase she has posted various things to try to get my attention including tons of snapchat stories with inside jokes just between us but i abstained for awhile
i definitely deserve to die and whenever i convince myself not to kill myself i just remember that id be doing the world a pretty big favor by doing it and it starts all over
trying to sort what i can before i go but besides that i am not too sure what to do with the next few days feeling this sense of peace and finality after all this time is really refreshing and although i have some anxiety i am feeling ready for it
they say be careful what you wish for because you just might get it well on this christmas i asked to not wake up
it was my first time speaking to a psychologist in a clinical setting where i was the subject of the conversation
i usually spend my time on this app reading relating but i need some unbiased opinions obviously my friends family will always have my side so here is a sorta short story of my relationshipbreakup my ex just turned 32 and me 23 about to be 24 dated and lived together for 2 years almost
we do not want to live in hell she has offers and options to not live here but absolutely insisted she wants to be here
she called me in july with just wanted to see how you are doing vibes days later she said something a little shitty i got triggered and i told her off
ever since elementary school i have had a pretty rough life bullied from elementary to middle school i have found a lot of unpleasant and soul crushing truths about the people around me and my parents and that has taken a drastic toll on me
he is just so unloving so vicious so cruel to people not only me cruel to his friends cruel to his family
i have had 2 friends die in the past 2 years so that is caused me to feel down especially since i was very close with them and have an extremely difficult time making deep friendships
i used to work for the coroners office this time of year is unbelievably hard for many people for example she says you will never learn how to live your life
as now at that time i felt the need for love i always felt bad alone and i have practically no friends
i can never be in a job for more than a month neveri 26m moved to london to follow my girlfriend 23f we would been dating for 3
i love her so much and of course only want her to be happy so have been very understanding she currently does a lot school work etc
no suicide note just gun shot to the temple i think that is why i will be good at actually following through
no friend ever reaches out to me first and it always feels like i have to always put in the effort to reach out or else ill just be lonely
i hate my family i hate myself i do not remember much of the summer after that i cried myself to sleep every night
told me he could not stand to sit here all day today and watch me cry he said i do not do anything
hobbies but instead i just sit here so fucking sad scared and useless in my country only chefs waiters and those who work at hotelsbarsrestaurants survive
i am just not able to really express it i have been bullied since little because i am not showing emotions they were genuinely horrible
accept that sometimes you will feel inadequate and that some people are just happier or more competent than you and that that is ok
also the emotional part destroyed me i think with my heart rather than my brain the only thing i remember is that once i had a serious about what called head concussion
i still can not get a relationship started i am still poor i still have no friends still do not have a very good job on top of that now i am older less energetic less motivated less ambitious more relatives have died my health is worse i look worse i feel worse
we also texted later on in the night where she told me it had nothing to do with me she was just not ready
i am super sad just broke up with a long distance boyfriend and i just want to beg to be with him again
it is almost fucking christmas yet i am contemplating killing myself i just want the pain to stop and i thought what a waste of a wish and so i texted him
even though i was just silently admiring her with loving eyeslive unhappy and working and putting effort into things when you do not want to
the police refer to me as a dv victim and it literally broke my heart because i can not come to terms with that
now it will never happen no one sees me as a long term option or loves me for real i feel trapped and i suffer everyday i do not know what to do
i feel like they are annoyed and fed up with it but i just do not know i am hurt thinking about them together
i even thought about an open relationship but it turns out it is no going to work for me where i am going to stay how i am going to get somewhere
edit just a few extra questions should i bring my own clothes will i be able to keep my phone with me should i bring documents from past therapists
like i do not know if i am afraid of death because i do believe in some sort of after life i just do not know what
i always desired that awesome bond of reciprocation and productivity and experiencing the world together and the joys of just not being so fucking alone
day after day my heart breaks from my loneliness it feels like it is being stabbed all over like it is being used like a stress ball or like a freezing void has appeared in it and now matter how hard i squeeze a pillow to my chest i can not fill that void
in 2 years since escaping a sexually abusive situation in my home i have dated 3 peoplei19f suspect he26m abuses me emotionally as i do him
how can i cope with feeling extremely anxious and although i have already discussed with my family how my mental health is right now i do not feel they get it
when she said that to me i got so happy i jumped and danced around my room this is possibly the best day of my life
i already thought of breaking up countless times but was afraid of hurting him so it is a good thing that he decided to break up
are those all the same things i am not even sure any more because the feelings have been here for so many years13 years to be exact
with what a friend of mine stated is that possibly true and if it is the likely reason why i was supposedly a terrible boyfriend in her eyes so why even messaged me essentially a year later to end on good terms surely you would want nothing to do with them if they were that bad
one really frustrating way is that i only have one or two friends both live far away and have fairly different interests then me
i have tried so hard everytime i felt motivated i lost that motivation in a matter of a day it was right back to despair and sorrow
really need someone who hug me and tell me that everything is going to be alright and that they will be there i need to know that someone care about me for real and will try to make me feel better
one of the days he did not come home which is abnormal but it is also not normal for us not to talk for longer than maybe a night
your real would do anything to have you by their side forever and keep you because every time they even hear your voice or you name they feel it
i am very selfconscious and he is the only person i have ever felt comfortable being fully naked in front of he made me feel so incredibly safe and he made me love my body more
not trying for whatever reason it is depressing but not nearly as painful but always always i come back to trying i am not sure why i mean i guess it is because it is a primal urge the need for love and sex the need for other people the constant hope
she became addicted to taylor swifts breakup songs that made me feel uncomfortable i asked her why do you listen to these songs do you have hangups with your ex she said no that she just loves the song bec it sounds nice
i have been an invisible student for all those years of my school life very few teachers would recognize me if they saw me today
he and my mom divorced before i even turned a year old she was calling me for the last couple weeks in the middle of the night
she repeatedly says that i would not feel this way if it were not for my dad which is not true since this has nothing to do with him she is been absolutely horrible and refuses to see that she has any form of fault in any of this
i have been lonely my whole life but this time is differenti feel like i have no one to look forward to seeing after the quarantine ends
but i have not seen a single goddamn plant grow in the pile of dried soil she even watches tv but still wants nothing to fucking do with me i do not want your help you can not give me any if you were planning on doing so but feel free to comment anything you want i will read your thoughts of my loneliness that is what your here for either way
i want to try to be without you and perhaps in the future i would love to be in a relationship with another woman it is normal
i hope you all have fun sorry 4 the long post i would have written way more cuz shits more complicated than that but whatever thx a lot for reading have a great day
after a couple hrs i finally get up to check it out it was an old iphone 4 that did not turn off
the only thing stopping me from ending it right now is the financial burden that not having me around would put on my mum and dad if it were not for that i do not think i could make it much longer
does anyone know any ways to help get over a relationship that is over but at least these greedy bastards have their money
i still love you so much i would die for you i still scream your name to the rooftops when i am alone i miss our chance of having a family i miss our cuddle time i miss everything and i am just balling here in the bathroom floor organizing my tampons that i dropped everywhere because i am fucking bleeding everywhere and i hate it
i can not sleep without journaling can not wake up without having written the agenda for todayi had no friends or anyone who i trust more than her so i asked her to remain friend
i do not even know why i posted this i know it is mostly because of the pandemic but even my side gigs are dried up
i also made this part gets a little dark someone kill themself because of how annoying i am something as simple as drinking and watching a movie at someone is house terrifies me
they have e stains since him and his mom have lived here for 14 years and nothing has been updated or repainted
i even lost my virginity to him that is why i think i am so attached to him i have been told i am ugly and i think i am ugly
i have always been quite a logical person who prefers to focus on present realities than what ifs and abstract theories but i feel that my mental illnesses have tainted my thinking instead of my disorders being debilitating they are now just annoying
my boyfriend just cheated on me and then broke up with me and it was incredibly sudden i did not see it coming at all
thank you for reading and have a nice day you it is okay if you do not reply comment if you want to rant anything here go with it i will read it
i stopped caring about my family basically everyday i think of dying and killing myself at some point in the day
i am a recent college graduate who is currently unemployed because i chose to take a gap year while applying for law schools for 20212024
i know finally we are alone it causes that i do not like anyone deeply because i do not want to depend someone
you have to change that first i went to her house i got my stuff back and i gave her my stuff back
guys do not want that and they do not understand it and they want to have it their way or nothing at all
i am tired of not having anybody to talk to or anybody to love i want to elaborate more with this post but i can not that is exactly how i feel
for example there was this guy that i knew 78 years back we were friends at the time but not really great friends just we smoked weed together in a group of people sometimes only with him too
wish i could turn back time and redo it all wish we could go back to the excitement of that first date when it was still pure and good
i have done everything i could and it seems like i can not fix any of my problems in my dysfunctional life or change my mood
but fast forward to last week she gets really distant all of a sudden and tells me she needs a break
i would give anything to have her back and have a 2nd chance i know it will get better but it is so hard to think like that
i have a gun but i do not really want to be dead i love him too i love the life we are building but i am exhausted i hate that i could be dead in the spare bedroom and he would not know he would not notice
i have been to therapy for seven years and i feel as if i am just in this constant loopwith the shower hose it does not work either no matter how deep i cut it did not bleed
it was a healthy and mature relationship but we just had to end it because one of us could not really see ourselves marrying the other person
dating and sex have been a hard no pass i have 3 good quality long term friends but my declining mental health is a broken record to them
i looked at his insta it is been three months wish me luck i just wanted to take this out of me right now
i will be okay tomorrow because this was only a moment of realization for me i had to share these feelings somewhere because i forgot what hurts me so much and i have not had anything emotionalrelated that brought me down to tears at the initial thought of the emotion like loneliness did
she knew i was still into her and told her it takes me a while to build up the courage and we carried on talking all day every day for 3 months
he still had not engaged in therapy he said he was waiting for a call back but was not making any follow up calls himself
but it is not for her she showed me how to fight for myself and for that i will be forever grateful
she had the job for less than a month but she already traded me for them or at least that is what i thought
you are a piece of shit i do not want to do anything with you anymorei know that in general frequent crying spells probably indicate mental health issues
i want to fucking jab a fucking knife into my throat so i can diei will never be able to change my childhood
my ego will not get a thing out of it all together except more pain why am i still obsessing over the thought and the what if scenario how stubborn and who exactly what part of me is trying to provoke me to take action that might not be in my favor praying and hoping maybe just maybe it could work out
but later that night i was home when i heard a knock on my front door and i opened it to see her standing there
if you have ever faced this and you do have any solution i would be grateful besides if there are any articles that can give me knowledge about this please do not hesitate to share
and all i want to do is prove to him how much i love him and that i am willing to do anything to spend my life with him
her mom started hating me like 4 months ago and my gf had a big fight with her and she broke up with me
i am very nervous about posting this but i do not want to feel bad about it anymore sorry if it is too long and if my grammar and format is bad
maybe we just were not there yet maybe we were never going to get there but what if we were i left
i do not want to live but i do not want to have to make myself die i want someone or something to do it for me
so i do not plan on leaving this friendship it is a hurdle that i want to overcome as healthily as possible whilst tressuring the friendship
to top it off i had nobody to help me and my insurance ended i was taken off my medications and could not longer see my therapist
he would constantly checks things out checking if he has wallets keys and phone always being late to family functions and even to work checking to see if others are okay as well
it seemed so good yet now it seems detached from your very being like it is not actually your life that you are recalling
sometimes i wonder if i should cover them up andor if people silently freak out when they see them is it badweird that i do not hide them
rather not disclose age but i am a male and under 16 i have tried talking to people about it but i have been ignored and in some cases i have been told depressionsuicidal feelings are not real
at times i feel so incredibly numb and disconnected from everything it is fucking infuriating and just i feel so alone at times even when i am talking to those friends
probably going to kill myself at the end of december or early january my online friends have been super inactive and i do not see a point in going on anymore also pretty tired of everyone fighting over race and politics
i would ask him if he wanted to come walk the dog and if he was busy that i was happy to go myself on quite a few occasions he would say yes in a few minutes and keep no track of time the time estimate given was random and the longest i waited was 4 hours because he got mad when i interrupted him working
it is an unfun unrewarding boring life feel like i should have become something in my twenties instead of give a damn about my health everytime
if anybody has any insight into what may be going on or how i can get help i much appreciate it
i am not saying it is her fault for lying after all people lie all the time i just hate myself that for a second i actually believed her and let my guard down that i actually thought that she loved me for who i was and not for the way i made her feel
each time you give your ex another chance to rekindle things you lose another shard of respect but hey you love them so you stay stuck in a toxic relationship and think that if you just keep loving them their behavior will change someday
i feel like i have been slowly isolating myself from those i was close to over the last couple years i miss having connections to people but i am having a hard time trusting people i am sitting by myself in the dark on a saturday night in silence just desperately seeking someone to have a conversation with and wondering how i got to this place of such extreme loneliness
ps fuck this pandemic i am at an age that all i want to be doing is going out getting drunk and meeting people instead of overthinking shit like this but that is not possible
i can not use the utensils in my house as i have to use disposable ones as i will wonder who touched them before me
update actually i do not anymore lol reacting is the same simple thing i do with the other people that replies to my activities so why make it a big deal he is already downgraded himself to a stranger anyway i did not lose progress
i do not find joy in others pain but it was nice to know that you are not handling this break up well either
i did not know what to do i just was trying to make the best financial and healthy decision for our future and keep you at the same time
i then later dreamt about her that night it made me realize something very importantmy eyelids have scary faces thatsv contort in ways i can not explain
she did her own thing and did things she knew i would not like i am going to find a way to make them feel the pain they caused me that is my reason to live
maybe this is only a false doom did not want to assume things but i just noticed people including my friends often forget that i am there
addiction and alcoholism contributed to the escalation of violence and toxicity of course but the relationship was also a contributing factor to my substance abuse over those 7 years
i live alone in london i have not got that many friends here accept for my cats and some work colleagues i feel like i could slip away easily and nobody would really notice
i am sure many have had better results she was not angry or hurt or upset she was content being alone and did not want to try anyone
we had some minor disagreements but mostly because we were adjusting with living together like i hate doing the dishes and he always left the toilet window open which i hate but apart from that we were creating a rock solid relationship
then it feels real for a second i lost another teacher to cancer this year and a 3rd was just diagnosed
i am preparing to lead cultural discourse at my university it details my experience with depression drug addiction nearly dying and finally healing my trauma for all
i was just so hurt and cried a lot i end up hitting her up to see how she was doing
i am up for j pouch surgery which is the last thing the hospital can offer me in terms of treatments that is unless i need a permanent bag
thank you everyone we will all get through these heartbreaks put on us and come out stronger we can overcome everything that life throws at us i wish you all the best and hopefully find those people who will be right for us one day but first we need to find ourselves again
i went to her room and she jokingly replied you are out of your mind before i wanted to leave i simply said i am sorry for being a loser and she lost it
even now i can not be mad at him i can only feel sad because i know he is not mine and he is someone elses and i do not know what to do or how to feel anymore
obviously i am still hurt in ways but i have really just accepted the fact that i deserve so much better in life and i am perfectly happy with working on myself and improving my own life without having a boyfriend to worry about
attempted to hang myself but could not bring myself to do it any easier methodsand that is one of the reasons i started selfharming myself
big nono you all selflove is key because of covid they sent me home this whole day has been a web of lies
she had been self isolating for a couple of weeks due to having covid i am thankful for you guys you helped me through a lot of rough times thank you
she seemed so perfect for me i felt truly loved for once i felt like i could talk about anything with that person and i was very safe
a month later i finally unfriendedunfollowed your friends and family and will try and go back to a life where you never existed
an easily duped rube why does it hurt so much to be rejected by those people that seem pretty effed up themselves
i believe we have many soulmates in our lives and they were one of mine and its okay that our period is over
my parents will not let me go alone because they are strict if i went with one of my online friends i am scared they would fine out and be mad
please excuse the long elaboration but i can not keep anything short for the life of me and i am in need of advice i have been a mess throughout this year i suffer from depression anxiety i have commitment issues etc but a few months ago i met the most amazing guy ever i am 30 and he is 28 we just clicked right away it was magical until he left me without a word
i am more than 30 but i still like it and it is ok to do so because it is part of who i am people care about it or not
so as you can even though we were not an official couple i was emotionally invested into the relationship well yesterday she met with a high school friend and had sex with him and told me after i got mad we argued and deleted her from my contact list and i had a sleepless night
if i die no one would care as in real life as everyone ignore me when i try to say something
i just love her so much and i do not want to end our relationship i am otherwise physically healthy and yet i get very very sick treatments get less and less effective
it was my 20th birthday and i was out in another city for a work trip it was12 am it was my birthday i waited 2 hrs no one called or texted me the colleague i was sharing my room with was asleep
well he laughed at me i do not know how to respond to this he thinks i am a joke i just want to know if i am doing something wrong here also note that me and my ex talked almost non stop so when it was over i had nothing nobody
he has never hit me but as i have told him if he ever did that would be it no second chances if he did
i am sick and tired of putting myself out there and getting rejected or put down it is deteriorating my self confidence and reinforcing social anxiety
her boyfriend lives in maryland and she lives ny so i am not worried about running into him just want closure so i can move on with my life
so he speeds off and i am calling him while walking to his parents house and in between all that he wrecks his car goes to buy more liquor at a gas station and then gets into the wrong car or whatever and later is arrested and charged with resist arrest without violence and burg unocc veh unarmed
i am obviously not looking for all my problems to be solved here but to just know that others have had these feelings and knowing what you did to get over them would help
i think many of us hoped that this year will be easier and better unfortunately we were wrong and the year was extremely lousy
i am doing ok i am doing a lot of reflecting thinking mindfulness selfwork they did not like him and they wanted nothing with him it makes sense though
i am trying to be productive to keep myself occupied but it does not help and i end up feeling more empty and i just do not want to do anything
often crying at night to the thought of what is wrong with me why can not i stop myself from hurting my body it did not help that i never felt like i could tell anybody what i was going through
the solution to that problem is something that is my responsibility and if i will not solve it if i do not figure out what i need to figure out and get the help i need then that is that
the first friend we will call her a admitted that she had no friends coming out of highschool and would sit at home all day she even told me that she had no one to celebrate her birthday with and watched a movie by herself i was pretty shocked
i want to be in a committed relationship but guys these days do not want that they just want a quick booty call without feelings and i am just not built that way
i you only knew how missing you is going to be the death of meif you only knew i would go to the ends of the earth for you
i really wanted us to work but every time i thought of a future with him it looked bleak and felt bleak
i am just so confused and scared with what to do i realize i cannot help her or any until i do for myself its pointless to even try

a person who has an avoidant personality disorder is aware of being uncomfortable in social situations and often feels socially inept despite this selfawareness comments by others about your shyness or nervousness in social settings may feel like criticism or rejection this is especially true if you are teased even in a goodnatured way about your avoidance of social situations
i am a 19 years old male and i really have no right to be feeling such sadness and pain in my heart i have a beautiful family that loves me no matter what and through the years i managed to build a strong friendship with three people whom i truly trust and care for other than that i also have greatly improved upon myself and have become generally more open and sociable
it is like i could not sleep if i did not cut myself before going to bed i had multiple dreams about this old lady taunting me
in the last 6 years i have hardly interacted with people at times i sort of live vicariously through characters and watching them go through life and make those kinds of important connections in a story is kind of a great pleasure it is also also a great pain in loneliness and old memories
then i woke up stilling wanting to reach out and be there but i can not because i promised i would give you the time and space you need but i am here and i just want to be there for you
will she actually be helpful at all or will she likely just tell me to stop and make me feel bad
i just want to know why i am so fucking lonely why i can not have just one goddamn friend and one fucking girlfriend to give all this bottled up love to
a few years ago i spent a good sum on a gaming laptop so that i would have all the computing power i could possibly need i wanted to upgrade the ram from 8gb to 32gb and to replace the spinning hard drives with solid state memory i carefully watched youtube disassembly videos and my upgrades on this were successful
apparently that morning my ex gf called her friend because she had suspects that something between me and her friend was going on for weeks it was not it was just that night and her friend broke up and told her the truth
it was not until i was walking home that i started to question why i was feeling so low and then i just came to a sad realisation that i keep myself alive for the sake of keeping everyone around me happy i could not bear to end my life knowing that i would brought so much sadness and pain to my family bf and best friend so i keep on going
i have everything to live for an amazing and beautiful family that loves me a boyfriend who treats me right a roof over my head and food to eat

he has not done anything to assure me that i am the only one in his heart and that is all i ever wanted
maybe i attracted people who did not have friends i do not knowthough i have had reoccurring gut wrenching feelings when he talks to other people
it is hard to be there for people when they are at their worst only to have them not acknowledge you when you are hurting i have always been there for people especially because i know what it is like to hit rock bottom but the second i need someone they rather push me aside it is mentally and emotionally exhausting
i look back on all the times i told her that i loved her and how much she meant to me and all the hugs kisses and signs of affection that i offered her over the past 2 years and now wonder when they stopped being mutual
i am lucky enough to have a place with my grandmother for now but after that who knows and i start to imagine my hands covered in blood
sorry for my english i am not a native speakerwith all my live to all the fellow people in heartbreak misery we will be fine
i live in a small apartment in amsterdam with a few flatmates we hang out a few times a week which is nice in a period like this
for me reducing stress anxiety and depression during this holiday season is about eliminating negativetoxic influences and replacing them with positive and healthy ones it also helps by staying present within awareness and being grateful for all that i have without comparing what i had or what i did to celebrate the holidays last year this is vital to ensuring my peace and joy through the season and beyond
again because i broke my conditional i have to stay in custody till i show up in court means the week i was at the hospital was cuffed to the bed
my ex do not want to tell her but everytime i go to see her i am forced to lie to her and she always give me money and it feels really awkward
have you ever split with someone due to circumstances beyond your control and gotten back together how do i know if i met the person i am meant to be with am i crazy or is this normal
this does not get in the way with what i am doing for my self but my mind can not help but to think of her all the time
i asked him if we were ever going to hang out for the 4th time and he gave me a really bad excuse and i said oh come on you can think of something more original he did and that is where it ended
i asked him if he would ever want me back and he said he does not know i have all of this love and the person it is for does not want it
i am writing this because i am concerned about my health and also because i want to try and manage my anxiety
i have been doing a lot of journaling and watching tv to keep my mind off things but when i am not doing those things i feel depressed and like i am not the same person as i was before
for those who are diagnosed or at least in my case it feels like your problems are not that serious when you see everyone especially on social media talking about their depression social anxiety or ocd when they clearly were just a little bit down for a few days are just nervous in social situations or just can not stop to organize things
the late night talk when i look into the distance to see the metro passing by and i am stilled in that moment passing me by and she was laughing of a joke and i thought it was dumb but i was so proud of how she get through her problems to laugh w me
i met my first girlfriend in the new school and after hanging out with her a while i was pretty much immidiately in love for the first time
on the night she told me she loved me she infused me with trust i knew this was someone i was going to build my life with and make a home with because like she said our children would have my eyes meaning we would be a family
the sudden change because the made me quit cold turkey made me go into a manic state and i stayed in longer
it is destructive to your heart its destructive to your soul i feel as if no one cares and notices me like i am invisible or a just a nobody
i decided to talk to her because she was very persistent with talking to me these past 2 years we been separated and right now i am just confused with what i should do
just looking for some reassurance that i can move on even after a year of not exactly doing thati deleted all my pics of her today
just be let go because i have been suffering and it has fully killed me inside i just cannot move anymore
these episodes that i see are repeating every time and bring me to a huge depression feelings i have not be able to solve very well this
no one was looking for meand yet none of it had anything to do with forming any kind of genuine connection with anybody
every day is kind of a struggle to find any meaning in life alone but it is hard anything i do seems in vain as noone will notice my accomplishments
i have kind of stopped really doing much in rl for online stuff 2 cars he woke up one day and decided he did not want to do it anymore
he is going to be another fucking asshole who hurted me and never is going to have any consecuences nothing brings me peace anymore
tldr breathwork can actually change your brain waves and slow down your heart rate in order to boost your mood my favourites are wim hof in the morning and box breathing at night
i just wish that someone out there could hear me cry and help me this is not like you now i have to rebuild my entire life
in addition to this i am also in charge of housekeeping in the office this is not as hard because i am alone there and can manage my time and mess
but the world does not seem the same when you feel that no matter what you are going to be alone in it anyway
but ultimately our relationship got to a point where we would have to be long distance soon and neither of us felt that this is the love of my life i want to marry this person feeling so what is the point of carrying on a relationship where we did not feel like we were going to last forever like i said it is been a month and at first we had no contact
i can not look at myself i refused to be photographed i feel so violated i feel hollow and it sucks because nobody knows i do not want anyone to know i do not want to wake up from nightmares i do not want to just cry on my own and i cannot explain anyone why i am living everyday in the horrors of my mind and my past
i have been having no thoughts which here is the best way i can describe it i have no thoughts until i catch myself having no thoughts which in itself is a thought
when i did not die i was in more pain what kind of fuck up can not even commit suicide properly every day since then has been a struggle
telling them that i got their tools stolen was extrememly stressful for me and their reaction did not really help i do not see any other options i have two and both will be the end of me
when i take walks to relieve myself there are people in my neighborhood who look at me oddly and some even taunt me
all i want is an end to my life i do not know if i can make it too new years eve
which is why i tried to change a lot in my life i was able to stop focusing on my studies due to a stricter planning of my day which resulted in a lot of spare time and i tried to do as many courses as possible at university so i have more time to spare once we got back together
i wish there was a way to fix it but i feel alone even when i am around other people i do not feel wanted and i feel like i am always the backup plan
she did not bother me much until after i moved to be with my wife it is my birthday but i am really feeling down
today i unblocked my ex on social media and everything everything has been going well in my life she gave me money to invest in stocks for our future
i want to die but i know i do not have the courage or the resources to do it i stay up at night and wish that i would die naturally that i would get cancer or any terminal illness that i get into a car accident anything that allows me to die without having to do it myself
she thanked me for being her bestie the explanation for that being is we are the two only bi people in our friend group and we just joke about it a lot
i did it for a couple of years of having casual conversations with girls i did not really talk to many people other than my group of friends which are all guys
just because your sondaughterfathermother is living somewhere else it does not mean you should not check up on them give them a call share a text say a funny joke to them use the facetime feature stay in contact with them
throughout the break he kept flip flopping on what he wanted but always seemed optimistic that we would be able to work things through and grow from the break in my heart i still want him and hope we will end up back together with him but in my head i feel very used and blindsided
it is almost been a year since we last got to really speak to each other and although i still greet him in the hallways i do not think he can ever be that person for me again
i loved her and she did all of that and more now she cries in his tumblr that she is alone sad want to die bla bla bla and that makes me so angry
supernatural got me through the first half of the pandemic watched the entire series before the final seasonthen it was wanting to make sure my family had a good christmas
before i wanted to leave i simply said i am sorry for being a loser and she lost it specific details of the scenario are lengthy but she basically invalidated condescend and ridiculed me
almost 14 years of my life erased i do feel kind of sad especially seeing how close some ppl are to their school friends
i just want her nothing feels like her i am afraid that i will make the move and be even more alone and worse off for it
to make things worse one of my cousins encouraged me to do it i understand that it is not a bad thing but i do not really like doing it
i am complex but i know i have a lot to offer and i think maybe i have been in denial or have not realized that perhaps there is something people are not telling me as to why i am alone
i tried to die at 18 the pain was too much the memories of my past were stronger than the drugs and alcohol
i usually make something up or try to describe physical symptoms but that usually makes my physician tell me i feel that way because of sudden changes in my life i moved started college a year ago then covid happened i mean at this point in 2020 what does not qualify as a sudden change in life and prescribe me a pack of ibuprofen
honey it was all meant to happen to give you experience so when you find the one you find the one who would actually take care of you

pls help me idk how to get this thoughts out of my mind she actually wants me and i know it but these thoughts are ruining me and i want to hurt myself so bad i want to end my life so bad
on friday we had a separate one with my dad both parties had alcohol present but my dad did his best to hide when he was having a beer
scares me a lot but if he is the good guy i know he is he will figure it out on his own
her mother and dad are almost the same like we were she is the more positive kind of person and i was more the negative and realistic person in life
i was lost i broke down in tears and asked him to leave my room and go to his still it hurts
my ex 24m and i 23f broke up almost 2 months now he says he needs to work on himself and find happiness
in one of the endings you can kill yourself and then get a bunch of gut wrenching calls from vs friends
i have not talked about how i truly feel to anyone i have tried and nobody gets it or is willing to stop what they are doing and listen
then i went to college and i have been doing good too almost ready to transfer to another college for my career that is psychology in berkeley
hello i have been dealing with constant paranoia for the past 5 months it is basically the best way to describe it
how do you cope with not talking to someone who you were emotionally dependent on it should not have got that way in the first place the emotional dependence but it did
a wedding of a friend a wedding of someone else or one of my classmates wedding and you near me every time
not sure why though was it because he saw how i was feeling or that it was just impossible to go back to casual i feel like if he was just playing me he absolutely would have strung me along just for sex
how do i continue living when it feels like i do not deserve it i just want her back sohow do i get better without therapy i genuinely do not think i can go on like this much longer
my parents treat depression and being suicidal as crazy and messed up this is why i never told anyone or had a therapist or anything like that
maybe i am not ready for a relationship as of yet and i am just sad and upset but seeing my friends post about their girlfriends makes me feel as if i am losing them
get to know feel understand and trust your body are you fucking stupid those people do not even care oh reddit is not a place for support
i go back to school next week and i am afraid of descending back into these feelings especially since it is still solely online and i do not have my friends and things to keep me going
so after i figure out what is all going on with my dog illness and such then figure what to do about it i am going to kill myself due to many many reasons i have made up my mind it will not happen until near end of january or beginning of february
typing this out i can barely hold it together and i just do not want to feel this anymore i do not want to fucking feel this anymore
i am about to say fuck it to therapy maybe i am too fucked up for even the professionals to handle i do not know
i am stuck between contemplating suicide looking for a way to end my life and getting discouraged by thinking about what happens to my family
with every person i form a friendship with i go through a cycle we get super close get to know each other
so i have a dilemma i am a university student in sydney who has distance cut off toxic high school friends i am finding it incredibly lonely to find friends when i do meet up to hang out with my new friends i feel a sense of shame for having no friends and it makes me really insecure how can i overcome this
earlier today i was browsing and stumbled upon a post about birmingham uk mentally i was thinking of the city in alabama even though the comments were talking about the uk how ww2 flattened buildings and led to newer architecture i still had this assumption that they were talking about the city in alabama i do not know how but soon i came to my senses and realized they were talking about the uk
i might not hav the most perfect face in the world but that does not means i do not deserve any love right
i have been grieving away for half of the month as he has been away with his new girlfriend technically but does not want to admit it staying at her apartment we are both back home today and although he goes back over to her on the weekends i am trying to accept what will move forward
or i look out my window and think of jumping from my balcony it is been only these thoughts and i am tired of fighting it
since that news 2 more of my family members have died which has put my mental health in a slightly worse spot because i feel that i need to support my family who knew these people better than i did
everything just got proven to be so again happiness is not for me but recently my issues have resurfaced mainly obsession with possible health conditions
is unwilling to get involved with people unless they are certain of being liked shows restraint within intimate relationshipshttpswwwwebmdcomsexrelationshipsbhchealthysexlifedefaulthtm because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed
as the title says i feel like i come across people who usually tend to bore me like everyone i meet
her grandmother told me my ex did not feel she could communicate with me and that i was more concerned with pot than growth
i was not sure if i would live to be of age although i roamed him alone because i did not want to see anyone
divorced parent who remained divorced single for all those 26 years and still is check obviously there was so much more i could write but here you go
i spend my days smoking weed and snorting coke without a care its been 2 months since i have interacted with other people besides my mom and obviously my dealer
i have wasted years of my teenagehood that could have gone wonderfully to extremely strict parents and low selfesteem and i fear losing more years as i feel like i am racing through life like it is pure meaningless dust
honestly i just overall feel exhausted like it is always one thing after another with no end then again i was not even all that happy in the end
the intent was here are the happy things i remember from our relationship and hopefully we can find our way back to each other with this compass
he was really pressuring me to move for him and it just stressed me out and i figured i should not feel that way
i miss her a lot and the little things she did i felt it especially when my two girlfriends left me
anyways i accepted it at first but soon after begged her to stay since she was all i really knew for 4 years
she also told my friends that she is missing them she only saw them max 4 times a year when we celebrated birthdays or something similar know i am asking myself if she tries to say that she misses me what do you think
my entire life i have always been secondary my mother was an alcoholic and my dad joined the military while my mom was pregnant with me and was constantly deployed
i think that on the surface i am an excellent friend but i do not feel particularly attached to any of them
i do not know if i could do it without them and that thought is scary i do not want that pressure or responsibility on them
i just feel like i have this emotional dump of thoughts that can not really be spilt anywhere no one else would get it
i am not as smart or outgoing as my brother but i still work hard i am on my own feet and have a masters degree in it
i have been clinically major depressed with high functioning panic anxiety for a long time now a lot of my depression and i mean a lot of it stems from the way i look
i am so lonely that i often times wish i had been given up into an arranged marriage or something like that because then i would have a companion even if i did not love him or he did not love me
i can not say that anything exciting happened to me seems pathetic if you were to check up on me but i am not your problem anymore
similarly i want to help you guys as well not as a compulsion but as a way to bring about some sort of positivity to us both
i need someone who i can laugh and joke with but half the time i just feel like they are judging me or are annoyed bt me and wanting me to leave them alone
still used violence towards me and at some point she picked up an iron rod from the floor and pointed it towards me and sting it a few times at my shoulder
none of these things are things i want and i feel strongly as if my own wants put me in jeopardy with the world and the women around me
that just goes to show how unnoticed i really am and the therapists that i have been seeing had the nerve to tell me just go talk to people lol
i am worried that we will never recover from this year i find at times thinking if we are the crazy ones not having travelled and taking everything too seriously
i just can not help but think well if i am 25 and my life is miserable and nothing works out i will just kill myself and end it
but the world is not ending it keeps turning and with each passing day you are getting better no matter how small a step is taken noticed or unnoticed big or small
and i normally hate receiving help for some reason but love to give help i am tired of running from my past i am tired of never being enough for myself
today i read a book cover that is quite fitting if you would really love me you would eat garlic for me
if like me you have or will be shedding some years over the festive season whether over loss or grief or pain or lonelinessisolation despair conflict compassion or even joy or for no reason you can even fathom why not post here and we can all be in tears together and there is truly no shame in crying when you need to
there is a few reasons one being that i have a lot of emotional baggagetrauma from a past relationship with a history of being cheating on multiple times
my communication skills are getting a lot worse in class i could barely answer questions because i would try and ramble on to get my point across for something that could have been a 3 word answer
this uncontrolable confidence self deceiving energy is tiring i never felt happy it always felt like a mask and i could not get it off
dunno what it means exactly i do not have friends locally even i tend to cuddle and kiss girlfriendsubstitute object online dating is unproductive
this last time i hung out with friends and we got drunk i messaged him asking if i can crash there as i can not drive he said yes i come over and clear a spot on the ground to sit while i am clearing some stuff may as well clean a bit more he lost his shit when i was cleaning
this is all made in the hopes that maybe i can make some sort of small change in the way some people feel but also as a way for me to come to terms with my own loneliness
and to top it all off i have never had a girlfriend and i mean never which has led me to being a virgin
my grandma had it too she would cover herself in yogurt and wrap saran wrap around herself for relief she killed herself
in a way i enjoy the journey and anticipation of traveling to a new place by air to be the only good thing about my vacation
you know what i mean just two old people without energy ultimately living lonely lifes togetheri still feel incredibly guilty about calling the police though which i should
i do not have anyone close enough to tell things to and i can feel everything building up inside and i do not know what to do about it
if i were to kill myself then it would take at least two days for anybody to care enough to come check up on me i can just stockpile my pets with food and water and worst that happens is my corpse will get eaten nobody will miss me i am just a lonely face in a lonely place
and so around halloween i broke up with him due to his lack of communication and the fact that he could not acknowledge or sincerely apologize that all i asked for was some communication like hey i am go pick up my daughter real quick even if i was sleeping
or am i actually just some ugly smelly horrible being that sees itself as human but really am not i feel disconnected from everything
i felt really insecure because i felt like something was off and he revealed that he withheld the truth that he was falling out of love with me for three months or maybe even more
you might say its a drug problem maybe but i was on the same amount of drugs then as i am now
i am currently in a bit of a confusing situation i am going to try and keep this short but it may be a bit of a long story
i will always be angry i was not born pretty i wish i cudve experienced being beautiful having confidence not even knowing to care because i do not carei am asked well what are you going to do after you get plastic surgery it does not matter who cares what i do i will be pretty i will not care i can not wait to know what it is like to be pretty to be happy
in his emotional retreat he starts to shut off even those who are nearest and dearest to him until he finds himself alone in a dense crowd
it hurts to realize that no matter how bad i feel andrew would never come to me if he did not want to
but i just think it is extremely odd i have never been in and the fact that i found out he lived a neighborhood over like a few months ago
we dated a little less than a year and we never got to the i love you stage we cared for each other had a lot of fun and it was a good relationship
i do not even have any energy anymore even now my heads telling me i am doing this for attentionafter a little while he confessed that he was falling for me
also i do not know if i should consider that an attempt because i just wanted to try and faint or see how far i could get
my sense of self is fractured i do not know who i am or what i enjoy no matter where i am or who i am with i feel the profound emptiness that i can never erase
my mother was absent often in her room in her own little world doing illegal things stuff i was not aware of when i was younger
tldr my gf of 8then when i do get with guys the ask me weird sexual fetish questions or if i am trans
he was all bark and no bite but all of the events and the voicemail from august replayed over and over in my head
i am lost here never have i felt so vulnerable in my life i am not a weak person by any means
also i live in india and it is a very backward society we live in if there is anyone from india heshe will understand
i am an awful dancer and i know you do not want one but the first dance will be so perfect too have the eyes on us as i hold and dance with you and we just look at eachother with a smile and pure love
with so many people in the world you are virtually guaranteed to meet someone who is a good match in the future if that is your goal of course
i started engaging in self destructive activities at age 13 and it has carried itself through my life up until now almost 17
i did three years of psychotherapy with some limited results however due to it being such a long slow and highly expensive process i am now looking for other options
i tend to do this when i am feeling anxious in public worried about confronting someone or just can not concentrate at uni
i feel like i ruined every opportunity i had to get my shit together and be a better person i have lost all my friends the support of my family
but slowly he kind of fell out of it and started acting distant i thought he was depressed again so i tried lifting him up
i told him that he is the only one i picture myself growing old like that with we spoke about trying things again and even even shared secret i love you
i am still hoping my oldest friend would find some value in me but the fucked up fear is that i wasted years on a person who deeply disliked me
this is not enough for me reguradless of weather they accept this or not how after knowing this after being so clueless about it am i supposed too
in my dreams i seem to be conscious of the fact that she left me but also in the dreams she will say she loves me or tell me she wants to hang out again
or the thoughts will linger nonstop i want to die my life is so mundane and the only person who would care is my mother
this last part is for my ex and it is something i want to say to you but will not because what good will it do me
overall i realized i had a life before her and it is at fun one at 37 i wanted her in my life i definitely do not need her it is nice to have the worry and heartache leave so take care people i hope this help but as the old saying goes time heals all wounds i still have some self healing to do but i am loving the process
out of college i spent some time wandering around aimlessly and thought of asking for guidance with one of my teachers
i do not know i feel like i need to stress about something even if it is a minor issue bc that is all i have ever know is to stress
did not last long because she came back and texted me and after some talking we got back together which was a mistake because little did i know i would be in the same situation again a few weeks later but all things happen for a reason and i can not change the past but i wish i never met her because all she is done is make my life even more miserable she hurt me emotionally and it hurts like hell knowing someone else will be getting all her love and attention
i feel inside the best thing would be to leave because i am getting sick of being treated like this but i feel like that means i am giving up on our family
if i knew some of the people better i would be able to have a better conversation but my work is making that almost impossible with the amount of traffic store changes and turnover
i do not miss school as i nevr had that many friends btu it just fels so lonely i just think of my fictianal husbands and wish they were there by me making me feel welcome and pampered but i hate my family my mom will not let me get discord ever agian i fel traped and cramped twitter and redit are my only escapes to flee from the dark halls
i know i am not the only one feeling this way but i am sick of not having friendsnot much to say i just wanted to say hello
out of those 5 modes of connection how many of them were you connected to with that individual write down how many of them they were connected to you as well
in april it will have been a year since he told me our marriage was over and left it was a messy divorce one that i fought so hard not to have
i do not know what to do right now and i do not want to think i am barely making it to work now and i been stuck here for a while
and because i am so depressed i start doing extremely illogical things like for example texting my 8 year older ex who i dumped she was very sweet to me but obviously it was all just when i was still of value to her after that she does not give a fuck about me
in practice letting go would look something like this when you are feeling down or even like you are going to cry find a place somewhere where you will not be disturbed for instance a bedroom or a car
i am not sure where to go with this and quite honestly i feel like a lunatic in a way please give me time to get this out
i spent the last 3 months exploring ideas on what could we do next so that is what i have to give her i have to let her go because i love her
we connected after highschool we had the same classes but never talked until we started dating so he knows all of my friends and i know his
just know that these feelings are expected so do not be eager to judge them or beat yourself up just let it go it is all about letting it go
it is funnier to think about that he always use to tease me that i am only in love with him for the things he would do for me
i have friends and family that care about meand love me but coming home and going to sleep on a two person bed by yourself feels awfulsome of my friends are in a relationship and i am happy for them but also a tiny bit jealous
i have friends and still feel lonely there is people who think i am pretty and i can not even look at myself without crying my eyes out
over time as our relationship got more serious she told me she does not like it when i make jokes of every thing and i need to be more serious and open about my emotions
pls i need someone i know that when i kill myself no one will notice i just stopped talking to a friend after they told me some nasty things they were the only one left and now i am alone with my 9mm and the urge to blow my brains out
i miss my ex gf so muchshe already has somebody else and it is been a couple months since we broken upbut i do not blame her i was so shitty to heri fucked up with her like i do with everything
however now i feel as there is not effort she replies every 67 hours and sometimes she does reply multiple times in an hour
someone older as men my age were too embarrassed to commit like it was uncool i have been home for about 6 months now and its really getting to me
it sits there as a reminder that i can get away from all this shit whenever i want and without pain
there is nothing going for me and it seems there never will be the only thing keeping me here is a fear of what is on the other side
today i was left by someone i held so close and so dear to me a person i imagined my future with someone i gave my whole heart and soul to
what adds up to that is i still feel like the same person like i did not develop other skills or learned nothing new
i do not know if this is the right place to post this please guide me if it is not and they all look at me like i am not one of them
alway it is your fault so live with those things i am tired to stay with you we done i am not dating anyone i just want to break up with you but 1010 times i found she already have new supply before broke up with me
we only dated a month which feels pathetic and is actually the shortest i have ever dated someone which is odd considering i am not in high school but it felt like forever
i have had to get over the same girl in the past and its a very shitty feeling but here i am experiencing it all over again
at 1415 years old i had episodes of depression and was spiraling out of control i was selling drugs to survive and was being abused by my teacher i told no one even my sister i just told her i got it from side jobs it never was i had no heart to tell it felt like something i needed to do bury the emotion and just fucking survive i kept telling that to myself
at this stage i would be disappointed to learn that it was not considering it was so much to clearly ruin your own childs life over
life makes no sense when you have no one and i am not talking about interactionsdeprivation i am talking about the lack of meaningful and genuine connections and relationships in your life you can have some interactions even daily they can even be with cool honest people that helps to some degree sure but ultimately i felt completely pointless this was just totally nonsensical
the day that we broke up i actually thought things were getting better i asked her to come home and told her i was tired if fighting over small things
i really want my life back anyone know how i can help my mental state i am a finance student and have a lot of big goals in my life
i have some sense of this all not really being real as i am i know that the hallucinations are not real but they look real so therefore it is really scary and i often have to close my eyes and stay really still
as someone who tried ending it twice within the span of a year my worst regret is waking up the next day still alive
but now my parents have installed parental spyware on every device but this one and it is only a matter of time before the get it on this
after the embarrassing moment i had at christmas dinner my family as been trying to be supportive to the best they can be i just still feel lonely and wish i can break from it i am started to push people who care about me away
we are living at my parents both of us unemployed and without a chance to get employed no respectable experience no career path and this damn virus my only dream is to get the fuck out of here to my wifes home country but it will take months to get my visa and then there is the virus not the optimal time for a move is it it feels like i am going to be stuck here forever
for a long time i could not make that decisioni feared two things the possibility of happiness and the impact my suicide would have on others
is officially the worst day of the year for me my last and only friend blocked me and it is all my fault i have loved him so much for two years it is also five years since my ex blocked me i love him to
i always admired him when i was a kid he was the type of guy walking around in cannibal corpse shirts and longs hair
i am starting to feel nothing and when i do feel something it is often anger or sadness i was not sure how much this bothered him despite him telling me it was fine
that you do not look for their family friends or their car while your driving that you do not look at their social media once in a while
do not take these things so seriously i miss you so muchi feel like life is throwing me every curve ball it can throw at me
giving an equal third to each of my parents who are divorced and one special woman who for some reason does not understand my advances
but he has not and it is been two months he does not care about me he does not love me like he used to
i have been a misfit for all my life but for the first time i am tired of trying to fake that i am like anyone else i am not nothing that peoples are seeking in lifes corresponding to what i truly desire
i was going to ask for advice here but i do not see what you guys can do i think this is more of a vent than anything
long story short my 13 yo daughter has suffered from suicidal ideation for three years i have tried to do everything and anything to help her she is been in therapy for as long and to protect her and to be a good mom to her by always listening and being open and talking to her amongst loads of other ways i have tried to be a good mom and do the right things by my children but i reckon i have been shit because i have just found some very disturbing things that she is into she is a writer and writes fan fiction that is straight up sex smut
i know you say that if we did not break up that we would still have our problems but like i said if i did not have this wake up call i would still be stuck in my own fantasy of us i want to put in more effort but what is the point if you are not putting in that same effort what do you want
she slept with other men and was a dom for a living since she was previously his trophyhousewive and that is how she got herself up and out of the marriage
i have a boyfriend but i am thinking of leaving him because i feel so so ugly i am told i am beautiful pretty and whatever by others but i cover so much up
can you let go of your ex without hatred anger or bitterness if so can you also learn to appreciate your time together as well as the hardships you endured till now if so how
is not it easier to just blame myself for the horrible things that happened even if it was out of my control sometimes i think i could have done something to prevent it i could have done better i could have done something
i want him out of my life but this game hes playing is against my life its put another financial burden on me since i have a limit per month for my insurance to get the medications and it might pass the limit to replace the one out of ten i require
ever since quarantine i have become more insecure about my fat rolls and the fat under my necki am not fat by any means but i have a bit of chub
i have no problems of deactivating my social media account as i do not use them often but what holds me back is our memories in them if i go they will all be gone and nothing will be left
the issue is that now it is gotten to a point where i am slowly loosing interestfeelings for her as our interests hobbies and personalities do not line up together
one day enough was enough i had a public meltdown in front of the whole school at this point i did not talk to anybody for 8 months and probably will not for the next 4
so i was going back and forth from my mums and today i started to tackle the pile of my belongings he viciously threw haphazardly
i m so fucking lonely and desperate that i make up stuff just to start conversations it is annoying it is come to a point where i m not realising that i m actually doing it
tonight a girl i am friends with spoke about a guy she had a crush on who had been in australia for the past few months and was now coming back to our city she said i hope he is been fucking as many girls as possible so that his staminas better
i feel this intense longing for him i do not know how to get out of this headspace this tells me she wants to keep going
i hated them all i felt management was pathetic and the customers had literally one brain cell between all of them
he was chill but uninterested so i could never find how to talk with him 3 years later though this great earthquake happened and we lost the place between rubble
i am just saying that i can not find people to relate to not a lot in my personal experience in this sub
note i have always been a quiet kid i am not a talkative person very calm i am very reserved and i love spending time alone which i think is very important
i have never been much of a joiner i have always preferred the company of a good book or movie or taking long walks
i am probably not going to be alive for much longer and i am sorry for roping any of you into this sad story but i thought i should say something before i die
i think about the role my depression might play in this maybe i am just overanalyzing my behavior but beeing depressed since i was a kid has definitely changed me so idk about that tbh
nobody actually cares about me anymore depression hurts physically my headaches are such a tight feeling its like my heads being squeezed
i lied to him and i was referring to my boyfriend as my ex i told him i am not ready for another relationship because i have feelings for my ex
i can not sleep without dreaming of being with her only to wake up in a cold room alone i can not focus on school i am distancing myself from family i feel alone
the sad part is that i do not hate the guy and never didwe agreed it is finally time to let go of one another it is killing me
he is a repeat offender and can not stay out of prison so he was not around to assist me or split the responsibility of taking care of our mother together
it would be easier for my family maybe i would not be the same person but id be alive they would not have to mourn me it would be like a whole new person that person would be better then i ever could be
so my ex i broke up in february i am 19 and he was 22 and i guess i am still not over it
i have no one and i am so tired of being alone all the time but i do not want any toxic types like people who do drugs use substances because it seems like alot of people do that what do i do
i was supposed to go to england to get a job and try to make a better life but my friend who was like a brother to me whom i knew since kindergarden years sorta backstabbed me and that did not work out either he was supposed to help me start he already had a life there
there she was talking for hours each day with that guy and she wants to settle down for days i could not eat or sleep
i always feel so tense it must be why my neck and my back ache sometimes but i just can not relax idk why i always feel like something bad is going to happen and i always need to be alert the only time when i feel relaxed is when i am surrounded by my pillows and i am under a blanket
i always have my back against the wall when walking through a hallway i dash up the stairs and have this
i lied to everyone about me because i was afraid i just feel paini lost almost everyone because i am a lierand i just can not deal with it
i would like to share a quick trick to stop being lonely if you are picky about people with which you are happy to interact
to start off i was born in a nice sized town on the east coast of the united states state being maryland my father fell in love with my mother and had me and my brother who is a year younger my dad has money he worked hard from 16 to now still working hard my mom well she was a wonderful person until i hit about 6 years old randomly one day we left not my brother just me and her to a run down city in the same state turns out while in college she picked up a drug addiction and cheated on my father
but just the thought of him being with someone else i also saw this coming so why am i feeling so bad over this why can not i accept it is over why do i feel so bad that you know he could have worked it out with me and stayed with me and it would have been okay but he did not
i need love too i need someone who would care for me for my entire life since i started realizing what is love i have always been craving for it
i can not visualize a future for myself i have nothing left to give and it is getting harder and harder to pretend like i am doing okay
and let us backtrack to me looking heterocheck out this meetup with life beyond breakup divorce support group httpsmeetupsejdh0cnvjhkdgod it was so complicated
i have tried giving him space it did not work i have tried being affectionate it did not work either i have tried going to my moms for a weekend and it got even worse but somehow he says he needs more space
in particular many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that it is not so bad and this is usually experienced as i do not understand what you are going through and i am not going to try
is there anything you guys do mentally or even physically to shift your mindi was married for 10 years when i turned 19
for now sleep is the next best thing until i finally enter this permanent state of unawareness in an eternal abyss of nonexistence
i do not even know what i want anymore i just feel so numb to these doctors appointments i have to go to for her i question am i doing enough or not how can i do enough when i am depressed and numb as ever just sitting on the couch watching her do the same things over and over and over
i hust feel like ill be stuck being useless forever my guardians a medical worker so she has no time especially nowadays to wait around for me to go into and get off work there is no way for me to make any money
but when the lockdown in our city was lifted she was out with the group of friends she posted it on her snapchat
you are now living happily in another country and i was the one who broke it off but recently i have realized how much i miss you as person not just me wanting a relationship
i began to reminisce in my own thoughts and i began to think about my life i feel dissociated with others and find comfort in one person
i also pick at the hair on my body more specifically my legs and will use tweezers to pick at them i think i am convinced i am going to get ingrown hairs
i hate the idea of being forced to spend time with family when you fucking hate them i hate the hypocrite smiles and fake wishes and that everyone just pretends that nothing is ever wrong because oh is christmas
but i have this feeling in my gut that i will not be alive come january 1 what if something has happened to him how am i supposed to react i feel like shit
i had never done anything like this in my life it was completely against my morals it was the hardest most embarrassing thing i have ever done but it should not be
i just want to be able to think clearly and make rational decisions again without feeling completely stupid and to be able to stay awake during the day or anything like that it also totally dumps on my motivation and impacts my mood and interactions with others any help is appreciated
it makes me wonder if this is a life worth living i believe it is a waste to live without any special connections in your life that is one thing i would trade everything for just to have someone understand me and be there with me
at this point i could not i love him like crazy and we live in the same house i hate that they were the ones to see me at my rawest
that he is the one i have waited all my life for it does not even matter in what capacity but i just need him in my life
it is difficult for me to cut off come to think about it we were not a good match but still we are too much involved in our lives and i still have feelings for him
introvert can not talk to people for dear life can not find a job and gets rejected everywhere could not be accepted into college is told all i ever do is draw those kitties mind keeps swirling into all of the wrong directions and now this
i 20f have recently gone through a breakup with someone 24m at first we were friends and then we started a relationship and things were great
next year i am going to be in other city and hopefully better also do not do the same mistake i made do not put yourself before someone else sorry for the bad english and hope you have a wonderful day
that me not being around the house is fucking with her but you know that the only reason i did that is because we never really talked about anything
if anyone experience this please tell me what to do i want to stop this i lived my entire life isolated and lack of attention
i felt like i was the normal one and that it was everyone else that was weird but as i grew older i realised that i was the odd one out
i was told at 14 that i was a man and god will start judging me i studied many religions and left all religion and no longer believe in god i am 18 now
he was 14 and for anyone that had coached or taught you know you have a certain kind of care and love for your players
2 weeks ago i broke up with him in a letter because i am chicken and knew it would have went bad if i did it in person
about a month later her mom drops her off at my house and she hangs out at my house for about three days
is it okay to want nc and demand that i stay blocked what should i dothings are going hard i am struggling so much i have ran out of tears
not wanting to sound pessimistic but i feel tired and burnt out after successive one sided love or affection but certainly not infatuation
when i am not extremely depressed about my family i am depressed about the end of my last relationship due to ocd or the end of college graduated online this semester after withdrawing due to ocd in fall 19 i have no avenues to socialize as i do not have contact with high school people college friends are scattered hours away
luckily for me the felony was downsized to a mista meaner and i only served 6 months and was released on house arrest
i just needed a place to type this i do not know what to do and i am scareda rare live video of alan watts giving a lecture while shooting arrows
he is blocked me on everything even venmo and tik toki just came out of a 2 yr rlts 4 days ago
i was going to hang myself tonight while my pregnant girlfriend slept we live in her dads garage i have been dealing with the stress of being a good father and realizing i do not know what i am doing the only car i had to my name was destroyed by mechanics that i stupidly trusted 2000 down the drain
hey all i started a podcast while in isolation with my immediate family where i call a friend and have a long talk my first long episode is up with a therapist who gives advice on maintaining emotional health during the crisis we are in
no one hires me not even a cafe or bar because i do not have a degree yes here you need a degree to work as a waiter or bartender
i have tried to change my mindset and think of it as solitude and not isolation or lonliness but i can not fool myself anymore
i have been stuck inside for the past 910 months and honestly it feels like a portion of my life has past by because of it
it was at this point that shit really hit the fan and started a pretty difficult time for all involved while he was considering leaving his fiancé for me and thinking everything over
i do not think i will ever be that happy again he was so special and there is nobody else like that and now it is just over
this also happened in middle school where i was severely bullied and in high school were i almost completely shut myself out of everything because i was afraid
i always get irrationally sad sometimes i cry and when i do it is uncontrollable i do not know why these special occasions make me feel so shitty and down
it is just my own observation on my own self i do not say that my expirience is appliable to other people but i wanted to share this thought as i believe it is something not only me but someone else has too
when does a habit become an addiction or an addiction become a disease and how exactly do various chemicals and drugs themselves because a disease process in only those specific addictions is gambling addiction a disease even though there are no drugs involved does that make it a disorder as opposed to a disease what is the difference habit addiction disorder disease what do each of these words mean more importantly what do they look like in the brain
he is also been sneaking this person in at night which makes me super uncomfortable on so many levels copd emphysema she kept smoking and one morningshe set herself on fire while smoking with her oxygen on
it is important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed
i said that this is not how i am with my guy friends and his response was well maybe you just do not have many good friends and i said i am glad i never introduced anyone if that is his attitude
i am hearing from friends that she loves me very much and wants to try again sometime in the future and that she wanted to marry me but if we got back together we would need to start afresh
as the title suggests loneliness is creeping once more closer to me a lot of factors hit me right now as this year is drawing to an estranged ending for personal reasons i want to keep my identity except my name which is alexander secret
i have everything i have ever wanted in the face of my two beautiful healthy boys my amazing wife that is such a good person money security a lot of free time i am not an employee and i can stay at home do whatever i want for as long as i want
i have been trying to wait out this virus at my job that makes me want to kill myself even more than i already do because if i leave and we shut down i am fucked i am tired of being guilted there and treated like shit by clients and the company not giving a shit about employees not even my boss cares the clients always want to take their mask off or take
i do not know why i did it but i did not want him to get a false impression besides i have not seen him in forever by that time and it was just i did not want to make it awkward the perfume guy is also into me so i guess i felt kind of bad about it
everything happens for a reason as cliche as it soundsyou are beautiful in your own way your own damn way we spoke for 5 months she told me all about her boyfriend how he a cop
i have spent years trying to convince myself that it is not my fault for being born this way and it is not my fault for being in that kind of situation but it is hard to remember that when the people you love family members etc always remind you and pick on you because of it
and to be fair i should have seen the signs he used to ignore me to talk to her and a lot of stuff like that
things felt like they were getting better and i enjoyed the time i had until this last saturday just like that it all hit me
do not give up on people do not give up on yourself your more than them then i see my exs pic she posted on ig
i grew up here but i have never actually took the time to visit this place and enjoy it long story short two life guards came by and said i am not supposed to be here because it is holiday
she even made out with her friend i had sex with then we were sitting next to eachother we were physical touching and caressing
the one who brings out insults and criticisms to the world around who takes good ideas and twists them giving you bad ideas and complaints
i want to say everyone here wish you a merry christmas i am still single and alone and still have little hope for the future and definitely there are people out there who feel the same
sorry for the long rant surprisingly that is the short version i just do not have anyone to talk to i just feel like a big chunk of me is missing and it really hurts
i have dated a few guys but it has not turned out well even though we are good no ill feelings i do not think i can call them friends
i just do not know what to do or how to feel anymore i reach my arms out to touch it but it disappears
now i am disabled to travelling is not simple neither are funds but in 2011 i went to her country to meet her we fell in love
having big disabilities is not the only thing that makes people no getting love leading me into a situation for the past ten days or so that has me contemplating very strongly
basically i have so much i want to learn and i hate how my loneliness is preventing me from being productive i try my best to work and study and i even put on music or news in the background to make it seem as if there are people near me however i end up anxious and video call loved ones for hours then it is time to sleep and i am behind on all my goals
30 yo male with a baby on the way good work living good great wifebut been having dark thoughts suicidal images and no will to live
i left college i have gained weight i am not doing anything since quarantine started i am in this dark place that i just can not get out it is been like this for years i try to get better but it just does not work life does not work for me
they can go out and ball all day with their friends and go to the movies with their girls right afterward
that they cry over the person i am in love with has all but made me feel that i should just do it
4 i do not agree with the selfish argument it is not selfish to die it is selfish to demand someone to continue to suffer if someone had terminal cancer i know this is slightly different you would let them die if that was their last wish
happy holidays 25m here currently finishing up watching ww84 after 6 shots of jameson started sertraline a week ago but low dose antidepressant 3 now
i told him we needed to block eachother to prevent either of us from reaching out in moments of weakness and inevitably causing more pain
to the redditor who loaned me 50 and i could not repay due to my situation going from horrid to deadly i am going to try and sell my chromebook today to pay you back as my last act of always keeping my promises to people in this life
at that moment a voice within me said with an australian accent idk why what the actual fuck mate she is clearly a fucking maniac and you are better without her stop trying to get her back and just ignore that bitch pick your crown king and i knew at that moment i was over her
i feel like i am incompetent or that somehow it is my fault i am hoping in time he will realise alcohol and drugs will not love him back like i did
then you can never go home all i have is my brother but if i leave then he is at home too
is there anyway i can make him feel old feelings is there anything i can do that can open his heart back up to me i know he cares for me and is attracted to me
she said she feels scared whenever she has that feeling and admitting she shuts down whenever she feels that women like to feel desired just like men and rightly so
the truth was there and our friendly loving activities have been permanently poisoned i can not cuddle a girl who does not love me
when i was making all those sacrifices i thought i was doing it for a better future but is the future really better if i end up alone and rich and miserable
i thought maybe she was still going through what she was going through but when the lockdown in our city was lifted she was out with the group of friends
i did not text him yesterday he texted me early this morning i just want to say thank you for everything you have done for me more than anyone has in a long time you are amazing and i am sorry things did not work out guess we are just too different and i am kind of a bitch about things i will try to work on that and my depression thank you so much
at some point these giant doors to the reservoir of apathy and resignation opened a bit and then opened a bit more
it is hard to realize these people or institutions that are meant to help you actually make your pain worse i genuinely do not mean to discourage anyone please go to therapy and try it out for yourself if you feel like you might benefit from it this is just my experience
i do not have many friends and my family does not talk to me so i did not have a good place to go
when i am not getting this it makes me feel worthless and lonely life is just better when you have someone you can cuddle with
she had been telling me for months she had lost the feelings the once had when she first brought it up i begged her to stay and we would work on it
i miss her so fucking much but i do not miss what we had or what we could have been it is weird i just do not understand myself anymore
i made same mistakes everyday in filling exam details during examinations for 36 papers i wrote roll no wrong or sometimes i wrote my book code wrong or sometimes paper set wrong i made same mistake for 36 times in 7 days i was embarassed and depressed
the toughest walks are always done alone because only after that we will reach a different place as a different person to meet better people
at first i thought i caught feels and them leaving made me think that but now after some thought it is just company i miss having people to talk to
but they did not offer an alternative we juststopped just sitting there doing nothing occasionally hearing someone breathe or move something on their end
so taking care of my cat made me feel like i had a purpose i would have a reason to wake up in the mornings be happy playing with her and so on
i have bpd and i ruin my relationships every fucking time i can not fucking take it and i am ready to just fucking give up and die
i am all by myself never even had sex yet not like any girl would want me though i look like steve buscemi
there was only a two month gap between these two relationships which was pretty silly as i was still healing from past traumas but i just felt this guy was too good not to give a chance
selfish teenage kid that should not have anything that is what my mom repeats to me every second of everyday cuz i can not build up the strength to do anything cuz she always tell me i do not do anything right can not live anymore i am not sorry i am fucking done and no ones going to stop me 13 fucking 13 and of can not even handle the pain i am so numb i am give up goodbye
now i am 10 months post break up from my last relationship and i know that i would never want to be with him again in reality but i can not help but romanticise what could have been everyday i have no urge to get back with him in any way but every day i wish we had never have broken up
he is had his heart broken i think i am in love with him but he is gone he has a prettier girlfriend that lives closer
i went to the restroom and came back to them sitting next to each other faces very very close and holding hands on the table and he was rubbing his thumb across her hand
it was cleared up where the confusion came from and she at least understood3 this would not good look to my family they would not approve
i keep making bad choices like i do not know better drinking to much during the week having the wrong priorities calling in sick when i feel like it literally things you would do as a teen when still going to school
i trusted him i never had any loyalty concerns i constantly thought of them i went nowhere i do not have a boyfriend or a partner to this day
so i decided to no contact her anymore about two weeks ago since that i started to feel free and like getting back the control of myself and my feelings
and i thought we were both on the same page we decided to start looking at houses and furniture and talk about what our plans were
i have no access to a gun and i do not want to run in front of a car and traumatize another human
i just thought he should know about it i had to leave my two dogs behind i am just so fucking crushed
i failed and got kicked out of college i do not have anyone to talk too and its been really lonely i been struggling financially
and i am sad because after all this if someone does not love me then i must be the most unlovable person on this planet
it is been months and i still can not move on i still have feelings and i honestly think it is because deep down i know i could go back to him i know he would take me back and i hate it why can not he just hate me so i can move on and forget about him
however as someone who loves to learn i do not want to simply be treated and cured i want to be a part of my own growth so the other two resources i have set for myself are
i find myself crying and hiding in my room or distracting myself when he is busy because i really wish i could talk to him all hours of the day not even just when i am feeling anxious
one mentioned how bizarre it was that she never even went out for her 19th birthday and everyone was shocked and all i could think was how i never went out for any birthday
everyone is counting on me to do the best i can to do really well in collegei had a hard time conversing with everyone
why do i hate doing nothing with people when everyone else seems to like it what is wrong with me i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder but neither of those have hate togetherness as a symptom as far as i know
i do not know if anyone will respond to this but i thought i would try thank you my screen time is almost 7 hours a day
i am not on this sub to get tips on how to circumvent these decisions in a practical way but rather here on how to best deal with the inevitable feeling of being alone in life
looking at families who are just being silly hearing the screaming of toddlers have you ever felt sad just like i did at the sight of your family conversing like any family would have you ever felt isolated when you dished out some jokes talked to some one tried to act like any perfectly functioning person would have you ever felt like an actor trying to pull out a convincing play
i have interests but they are expensive and i do not have the money or skill required to engage with them to my satisfaction watching videos about them would be nice if it was not for the fact that it makes me so sad to watch them because i can not do that so now that i am done failing school for a semester all i have is watching youtube videos from sunup to sundown
4 months ago i thought i would die without my ex the pain was too much but now look at me i am excited about life and love
you have hurt my heart several times already and you would have broken my heart eventually because you were far too weak and fucked up to be worthy of a relationship with me but i could have never imagined you simply abandoning me in such a way and leaving me so devestated
i eventually moved out and back with my mom in april and things were so toxic at the end we never had the talk
he did not love me yet i had always hoped and told me he does not know if he could let himself love me due his own previous heartbreak issues scared of getting hurt his favourite sentence
during the relationship we got very close and got along perfectly we only had one argument over the entire relationship and besides that we were great together
i tried to get a restraining order against stepdad where him and my mom tried to use my own medical records to show my mental diagnosese made me lie which it does not
fantasy man fantasy man remember toe sketches in the sand the q and a with a heart as a band fantasy man fantasy man the mexico sun and the lake at our side the sand pits that sat under shady tree lines let us go traveling in that van fantasy man fantasy man
i asked her how she grew up with her family bec there might be a connection as to why she is being ambivalent
and finally when i did it backfired hopefully this was not too long and hopefully this is the right place to post this
by 16 i was taking care of my mom and the whole housethanks for listening i just really need someone to talk to or give me some advise
not all that different for me have built up a pathetic collection of rilakkuma bears there are a tons of reasons behind that not the place to write them down here
making me unable to connect with other people and that was true last time i cried in that moment was years ago and also was the because to all of my insecurities
nobody really noticed and i went to a different physician a few days afterwards saying i could not get out of bed was feeling nausenauseous and having headaches
i am stuck i am not managing to find a solution because logically speaking i am at a dead end how the fuck am i supposed to feel happy if i can never physically do what i loved doing if speaking with other people can not fill the emptiness that that creates if i generally do not feel anything
seeing your face just makes me feel kind of cold and shivery inside like falling into a pool in the spring instead of the summer though
so i was feeling absolutely out of my mind the passed week or two when a new doctor sent me home w medicine i was already taking but w an increase from 350 to 450mg
i am in the courting stage of a relationship and i worry if i text too much what she likes about me if i am too socially awkward etc and i am just confused at what mental illness i even have
i have slowly been losing motivation to put in effort and she does not seem to notice sometimes i would send a dry response and would be left on read
john also has mental health problems and has had them worsen too over this year but my bf stayed by me took care of me and encouraged me throughout it all
i know this letter might be confusing since i said i do not want to stay in contact especially because our last conversation ended on a sour note
it really saddens me because all of my progress and potential everything that i have worked up to will be for nothing
you succeeded in making me give up on you i wish you had not but its amazing how much you did to change my mind
just as the year before that which was the same as the year before that and the prior years were exactly like that too
nobody knows how bad i feel especially about loosing the gift card i literally got sick and threw up i beat myself up over it so much more than anyone else could nobody cares how much i am hurting i am just pathetic he has been telling everyone how bad his christmas was
we were getting better we were connecting more and now that he cut the wires and showed literally no empathy love or care i get it
i created this is reality because i wanted to make a docuseries that the online community can relate to not only that the online community motivates the narrative we will hear real raw stories that will impact others on a level like never before give a shared space to show that you are not alone but learn what others go through especially for the twitch community 3
i have been job hunting for a whole year and so i far i have not encountered anything that pays nearly as much as my current job does do not be fooled tho my income is less than 7000 a year thirdworldcountryprobs and it is just so draining
just knowing that i was a social outcast and that i did not give myself the chance to live a better life is heartbreaking for me
there is no i belonging starts with discarding that vantage point the importance of the self to time and place it was born into into that you is yet another you that you see you feel can you feel it and i i am you
and now this is even worse than the break upfor so long that now 2 months later i am still trying to guess
mostly i just feel like the last man on the world now when before i had dozen of online friends i would interact with in a community
what is the point of being so smart so good at so many things so f special if i feel so underachieving such a waste of potencial and i already given up on all my dreams not because i feel they are not achievable anymore i just feel there is no point
nobody listens to me and i just feel like a burden everywhere i go and that they would better off if i was not there
some amount of resigned apathy did flow in i do not always feel apathetic but it does occur from time to time
then in october i fell on the ice in the same place and could not walk for a day in a half and i could not feel my legs
i have had been a very depressive person attempted a suicide once at my 16 and ended up being hospitalized at a madhouse but discovered cannabis and since i used it everything started to make sense
it makes me so paranoid and the more i try to ignore it the more it brings up negative thoughts and suicidal thoughts it just pisses me off so much and there is no way on earth i can talk to them about shit like that
we just had a little boy 2 month ago an you would think the last two months would be the best 2 mount of my life well no the complete opposite
it might be a bit scary but i create still lives of my own loneliness it helps me to think and recognize my own thoughts maybe it works for you too
it was a very hard decision for her and even harder for me to accept not even sure i still accepted it
but if i can just get someone to understand me just for a few moments then maybe this will not all have been for nothing i am done
where i am forced to be professional and not really speak my mind not to do fun stuff when there is no people to talk to or to fill that void when i am alone with my thought
but i know he needs this time a space for his mental health edit i meant crazy in the title thought it meant the same thingi hate this
i feel nothing nothing at all everything feels like a massive task if something requires effort i do not do it i do not know why
i am tired of videogames my hobbies are not profitable i do not have friends and at this point i do not want to have any
i am often suggesting activities i totally gave up when i suggested something and my friends went out and did it without me
i was happy but today i do not feel like today is a special day for me that was easily the worst time of my life
at nights whilst sharing the same bed she would turn herself away and choose to text other men while i having just finished apologizing cried myself to sleep
in august i finally got a therapist and when i came out with eveything that happened things i had not even told my own family i had a psych break and i was never the same
i thought i had made a friend but she soon left me for some others and it hurt tbh my old friends are drifting away from me too so i just feel really lonely
just sucks and i stilll do not know what kind of jobcareer i am going for it does not help that i am really anxious at the same time about meeting people
the girl i loved years ago in with the same man she left me for and my best friend ghosted me a year ago
if anything my weekend job has become my only chance to socialise with others i do not have any close friends that i would be able to see regularly you see
no matter how hard everyone around me tries to make me happy i always stay negative i have not felt truly happy in years
i just want to vent everything out i can not kill myself but i also can not go on i am just stuck
you may have seen pictures of this where you see these beautiful pots that have been put together again through gold dust and you can see the lines almost like veins in a pot and the philosophy behind this is that it is trying to help us realise that that we need to embrace our flaws
no answer for a few hours never happened before even if we do not exchange a lot since the break up two month ago
i told her that her depression was starting to wear me down i told her that i thought she could do a better job of dealing with her issues and i brought up therapy because she has mentioned it in the past and that she wanted to start going again well this was not the right time to bring that up
i am a woman i have bpd that mental illness where everyone is thinking your a manipulative liar despite the disorder mostly being brought on by trauma and an emotionally invalidating environments i struggle with alcohol and self esteem etcetera ecetrea
i do not understand why i react this way why i feel this uncontrollable anger this gutwrenching anger at nearly anything that makes me feel in a negative way
i get bullied constantly which to be honest not a big deal i do not know why i just can not stop it
we have broken up for a week at a time and he did not even bother to try and talk to me yet i do know he does love me he just does not know how to act or what to do with all that is upsetting me no matter how many times i try to communicate with him and tell him
how can i tell my best friend which i am not the bf of this person that i am suicidal on christmas that i give up
i feel so bad and angry with myself i still feel like i have the same social intelligence as i did when i was a kid i can not handle any stress at all if it involves other people being mad or disappointed in me i can not handle it i can not handle this
we met in october 2019 but that was to give me my lost watch he found it we both attend community college for the time being due to college being so expensive
i have been struggling with self harm for 3 years now i have been through 10 months of phphospitalsioptherapyresidentials and medications
just little things the way i am i just want the inner turmoil to stop so i can finally be at peace
i remember when my friends came to me asking for relationship advice i always helped but after our convo ended i always told myself
it is not invalid it is very valid but i am seeing it too much and i wanted to mention how i feel about it
so unpleasantly i had to move back home with my wife and mother in law where my mother finds fault in everything
i am 27 now and looking back on my life after this discussion with my therapist i am realizing that ocd has likely been with me for a very long time way before 27
i guess i feel heart broken naturally i will not discourage this because it is good it is also not my place to push my emotions onto him
i have been living in a state of pretty strong loneliness for about three years maybe a bit more without really recognizing it i have been held over by some good extracurriculars and a few select great people in my life but wow they all went abroad this semester my thesis is murdering me and just i am on an exceptionally isolated campus and just have fallen apart this semester
hey guys i have been talking to this guy for almost a year now we were dating on and off and in the beginning it was really nice then the more i started spending time with him the more i found out he was still in love with his ex
and i do not like that because it feels forced and awkward maybe even one last kiss idk i am mostly just venting here but also looking for some advice
alrighty so everyone knows that at times reddit can be a bit of a stressful and troublesome site with constant attacks based upon improper grammar or minor things but despite everything there are alot of positives to it like this subreddit helping people sort through their mental health and issues and the likes anyways this is how reddit has helped me as a person and i hope that everyone could share their positive reddit stories
but ever since i graduated no one has reached out to me and we even had a huge argument all because they felt as if i was betraying them by going to an international school instead of a local school where they all went
i feel both lonely but at the same time i can not tell if it is that or if i am worried which is something else i have been doing lately worrying for no reason
but i am just a soul whose intentions are goodbecause idk i just miss talking to someone that seems to genuinely understand what i am saying without judgment
i fought it up until 2019 early 2020 it is getting worse i wake every morning having to vomit due to anxiety
it is literally not even a problem if she does not have the money just do not be so rudehi i know the title really hurts but things are kind of out of control in my life
i am such a romantic i am obsessed with love really i love reading and watching romance like i love breathing
and after being together for only 2 months she called me at work to tell me she was pregnant but that is where te problems started
about 34 months ago i took acid the experience was very foreign but welcoming it surely was and she did not want to get into a formal relationship before there were certain guarantees
breathwork is a type of meditation that involves consciously changing your breathing patterns certain breathing patterns can actually produce real physiological changes in your body and mind but how does just breathing do this there is actually a couple ways
for a 58 height but ended fine i still care about him deeply and can not even be mad at him i am just so so sad
i have been selfharm free for about a week and now i am looking at my scars and see that my skin is so dark
i tried moving on including going to school changing jobs to something i thought was meaningful moved to a new state and tried new relationships but no matter what i feel unsatisfied and lonely
you said love died in front of your eyes two years ago and with me you found out love is still there
ever have really dark cloudy days times when every second seems like 5 and your thoughts are running at twice normal speed i am so sick of feeling hopeless and worthless i am the only provider for my family and i often feel used and abused like i am just a meal ticket to them
i would hit things my knuckles are scar tissue to this dayi have never been one to have a large number of friends just 34 really good ones
trying to drive him away from me and being upset overall is not working he keeps saying nothings wrong why are you sad and just being frustrated want to kms after new years maybe the drugs can make me more brave
i feel like a robot just floating around while doing and saying stupid stuff because i have no soul inside of me
that is my instagram account since i am not that active here francoismedhat all i want is a friend idk what it is about me
so my ex who dumped me in june kept calling and texting me in november but i ignored her so i decided to text her back and now i fell like a dumbass and want to kill my self
and i am not even allowed to complain or else i am weird i just come on here to vent and i am not even allowed that
i am going to tell this fast paced towards the end i will go in detailed i worked at chipotle and i met this girl and i fell in love with her and we talked and talked and eventually i had the guts to tell her i have a crush on her she seemed kind of happy and the next day she said the same thing
on christmas a week after he came back i decided to spend christmas with him instead of my family since he is on quarantine and he might get lonely
there is recently been alot of buzz surrounding companies providing psychedelic therapy i was wondering what were your thoughts on the issue
sometimes i feel like i have felt everything i have needed to feel when it comes to love my mom would be better off with out me i would be better off dead
when confronted she explained to me that she needs to focus on herself to be happy with herself before she can make someone else happy like me
but no i was naive i do not know how could i think about such a thing i never had a relationship before
hope everyone is hanging in there bummer i can not have some of my fellow depresso redditors here to hang with and drink i have got lots of apple pie left from my solo christmas dinner ice cream too i would be happy to share
does any one of you hope that one day you will not be feeling so lonely stop being so isolated having someone very close
there is no more emotion left just pain and anger and sometimes sadness i went from being a man who could crush something with a 90 failrate computer science to finding getting out of bed to be an exceptionally trying task
i am fine with psychodelics but not ketamine which is a rape drug and she has been sexually assaulted twice which made me extremely overprotective
i can not do anything but if i am idle intrusive thoughts about my sexuality start screaming at me sometimes i can not even relate to my own relatives
since day one we both knew we were soulmates got engaged on day three and it has stayed like this up to this point for 9 months we still love each other just the same as on day one even when we moved in together after 5 months and due to covid have spent 247 together
but that is not my main issue cuz i know i can fix it my problem is my mind i wish i did not want that
i feel stuck in this loop of restlessness i want to do something but i can not yet i also do not want to do nothing
loving him was the easiest thing i have ever done but now i am supposed to act like we never happened i am supposed to pretend like i never loved him like i never made all those memories with him
she is going on a two week holiday and it has not even been 24 hours since i last saw her but now that she is not here i just feel completely alone
just i do not know how to tell my mom that it is not working i can not keep lying to her that it is helping me but i can not not lie to her because i have been lying since session two
there are things that go in my head that i do not want my parents to know about cuz i know that it will break them
during lockdown i emailed a singer and just did it right then and there some pics hurt more than others but i did it
with the guy that i used to talk to i mean there are a lot of bad memories i have with my family that i wish i had done differently
i know everybody has their own things to worry about but i know damn well when their birthdays come around they have celebrations because they post all about it
i am not really sure i want to stay around anymore i have been thinking about taking my own life more and more frequently especially this year
i get overly mad when people talk about my country and oversensitive about politics i am up at 510 am on christmas day typing this out while listening to russian doomer music
i find it difficult to describe myself in definitive and positive terms like kind smart tall hardworking because i truly believe that am none of those things it even feels presumptuous of me to find ways to praise myself because it feels untruthful and arrogant
being left on read means they have seen what you have said and chosen to ignore it funny thing is i am only a freshman in high school i need advice or just someone to talk to
i have nothing wrong happening in my life in fact from an outsiders perspective it might look good somehow idk tbh
we have mutual couple friends and i have been told he is not acting like himself drinking smoking a ton i have seen pics of them together and he seems genuinely happy
distractions do not work no matter how hard i try people say to find new hobbies we only talk for the time we are there
i used to do this when i was younger but they were dating apps i used them strictly to talk to people now as an adult i think i want to use them again but ones made for looking for friends or for people who have things in common with me i put off setting up an account because i need a profile pic hate selfies lol
there were some small issues but ultimately i really liked him cared about him and felt that we had something good
17 years of age just last night had a good friend of mine female sleep in my queensized bed with me was nothing more than sleep and chatting
now i feel like i am able to feel more at ease with this slowed down pace yes it is slightly boring and not many things are happening especially that we live in an era where we are constantly given this mentality of being fed and stimulated all the time or demand to be stimulated all the time but i felt that my life was more managable that way
groinal response makes me not being able to be with my littlebrother how do i recoverjust let me go and have and endless dream please it is for the best
i like him i really really like him but i am not in a good place where i can be the partner for him that he needs
after this really weird and awkward exchange the conversation slowly goes back to normal i drive them both home tim is on the way first then me and bob share our thought and have this weird feeling about some bullsht has being told i am no doctor but sounds really weird being terminally ill from a mental deseas like it may lead you to something but is not like cancer or some medical condition
almost like if i pull the plug and ditch what i consider an overly manly career i might as well just look forward to being a 37 year old bum
i could not get rid of my bad habits i could not even get into the college i wanted to study in even after working so hard
i am here again and i am lost for a reason to continue going on i can not get my self to do the things i want to do rather i have to force myself into a situation with dire consequences to get my self to do the normal things in life
something that came as a shock to me quite recently is that i actually fell in love with your social persona how you are with your friends
i just got an apartment recently i live in a small town so there is not much to do or people to hangout with
daily i ask myself how much more isolating i can take i do not think i would be missed if i was not here as nobody has missed me since march really even before march i am just not on anyone s mind to be missed
i do not call him or talk to him on the phone i do not tell him i miss him or talk about our relationship and i do not talk to him when i am upset
i 27f got into an okc relationship after 3 years of giving up on dating i was 213lbs and just boredseeing what was out there
you choose not to ask you choose to mark the distance you bring some things up and i apologise you where distant it is ok
they are aware about my friend but do not understand i am scared i am heading back down the rabbit hole after beating 3 years of struggle
there are days where i just sit and cry and i do not know what to do life feels to hard sometimes
for quite some time i was doing really well not needing anyone and i am sure it must be possible not to need anyone
i can not even have a conversation with anyone because i get too dysphoric if i know someone views me as a man so everyone my brain starts to shut down and i cry get sleepy or i can not focus
i deleted most of my social medias after finding out about this and to be quite honest i am feeling a little better
she invited me to spend xmas morning with her and my girls and himtoday i have watched soul from pixardisney i know it was not much it is an animation usually intended for children
i am an 18 year old girl and i have hated my body for over a decade i remember hearing my mom make comments about her postbaby tummy as she changed clothes her spider veins every i need to lose weight i started sucking in my stomach at a very young age and crying while looking in the mirror because i thought i was ugly
i started noticing it a year ago when i kind of tracked how my moods are going and realized that every day was blanddull with no mood at all more sad ish tho and then i either get super happy and enthusiastic get a big energy boost and motivation doing stuff i needwant or i get super sad when i can not do basically anything
i found out that 3 years of being together she was having an emotional affair supposedly that is all she claims it was for about 1 year out of the 3 we were together
i have trouble eating because i feel like people are poisoning my food or putting something in it then i took her home and went to sleep again
as time went on i got bigger and felt my child within me and finally gave birth i woke in absolute shock and cried for at least a few hours
i am alone and in this pandemic i have a few friends but we can not hangout i just want to stop feeling so much pain i miss them so much i want them back
but i feel like if i do say everything i want to everyone including the bad stuff they will feel like extra bad that they were a reason to why i died
social phobia in which a person experiences overwhelming anxietyhttpswwwwebmdcombalancestressmanagementrmquizstressanxiety and selfconsciousness in common social situations dependent personality disorderhttpswwwwebmdcomanxietypanicguidedependentpersonalitydisorder in which people rely excessively on others for advice or to make decisions for them
then he flew to his family for a month i really love you a i hate that we got to move different paths
i have been suicidal since i was a teenager i have attempted it 2 times but chickened out at the last moment it is been a full year since i last though of killing myself but recently it is coming back to my head maybe it is the season or something but this last couple of days i have been thinking and thinking about it nonstop
i am so paranoid of people online that i can not click a youtube link without thinking it is malicious i hope someone can help me out
sex was an indication of my love to him am i not doing something that takes it awayit has been almost two years since we broke up
when we were dating she started acting a bit differently and no matter how much i asked her she did not tell me why
spent a year working in vfx but then suddenly all of my coworkers only 2 more guys had to go one for family reasons the other because her two parents died so yeah
i am trying to get better at writing and i also love this idea what do you think is it bs or am i on to something in your eyes
i know the title is phrased weird but basically i have a question for anyone who is suffered with this problem i have been an extremely fortunate person throughout my life and most of my problems are mental health based
she said no be with him he needs you now after i dropped her home she texted me right away that she is not happy with my decision
hello everyone i do not really know what to write besides that i feel very alone it is christmas and everyone seems to be so happy but every day i feel more alone
you are the most selfish and disrespectful person i have ever known and i am pissed i am just seeing that now how experiencing the real thing can be so different like love
i want to have a normal life i am a 30 years old woman and at this age i should be married and have a family
i have an issue that is been persistent through my life where in i have always cried out for attention and kind of attacked others to get said attention
also essential info i started smoking weed regularly ever since the breakup which has led to daily smoking for most of the pandemic today was my first full day without smoking in like 2 months
i 32 f have a close friend 35 m who suffers from depression and anxiety we live in different countries now but have stayed close texting and talking on the phone almost every day it has happened before that he went silent for a few days because of his depressionanxiety acting up but so far he has always resurfaced rather quickly
its driving me insane and i genuinely do not know if i can overlook this for a much longer time because it really does add to my mental health struggle
you will know when your completely over them when you do not care about what they or their friends are doing that you do not look for their family friends or their car while your driving
that is true and we do love each other a lot but you need more than just love for a relationship to be healthy
because there is light at the end of the tunnel you may be far from it or you may be close but you will never know until you reach it
i have spoken to a few guys here and there recently and i can not seem to create an emotional connection with anyone no matter how hard i try
for example my ocd is telling me to rearrange the books i do not want to rearrange them but i can not ignore my ocd
for me it only seemed fair that i too move out of my city as she would be doing the same as the indian custom is where its the woman who leaves her house to live with the man
i swear i can not take this anymorei do not need replies like there are a lot of girls we dated for 8 months but were best friends beforehand and our connection was really special
but at least i am finally feel free so much horrid shit went down and he manipulated me to hell and back good riddance
he later texted me saying he was on and off and trying to see how social media played a role in his life
she said my blowing up her phone was why she kept going back to him the stress made her go back to him as it was like an addiction
the human condition is all we are made of my family runs deeper than the ocean this guys stays at almost 12 am waiting to hang out with her to catch things up
i am 16 btw my mean ass mother would probably be happier without me and so would the world be goodbye reddit some communities were toxic towards me but that is okay now
that there was no need to be jealous there was nothing to be jealous of i choose to ignore any of those thoughts and accept that that is in the past
i think mostly i just regret developing a lot of friendships because they make me uncomfortable and nervous even though i have no reason to be
i have continued with therapy and learned a lot of very helpful cbt techniques and recently decided i just do not want or need to be on the medication anymore
i needed that class to graduate and now i am paranoid and feel so stupid i feel like all my professors are watching me
sometimes my school was like a prison for me only imagine this school i needed to take train from my city to another then i take a bus to village that near this city and after near this village is one more village with our school every two weeks i can go home to family for 15 days
i hate this time of year i have always had mental health issues been hospitalized twice as a teenager self harmed drank mouthwash just to get drunk to ignore my feelings whatever i had a great life growing up nothing really triggered me to become this way i guess my brain is very chemically imbalanced
hello i am 22 f and partner is 21 m i blame it on social anxiety disorder but maybe i am just an uninteresting twat
i tried to talk about it to solve it she said she is busy what seems unrealistic to me and more like not giving a fuck about me
now that you know a bit of my background i will get to the question honestly i am not nearly as sad as i thought i would be
i want to say myself one day agata you are enoughcompulsive eater and food addict gained 70lbs this year up to 510 210 pounds
my abuser is still in my life and you helped me grow as a person and as a lover and a boyfriend
initially i forgave him and told him do not talk about my business without me knowing i was willing to do the work
i hope tomorrow i can finish up a few things sense of calm knowing it will finally be over hope it will go alright i am tired
i want to die so badly that i do not see a future where i am not 6 feet under i just sleep now and do not even do anything
as a side note i have never felt this fucking deflated and incredibly depressedand on christmas day for christs sake so i would seriously appreciate any help and i really hope that your christmas was a bit merrier than mine
i thought i was starting to feel better but i feel like i have sunken back for some reason he has been on my mind constantly the past 2 days i feel so many emotions from intense anger to deep depressive lows and it is so hard to keep up with
though the gaps in my youth may yield different results half the time i do not know what day it is and if it was not for work i would never know the current day of the week or the date
my ex broke up with me a week ago and said hurtful things about me and basically blamed me for everything that went wrong in the relationship behind my back
at the beginning of the pandemic i had a solid network of friends and family and we were all supportive of each other
he thinks the little effort he puts in is him doing me a favor he is very resentful towards me i enjoy writing greeting cards and he had them all around his kitchen now they are all down
the constant crying when the kids are asleep i am so lost and broken and do not know where to start i just do not know what to do or how to feel anymore
my brother poked fun at me because he was lucky and did not really know why i was so upset and i just took it rather than jabbing back
7 milion per day for 3 monthes i just want a way to either leave or die seeing as there is no way out
to still care while i am ill and still get disrespected when i am pushing out my pains to help you i was always there for you through thick and thin
through this a concerned cousin on my dads side checks in i mention to get that om not working right now
for years i have tried to convince myself that i am not that bad that i have a reason to continue living but lately i came to realistation that i have fucked my life so much that there really is not a point of trying i am basicly useless lost all my friends failling my studies my parents resent me for it they really do not even care about how i feel so there is not really a point is it
requests an appointment to discuss a new symptom i stayed as she was incredible the most beautiful woman i had ever seen and just an idiot
were thinking about having kids but the thought of post partum on top of this scares me so much that recently i can not stop the intrusive thought of well at least you could kill yourself
while he never defined the relationship we were still actively sexed and continuing the relationship roles so this was massive breach of trust
i do not understand why i have to feel this much pain every single day i feel like i am going to vomit
i complain i get sad around them i get annoyed i get mad but all of these are just surface feelings
when i confronted about this he just took it as a personal attack and said that he was doing his best to make time for me
i just wanted a yes or a no these were the types of interactions we always had when it came to conversation
i am just scared that sending that message might come across as me trying to manipulate him or that he might call emergency services
i do not know what kind of answer i expect but maybe some advice i am not on the autism spectrum and do not have any development disorder i do suffer from serveral mental health issues but i am doing okay i did not have any outbreaks or anything lately thank you in advance
i notice this happening a lot especially when it is been a while since i have consciously exercised that faculty and when i am a bit sleep deprived like right now
every time i try to get a shower i find that my mind goes to a very dark place most likely due to a lack of outside stimulation and because of this i have not been able to shower because the thought of doing so scares me
and my best friend always calls me up on important dates and invites me around whenever we can i am being held by sting but its string none the less
you told me how depressed you are and are now turning to god to help you find yourself i hope that can help
and you will be okay with that bc you will either be happy by yourself or with someone else but it is not worth waiting for someone who will not come around
i feel so ugly and i wish i looked like all those pretty european girls looked like i just moved to the uk from the us and the girls are so much skinnier and i hate the fact that i am only half white being mixed makes me feel ugly in comparison to those white girls because i feel i will never live up to those beauty preferences most of these european guys seem to have
ok my apologies if this is the wrong place to post this but i would guess maybe there is some psychological knowledge here
how experiencing the real thing can be so different like loveif you are lonely during the upcoming holidays go ahead and reach out to me
this goes not only for streaming but for lifei just can not anymore i tried to choke myself with my belt and it did not work
i am so sick of being sad but the truth is you do not find the same person twice between the pandemic the distance and these challenges it is difficult to fight against it all
she has no friends because she does not put in effort and keeps no contact with people always expects people to be the ones to reach out to her
every one works through stuff and opens up on there own time line and i was going to slow for her so she just called it quits
and no there is no friends i can talked to everyone have their lives set and working because of time difference it is hard to reach them too
the sheer amount of energy i need to push it down and function in daily life not all that different for me have built up a pathetic collection of rilakkuma bears
she was upfront and told me about both times straight away and swore nothing happened just typing this i have trouble focusing and putting all of my thoughts into it correctly
on top of this i can not see a psychiatrist or therapist because of my parents i am 17 if i say i need to see someone they either shrug it off or they say they will do something but end up doing absolutely nothing
killing myself is inevitable it is just a matter of time all i wanted was to feel heard felt understood appreciated acknowledged in the least turned out i was asking for too much
now the opposite way occurs by the superego thinking about drugs but the id does not want to do it the id does it and feels bad about it but the superego gives it rationality saying things like it makes us better in the case the id does not do it the superego floods the id with these thoughts until the id yields sooner or later
so a couple of days ago i found out my ex girlfriend got engaged people experience things differently but do not give up just yet
they also make jokes about me being depressed and suicidal i am so sick and done with it they clearly do not care if i am gone
i have even toyed with the idea of leaving my wife so i will not have to deal with it but i can not because i love and care for her
and idk i have seen people die and i actually feel like i am going to be dead soon which tempts me to take more that overdose i had 7 days ago poisoned my blood and also caused me to go into shock which i somehow survived on my own asbi i said in the last post and yeah
i was very angry and deep in my obsession and argument in my mind when i some how just discovered that i was enjoying this negative thought even though i was annoyed
so try to realize that also know that each advance you make to pursue contact with your ex is just pushing them more and more away from you hell they could even be laughing at your desperation right now
i want to be erased from existence but i have to wake up tomorrow morning and the morning after that and go through another fucking day and i can not
it is like somehow these people were the chosen one i have never ever ever been on a date xrays on my left leg which was unbearably painful find it is a fracture of the femur
i stayed because we were a family but i found myself doing things that were not normal for relationships to thrive in
but you know that the only reason i did that is because we never really talked about anything 10 years old is when all my intrusive thoughts started
i have been hanging out with friends more and laughing more than i had in months oh yeah and making a little more money than before
but too often i ended up getting reminded of how things used to be and of how much i miss her and try to forget about that
it is not even like a nagging resentment it is a pain in my chest and anger in my fists kind of feeling anytime anything ever comes up
i should not have been so attached maybe i deserve to feel this way this is what i get for being so naive and stupid
if anyone can help or knows where to direct me so i can receive help it would be greatly appreciated because this is something i cannot stop thinking about
i see him once a month precovid in person currently on a zoom call as he is another volunteer at the organization we are both involved in
i randomly got a message from this kid from my high school 4 years ago asking if i remember him obviously i do so i said yes the conversation went like this
say i am mad tell yourself why your madwhy do i remain in a toxic situation or continue to hurt myself after a breakup
i feel like a normal person trapped in the mind of this autistic prick her friend took my side in all of this truthfully do i feel bad about that
we both talked and suddenly for some reason she also begged not to talk to me but was touching him like he really loves her
and even though most likely nobodys going to read even the first sentence of whatever the fuck this is i still got to leave a thank you here if you did do that
what the fck am i supposed to do just be ready mom just be ready if i take my own life one day because i am already so tired of it
when i asked if we can continue the conversation the next day because she was busy painting her nails and was not really paying attention to me facetime and that was making me feel worse she said no we will not talk about it and then hung up
just been feeling horrible ever since and this damn holiday is just making it worse i think about it constantly it feels sickening
after 45 minutes i texted her she is like heyyy i said call she said no i was busy with mom and now am going to charge my phone and later i have a tuition class i got a little upset and said okay after her classi knew the timings i texted her and asked if she is free i wanted to talk to her about my day she said she is watching netflix i said okay and then i asked so tell me how is everything she was giving me late replies and even lame replies i asked her if she even wanted to talk she said i am talking
while you would definitely be excited in the short term it would only be a matter of time before your expectations change to fit your new budget
i always give value to people who do not even give a fuck about me i am always the one chatting them up and asking them how they are doing they do not talk to me unless i initiate it or unless they need something like help with schoolwork when i open up to these friends who have ignored me for so long they change the topic and bring it back to themselves and their own problems
there was no point in keeping itsince it was literally almost always me initiating chats and when i stopped doing it this timei have not heard from them since a month now
which made me want to be better than him and in that process i realized that he was being brainwashed about my family being inferior to his
we are not lonely because we are depressed we are depressed because we are lonelybetrayedheartbroken or whatever adjetives suits you better humans are emotional beings
plan is to go home and work on myself because the truth is i relied on her for my happiness i know i need to be selffulfilled when it comes to that i have not been for a quite a while i just feel like such a pos at the moment though
eventually we started talking about nudity and how we always pushed the limits with our groups the males sometimes stripped completely naked in random crazy situations while a couple of girls uncovered their breasts at best but covered with their arms
i hope that they are having a good christmas i hope it is a wonderful intro to the next yearto all this christmas you are not alone you are loved and amazing stay strong
the laboratory for the study of anxiety disorders at the university of texas at austin is conducting a nocost intervention study examining how mindfulness may reduce feelings of loneliness
edit after realizing the consequences and other things i have stopped thinking about suicide it is not worth it i miss you so much it hurts but i do not ever think you will miss me in the same way
i tried medication no luck i tried meditation no luckstruggling with selfmaintenance hygiene etc and feeling extreme shame over ithard time completing basic tasks like cleaning cooking etc
its so weird looking at photos of my ex she is so beautiful but she seems so distant now like someone i have never met before
i am broken because i did my best and it did not work it was just a couple of months before we tried to meet and she just decided to leave not because of me or because she was doing the best for me she just leave because she did not feel comfortable with me anymore
i promised 2 of my best friends i would never od again but here i am fighting the urge to do it
still i did not realize how bad it was and when my mom was not pulling out knives and my dad was not beating up my brother it was okay
this friend loves to cook and clean and just help people in general so he would always go food shopping or run errands for my parents he is socially awkward and loved having my parents around
the fear of being watched by everyone in the classroom while standing up and asking questions was always there so i did not ask any questions
i tried to make it work for those few months she was still seeing that guy i know i am an idiot for trying to make it work but eventually she just left me in the apartment and broke it off with me about 6 months ago to be with him
do you want to die or do you just want a reason to live its been two weeks and it gets worse i am constantly crying
when life hits you hard you have got to look forward because no matter what age you are you always have a future to look to
i can not say i feel good about the actual food but it was so nice to actually engage with my family and my little brother was really excited for me to sit with him at the table again
i am just constantly plagued by anxiety and intrusive thoughts that do not make sense i am not sure if i am simply an anxious person or if i have ocd or some other condition
with all that context there is not an aspect of my life that is driving the decision to want to end my life that needs to be retooled or recalibrated
i am a whiny annoying manipulative piece of shit so it is not like anyone will care about me this was all over the place but i am too lazy to continue writing
my dad said that he feels like dying a lot and he sometimes even thinks when he is driving what if i just drove off the road
she was all the time there supporting me and giving me some hope about a change that i did not make because i so stupid and coward
alone in my room and patiently waiting for this night to end i sit here in quiet contemplation feeling that missing something waft about my bedroom like a cold breeze but what it is that i am missing escapes me and so here i am to just send out this digital message in a bottle out to sea and see what these reddit waves could catch
he wants to fix our fathers mess and after that he probably wants to commit suicide i want to kill myself
she has her life sorted out at 23 and is living it to the fullest ill be moving back home with no real goal and starting again at 26
she literally said she does not really even like my face and she just wants to punch it3 like me just think suicidal thoughts maybe even do one of them
given everything that is happening in the world i thought i would share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources please feel free to add others you find particularly useful
so i have a history of depression anxiety and episodes of severe paranoia during one of these episodes i had convinced myself that my friends were plotting against me
i live just outside of chicago so i was planning on jumping off a building as soon as possible but 1 i do not know how to get to the top of one and 2 i do not want to like jump off in front of people and scar their lives forever so are there like back alley places that exist because i really just i need to fucking kill myself lmaoooo
i recently found out i am gay which could result in my death where i am from i was a department manager and i get to go and be a stocker
thises what i am fealing right now every one feels far away while i am locked away every one talks so easyl to each other and i can not help but feel jelous how does it come so naturel these people make frinds quickly am i doomed to no real friends
why honestly why was i such a dick to my motheri have never had a job and will likely never find one with the pandemic
i deserve someone who makes me feel like a goddess and wants me to know every hour of the day that i am loved
me and my gf broke up an year ago in november we spent two years togetherbut it is getting ever more tempting
this got to me but i did not think anything of it really i told myself i was getting too much in my own head i messaged them the day before to remind them
i have had my childhood stolen away by mental health issues and development issues the only reason i have not killed myself is because i do not want to upset my gf or my family but i should not have to live to not make others sad why can not i just be aloud to die
i did not think this person would do this since over the past month we talked gamed online and watched anime and suddenly this happened for no reason even though last night i stood up until late with her because she was drunk as hell now she just ghosted me
right after we breakup she added all the guys she was talking to and started dating and with corona and everything i really just want to wear a mask there
have just resigned myself to i am a solitary soul but deep down i know i am lonely i ruin it every night
my question is whether there would be likely adverse consequences to this namely in the employment realm right now i work for myself but that could always change
after being clean for almost 3 years i relapsed back into selfharm while 4 months is not a lot it is been a really hard four months i have thought about selfharm a lot in these four months and it is been hard to resist i am hoping that making this post about this small milestone will help and things will start looking up
christmas is not fun for everyone i feel sick being stuck around happy people all holiday season long while i am depressed it feels like a reminder of my misery i do not see what is so great about christmas anyway
this is basically my eulogy it is the story of all my mental problems and struggles for the last 10 years till now which is finally coming to a conclusion
christmas morning my car is not starting i am broke i am alone i am trying to keep positive but i am starting to feel numb and now crying typing this why am i pathetic
but then i was stupid and made it more then cuddling and we end up having sex then i just got dressed and went home
i am scared waiting to see where i will break and what will happen because i do not see how i can keep going like this
we met the next day i stayed the night and never really ended up leaving it is been 8 months since then and we have had really high highs and extremely low lows
my ex gf was watching but i did not think it was a big deal because we are all very intimate with eachother in that group sometimes when we are drunks there are hippie like situations
love hurtsso basically i met a girl on hinge and we clicked almost immediately i do not want to be making excuses but i have to i genuinely do not want to see them
my ex and i had a mutual breakup due to ld i took it much harder than she did and she asked for no contact i broke nc a number of times
i have been with her for three months meanwile losing my virginity due to an impulse and i regret it ever since as it devoured me from the inside because of how guilty and irresponsible i felt
i felt like i could talk about anything with that person and i was very safe tbh i feel like she is just trying to avoid seeing me
i have been trying my best to heal and everything from the situation in the way i find the most healthy staying distracted with friends working a lot and when i am alone reflecting on everything and trying to find peace within myself
he lives with my grandmother and practically relies on her to care for us while we are with him there is more to that which i choose not to discuss
more like be with someone having a good time in company the sex part was not really as important and later i had proof of it
that is it every talk about feelings impossible i felt the trembles coming so i asked my mom if i could sleep in bed with her
initially i accepted that i needed to move on for a brief time i even felt fine with it then came the anger and resentment for them
with all that being said i have told myself for years now that i would not live past 18 that there was no life for me past being 18
the few rare times when i am brave enough to stand up to your bullshit you pull the victim card give a cold shoulder and sob
he made my life hell he set me up for failure i could never do anything rightnow we come to the complete disaster part
i went to a youth homeless shelter and stayed for 6 months it was full of drama and stress that made me constantly sick
i think that when i was in elementary i had developed this mentality that if if people did not talk to me then did not make sense for me to talk to them
our relationship had issues and i think it is meant to be this way but fuck i miss her she could not stand my family which made things difficult and she has a lot of mental struggles that played into our breakup i am just having a hard time letting to is there something i can do to help myself let go
at this point i just cried and told her how much i love her that i can still find ways to adjust and make ends meet
despite this we became stronger during the first months of the long distance relationship we would call everyday message each other good mornings treat each other to food and sent each other gifts
in a relationship i want a girl that is broken like me i might have my problems but i feel like i could be a great boyfriend if i tried i would be there for her because i know what it is like and she would be there for me because she knows what it is like but it looks like that will not happen in a while if it even does
in the most useful empirical model we havehttpswwwapaorgscienceaboutpsa200906scibrief the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world
any advicei am at a point where i am not sure if i care anymore like about anything it is always when they get drunk which is getting more often
i have to sleep with plushies in order to cope i watch cartoons in order to regress my mind to a state of being where i do not have to worry about interpersonal relationships
crying my eyes out i felt like we were just meant to be that it would work out i just needed wait for you you never wanted to me i am heartbroken i loved you i loved you more then you know i never told you i am glad i did not i just still loved you god how i wished you felt the same
i at least hope he misses me at all even a little we spent a whole year together he is been consuming my thoughts it feels unfair for me to just leave his mind
its clear and really thick but i see them the people yelling they tell me to break through and that they love me
so it feels like the only solution i can not forgive myself the thought alone makes me feel extremely selfish and toxic
my default state is stable not good not bad just nothing stability and it is hard now to justify why i should press on especially since with my engineering skills i am sure i can devise as least painful a way as possible for my family to end myself
i am too fundamentally broken no one will ever want methe police turned up at my door last night and my ex tried to get me into trouble
it is always been difficult for me to be open especially since i am in therapy for social anxiety i just needed somebody to know and possibly give me encouragement since the session is still days away
i held off on telling people to protect you and myself to be able to leave the door open and because i did not want to share the news and my grief and i do not think it would have been good for me to do that at the time
i feel like this relationship has taught me so much he taught me how to find love within myself again and he has taught me that i am lovable
i do not know what is going on but i got to do something going so long without talking to somebody scares the heck out of me
i am referred as the gay bestfriend excuse me what why would i wear panties wear feminine clothing just to be a fucking boy
but i have gastrointestinal issues causing constipation and i can not get to a bathroom often i was not raised like this and i do not qualify for homeless services
i told him i missed him it just slipped out because i really do love him and i really do miss him
i had gotten off of the phone with a helpline just to see if it changes the mood i am in but the woman at the other end did not seem interested for a few reasons
my wife and i have not seen family in over a year now we have taken every precaution and more including not eating out and distancing ourselves at all times
i will probably write one last post before i go because this sub has helped me feel so understood when no one else did and it is helped me a lot over the years
i feel stupid but also kind of laugh at myself for attempting it i never attempted suicide before so i guess i feel kind of
the reason why i am so jaded is because back in oh 2013 i lost my mind after losing several friends a cousin and nearly my mother also working 7080 hours per week i snapped
my ex and i have been broken up for quite a while now so why does it still hurt i am honestly embarrassed that i am still not over it so pleaseee if anyone knows any tips to get over an ex for good help me out
however things looked up when i met this girl who was going through the similar situation i am having we were able to hold on everyday because of our support for each other
does anyone else experience this or have any knowledge of mental health that could contribute to this all comments are appreciated
i not an empty she will but instead feel happy i not in my mind picturing the false reality i wish i wanted
and so am i alone in a saturday night i would just want someone to talk to but i feel like i i have lost everything i had this year
anyway back to my original point the break up was really civil almost friendly haha i even lost contact to my best friend for several months
was basically asking if i broke up with her to be with other girls and stuff but it killed me seeing her that upset because she is such a good person i explained and explained it is not her fault and it is mine that i can not help thinking like that and having doubts i wish we could have went on and i never had doubts but i did have them
8 find a way to volunteer with others online helping others is a massive mood booster and can also be a great way to find new connections
we all have different things inside of us different likes dislikes attributes characteristics insecurities struggles strengths things that make us happy etc
death itself has never scared me but the horror of somehow failing the deed and being sent into an even worse situation is terrifying to me
is it only to seek attention from other people or is it anything else that is none of the above
even if l know it was my fault and l might have lost the love of my life it broke me down to see his profiles
a bigger and better door will open up for you soon enough and you will laugh so hard at all of the stupid crap that everybody put you through and smile at yourself because you know that you are worthy of self love and are valuable
but i still can not help but feel like i am walking into this new decade of life just as lonely as i was when i first started feeling loneliness 3 years ago
here is a bulletpoint list of what went down at my house last night my mother had been drinking in fact she recently started drinking again after taking a fourweek break
donate to the food bank as i said earlier cook for friends to save them from having to buy the groceries cooking them doing the dishes etc
i called the suicide hotline but they told me that they could not do anything if they did not know the persons location
to this day it still has not been brought up anytime i try to talk to her about anything i get dismissed like i am a bother
he promised he would never leave me he promised me we would be together foreveri am at breaking point i do not know what to do
you guessed it we grew apart they made new friends but they still hang out with each other but they leave me out
hey guys i just published my video on youtube i talked about dignity vs validation i would love for you guys to check it out and tell me how i did
it seems like he wants to leave me for good now i know she is not a cheater i love this girl with all my heart
main point is that i feel alone in a crowd that i am supposed be familiar with i feel that being alone is the better option as compared to continuing to mingle with these people that keep putting me down for the benefit of pulling themselves up but i still feel the negative effect of being alone how do you all deal with it
he would talk to her all day and that got to me a little because we were long distance at the moment and i could only spend a couple hours a day with him at max and that was only at alot of sacrifices on my end
i mean i do not trust you guys either but it is worth a shot i am so paranoid of people online that i can not click a youtube link without thinking it is malicious
i just hope there is still time before my brain fully finishes developing so that i can modify it and i am scared all of my behaviors are already neurologically etched and all i can do from now on is just use coping mechanisms
i miss having parents i just got out of childhod and i already miss being a kid my soul is hurting inside of this fucking body
he and lisa broke up and he begged me to stay in his life i said no but he kept begging me he told me to go to therapy and that he wanted to try again with me
i was depressed for a very long time and it was not healthy yes it was a very shitty time of my life but i rather be depressed than in denial
i will add payment information once there are enough people willing to donate as i do not want to basically get someone donating money and then not get the rest and then i just have someone is money for no reason
however i always felt like i had to take care of her and in the long term this would not have worked as i knew she was not the kind of person i could see myself with accomplishing my goals
i think that when you have nothing to do even the things you love just do not have that same spark anymore everything feels dull and boring and i do not know what to do with my life my dad is often talking about me getting a career but really nothing feels interesting so i do not know what to or where to start
i do not deserve to be happy because i am a piece of shit and pieces of shit do not get anything out of life
i did not deserve anything at all for christmas i was a burden to my parents i was fat and lazy and i was poor of character
i am tired of living i am just tied i am tired i am tired i am going to end my pain this was me my last christmas eve i am here on earth because at 12 am eastern time i will end my life i am happy for this decision the pain will go away it 818 pm right now i am listening to my sad mexican music enjoying my last couple hours
i am not sure if this post belongs here but i just wanted to share that sometimes when the loneliness gets too much to bear and it start to hurt causing breathlessness i like listen to adventure times song everything stays it really helps to ease the pain
i somehow made my way to the hidden photos tab on my google photos and started looking at the old photos of my exgirlfriend and me for two minutes
so my girlfriend has been distant lately to the extent i have not spoken to her in a while well i send stuff like hey and say good night and stuff but i am always left on read i know i am not the best boyfriend in the way i do not care what she does i am not protective but i do not want to push her away since i love her
she had always been insecure about dating we casually and jokingly called it the vibes she was always getting propositioned like a lot a lot
they might come back when i am in bed and wondering how much longer until i find someone i can look in the eyes and be vulnerable in front of
i do not know how to turn it off i do not know how to stop believing he can and will wake up to himself one day
that thinking about all of our good memories hurts her and that her secret man may have all this money attractive qualities vehicles and showers her with validation and compliments that make her want to fuck him but everything else i did stopped being fulfilled
now when it comes to fixing yourself even with that mindset it is very much like well i am broken so i need to fix something
i have suffered from pretty bad anxiety for as long as i can remember with no obvious triggers or causes and have perfectionist tendencies which i was in denial about for a long time
like someone she needed to hang out with before getting back with her exwe met back in january while i was in a relationship i was not happy in
every bone in my body is urging me to quit my weekend job to free up more time for my course but i am reluctant to do so because i am frightened of becoming even more lonely than i already am
though i can see more clearly than ever how she treated me it does not take away how happy i was with her in the beginning
she was almost inconcsious she told me she took a couple of sleeping pills and vodka and that she is falling asleep
it feels like life is a car on a mountain road headed toward a cliff but it is too late to steer away or break there is only one possible ending and all you can do is watch in slow motion as you go over the edge
i reach my arms out to touch it but it disappearsit is important to know that this is normal noone can meditate without having thoughts
i do not know where to start i am 13 years old and i am already planning to go on a mass murder at my school and commit suicide afterwards i truly do not know what i am doing i have not seen a psychologist and will not so i am not diagnosed with depression or being a psychopath actually
it is still a nice release though i just went back on my medication i just do not know what alternative there is
my life has in no way improved other than getting rid of the toxic individuals in my life but i have come to accept it and put less pressure and stress on myself
argos mental health movie playlist is a brilliant goto during mundane nights in alone especially during quarantine here is the link to download argo and to start watching httpswatchargocomhttpswatchargocom
struggles with adhd anxiety depression and i was uncontrollably shaking and crying infront of her for the first time as well
2nd breakup we were supposed to go out of town but i had a call from my depressed bestfriend who lost his job due to the pandemic and is needing comfort bec he is alone that time
it is like i can not be okay because then i remember he will be okay and we will not be okay together just apart does that make sense i love him and want the best for him i selfishly want to be part of it
my heart constantly hurts in a lingering pain of wicked loneliness each and every night i try to sleep i feel my heart cave within itself
things were simple and now they are not she blocked me on all social media but still will text me some times
and i do not want to feel this way for years i am so tired of waking up everyday and feeling the same
my parents invited me to spend the night in their place i said maybe my father sensed that something was wrong and came to my place and i could not say a words without crying
struggling to handle the thoughts of her moving and living her best life while i am miserable bitter in myself for not putting in the effort in my own life looking forward in life i do not see a way to be happy and get past this
enough to affect my work so i took a couple of days off to cool down and put things into proper perspective after having sought some assistance for it through a service my work place provides
i have been depressed since the summer of 2016 lots of things happened that year and the darkness in me keeps growing
i then go to feeling almost empty like my soul has vacated my body along with all my feelings and drive and will not leave my bed for days
but hes going through so much right now so so so much that i can not even fathom going through it at our age
it is so hard because no one did anything wrong we broke up saying we love each other it is not healthy or fair for either of us to be in this position and it just sucks
i recently got into a long distance relationship and i was thinking how i do not know anyone where he is so i just thought to myself who would tell me if he dies i just have this feeling that he is going to die and i know i am being unrealistic but i can not shake it off
i called 911 and they told me the area code was a city in florida so to call the citys police department
i wish i would die in my sleep i wish i still had my prescription so i could down them all i hate this no not hate i can not even feel that anymore all i do is wake up eat excrete repeat i do not see the point to anything anymore
now it is just me letting my thoughts loose and seeing what other people think and what advice you have for me
i did not want to seem crazy if i was wrong here but i was still very doubtful i am stuck indoors in my feelings
i cried myself to sleep every night that was easily the worst time of my life i used to be creative a talented writer now when i try to do something creative it is pathetically derivative
and that my parents have been arguing and ignoring each other making me pick sides please someone help me get off this emotional rollercoaster
i still do not know if that is enough to have this in the form of jewelry i do not want to try and be something i am not and i do not want to claim i have something when i do not because i know how hard life is for those who have gone through suicide attempts and self harm before
i cannot take medication for it therapy does not help and it just keeps getting worse everything just keeps getting louder and louder in my head
so of course i comforted her assured her i will be by her side no matter what we can work through all of this it can all be fixed we just need some time to figure things out
it was not a big deal when it happened and that feeling has not changed at all i am very dazed and feel like i am just going through life without thinking
i have alwaysed had this low lying sadness over my life but i never bought into it due to just forgetting about it and living a kids life
avoidant behavior may commonly be seen in children or adolescents but a diagnosis of a personality disorder cannot be made in childhood because shyness fear of strangers social awkwardness or being sensitive to criticism are often a normal part of child and adolescent development
she says for her something is missing but she can not pinpoint what it is this confuses me as how does she know we can not work through it if she does not know what is missing
when i said these things to her she took offense to them and rightly so because i am clearly in the wrong for going about it the way i did but again i never meant to hurt her i was honestly just wore out and want her to feel better so we can continue to be happy and be in a strong loving relationship
i still initiate and contact people but i keep doing it less and less it went from multiple times a day to once a day to once every two days to once every week right now if i just keep making the distance longer nobody will notice
next day she told me that she was sick entire day and that she can not handle that any more than she went cold for about 2 weeks that was in september
then apparently this pissed off the customer and rightly so they stormed into our main store and they confronted the inside online shopping management
today be present give yourself a few moments minutes to be in the moment through whatever that is you love doing meditating being outside writing painting etc etc i wish you health happiness healing gentle soul you are loved cared about
my mom keeps blaming every other family member for his suicide she thinks she was a perfect mom in general she thinks she fucking perfect seriously she is so arrogant stubborn and entitled but she is emotionally abusive and always has been
first my grandma died she was like my only friend trough all these years she was all alone at home same as me we kind of could relate about that and overall she was like the only person that always believed in me
this girl seems to get attached to every guy she talks to and i am one of themwas however it seems as if she ends up liking the guys that are hard to get and do not fight for her
lol i hope one day i cut deep enough because fuck this shit manhave not really spoken to anyone this week so i am making this to make me somewhat happier
i have only had sex on 4 occasions 3 of them being almost blackout drunk i have only really made out a handful of times too again drunk
i am sure that she has dwelled on that for weeks until her future plans were certain i felt it the transformation of our daily interactions from warm to cold intimacy dissipated highlighting our present incompatibility
my parents divorced when i was 4 but i still visited my mom all the time despite her living 1 hour away
i felt okay yesterday but i want to end it rn the other half of me thinks while this break is hell for me its a relief for her
i asked my ex at first if she wanted to try again she said ok maybe again in the future but after a few weeks when she moved on and became cold i asked her the possibility of us being together again she said i do not know we will see how
i feel massively ugly and am paying for my bad decisions now its hard to recover when your symptoms from neglect are still there
we broke up almost a month ago we have spoken since then but it is flakey at best i was hoping she might want to talk like we used to or we could slowly build up what we had but i am starting to think that is not on the cards

i believe her bf found out her and i was talking so she got scared and blocked me i know she also have to respect him
her friends have told me this is a rebound and that they know she is avoiding her problem and is an emotional mess
i hate that i am not strong and intelligent like the others i hate that i am troubling those close to me just so i can feel solace
some back story we were having issues for awhile because he was always busy with work now as he started his medical residency
i know she sees that i am hurting but as always i do not want to burden anyone else with my problems and i can sense the strain it is putting on our relationship
i was almost positive i was going to die alone because nobody would want me and when you asked me out i broke habits so i could be better for you
he is extremely smart but poor in decision making he topped his university in engineering and worked as a civil engineer
it was christmas i think i was 9 our family is quite poor dysfunctional but my mother and her boyfriend would always get us my siblings and i a christmas bear with the year written on the foot even at that young age i knew that we could not afford much and i just could not understand why we kept getting these bears when i would rather something more practical clothes shoes etc
i do not believe this is going to help here and i know i am not alone but still i just wanted to say how i feel to someone
i want to be happy and enjoy my life but i do not know how me22 and my gf22 of 3 years broke up me and my gf had been dating for 3 years
i feel like i pushed him away with my insecurities from the break up i wish he loved me the same
my parents work from home but barely look at me during the day they tell me to get off of my phone but that is the only way i can feel less lonely
you left but everything i allowed you to be a part of in my life is still here and i am stuck with it all having to do it all without you
i know we have ambitions and there are many things we would like to do and achieve but i would like you to take a pause just for a moment and think about what is at stake
i am almost 30 so it is going to be 20years of being depressed it would be so easy to just kill myself and be done
it is like a part of my emotional make up now it is become the norm i do not have much work to do so i have too much time thinking about how alone i am almost everyone that i care to spend time with is quarantining
my mom keeps telling me i have to wait until i am 18 to get a piercing but i do not plan on being alive past then so tf do i do
among the classmates some weirder then others there is this overly and i mean suspicious level of overly nice and friendly guy from now on i will call him tim
i am 19 and i live in australia i think i have been depressed since my father died to now but i have never been checked and after i moved out i do not want to because i am scared of it effecting my life later and getting overperscribed medication
i am an introvert valuing my time alone and finding a lot of satisfaction in work and hobbies but at the same time i am tired of being the only person in my life i have family nearby but they have their own lives and do their own things so i am very much on my own
we have created a declaration of war to our negative mind i have work in 6 hours and i still have not fell asleep
i hate hate hate the how are you question it is my natural reflex to reply with i am fine the truth i am lonely sad do not really know what i am doing with my life and i am going down a career path that i do not enjoy but no one wants to actually hear that so why ask that question
coupled with that my mom is really worried about covid and i have not been allowed to leave the house all december
now at home my husband leaves for work before 630 am and before the covid19 curfew would occasionally work late and when he does come home early he decompresses by playing hours of video games i do not begrudge him that and i do not think he is responsible for making me feel less lonely but when he snaps on his headphones and immerses himself well i might as well be alone
incels are monstrous in their hatred and the entitlement i have to say i do not ever feel entitled to friendship or love
i had a dream that my ex was with someone new established and everything he would not give me his cup instead he got me my own actual lemon water
today i was actually napping and she came to wake me up and i said okay i will get up and she called me a rude bitch and slammed my door
my ex and i dated for 6 years on and off the last time we got together he wanted me back said he was a changed man and wanted to try again me being the naive young women i am believed him
i am doing my residency in medicine and every day i am struggling to meet the standards that i feelknow i am not reaching
last week due to an unrelated issue i had to go into hospital and while there they did a check on how my organs were doing after the od they came back saying that they do not know how but i have managed to pull through against all odds
actually now that i think about it it is more of an itch and it definitely only happens when i think about what is happening to my grades
at this point i was always going over to his house i was always trying to find ways to make him happy and this continued for the next few months
i have been grieving ever since and i am asking you guys am i in the wrong heredo not share your popcorn at the movies with anyone
the sense of only living for today as if this is the only day i have but as well as that our life is long that we will live for another 30 40 50 60 years etc
she responded we are very happy she was cold and explained she and he rarely fought and if they did it was civil and resolved
the reasons are so stupid and i can not tell anyone because it is embarrassing i do not want anyone to pity me or use my insecurities against me
edit i forgot to saynow if i ever do something wrong or irritate her she will say i miss my son like thanks for making me feel like a piece shit who should have died instead of my brother
my verbally abusive narcissistic mother started a fight with me but i got blamed for it as per usual only reason i did not do it today was to not ruin christmas for my little siblings
for the last week or so my girlfriend has blatantly told me that she does not want to be with me anymore and does not love me
you do not joke around about someone you love like that so i simply said with the calmest growling tone i could muster
he was sorta the last man standing and i never knew him to have a girlfriend or even so much as a date

the body i have is the body i am sticking withi want to fucking jab a fucking knife into my throat so i can die
i know he and i have some differing opinions on university and he having gone through some stuff recently i felt extremely guilty mentioning that
looks i can too but hes saying nonono you do not need itso what a total first of all i want to ask how you move in that situation
i know that people become lonely after a breakup but i can not relate at all as i said before i have never even felt love i have definitely liked a girl but never got anywhere with it
but when she talks i feel like she is trying to talk to someone else she looks at me like she is seen a ghost and i ask her questions and she never respond
i feel so lonely and it is terrible i do not even know how to deal with it i have never been this lonely before
by around december 2018 i told her that i liked her te quiero which in spanish is like a previous step before i love you and did this with ease
he took it personally and has not really contacted her since not even congratulated her to her pregnancy offending him was not her intention
i never thought i would be able to fight for this long i certainly never thought that i would find someone who pushes me to fight
she maybe tried for about a week but then very clearly stopped caring it is been like that since basically my head is a mess
i kind of feel better now after writing this and whenever i try to give or find an explanation about why i am feeling the way i am feeling it always kind of helps me to feel better because i know emotions are just a biological thing there is nothing magical or spiritual about it really it is just your brain and body reacting to certain things around you
normally i do not do these things about posting my problems on the web but yes i think it is time to do something
there is no reason to keep going and i have waited so long for any indication that i should live and i have not received one that is convinced me that it is worth living and suffering more
i was super confused and approached her about it and she went back again saying we are just friends again i was understanding and accepting of it
so i am not sure how i am going to make it happen in my life i am staying at home recently my life is not going anywhere and i am slowly going crazy with loneliness
every terrible thought i could think of just like came to mind every self doubt i have ever had every bad experience i have ever had just flooded in all in one moment
some of you may know my background story if you do not well here it is about 9 months ago i started chatting to a guy via dating app
driving down the road to depression but have something is that are keeping me sane and afloat please i do not know what to do with myself
i could solve the problem of how not to get bogged down by depressive moods here and there and keep going strong in web dev
some loneliness even after the source has been dealt with can linger these emotions can have such a strong impact on the individual that feeling alone is practically a natural state and anything outside of their confirmation bias towards despair is deemed a fluke or delusion
but i am a dumper i am constantly second guessing every decision i have ever made along with the feelings you guys have that you will never find anyone better that we loved each other so much that we should just give it a second chance
we are still good friends and i am i credibly grateful to have given you my virginity but i will always miss you and really wish we could have stayed together
god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference reinhold niebuhr picturehttpswwwinstagramcompb93ep1ibbrp
my self esteem basically does not exist i have good grades at school but i study everything last minute and somehow pull as and bs
it was all around not good for me and i felt like i tried to give him my whole world and i carried this whole relationship on my shoulders
as time went on my uncle left messages one threatening to kill my fatheridk if i am just using any and all excuses or just super on guard with my heart
i have meet a lot of different women by being out no dating apps the nights were i am lonely is becoming easier to deal with
my boyfriend has been really depressed lately and dealing with the lose of his dad 2 years ago he told me last night he is had a gun to his head several times in the last week or so i asked him to lock up his guns and he said no but he is worried he is getting closer to following through
i initiated no contact with him and he had sent me an email stating that he does hope that we can be friends in the future and he attached links about selflove the email was so touching i cried and i really do hope that he and i can become friends in the future but i think the emotions are too strong now i hate how lonely i feel
my hobbies have not changed since i was a teenager i like to watch movies and play games get lost my fantasies
heck i am even thinking of throwing away some dreams i have due to how much i have to put in for the reward
it is been 10 years since my first suicidal thoughts i was only 11 since then i have been thinking about it at least once every month then every week now it is hard to remember a day that suicide it is not present in my head
but i still can not seem to heal from things that happened to me so long ago i prefer to open up a discussion if possible about loneliness being treated like a mental disorder
all the social media that i use to fill my time when i want to relax only makes me feel worse people in big groups going to the mountains visiting each other on christmas doing activities and so on
the 1 or 2 i did have were toxic and we fell out and they both do not like me one actually hates me
because in some cases our work kept us from socializing or did not make us realize how lonley we are and know we can finally work on this
i feel like i want to mutualize myself until i need to go to a hospital maybe they will help me or something
you imagine the scene the music in the background all the lights dimming to darkness and them showing from behind you like they came for you after all
my boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me two weeks ago and he has no reason to have done it
or if you already overcame it what was the solutionthis is probably not that serious of a problem sorry i just needed to get that out
i am also like holy fucking shit i am on the verge of suicide and you say this to me so what do i do just spam the shit out of her in the beginning i write insulting shit back it was kind of a blur so i do not know what exactly
i blame you a lot for the misery that was put upon me but i can not help but blame myself now
i tend not to make friends with many people but when i do i get far too comfortable far too fast and basically tell them my entire life story within a week of knowing each other
at the time he told me i was so angry and upset but after talking about it and finding out things i probably should not have searched on his devices i should not have it is made it so much easier
i would act out or talk out loud as if someone was with me let us say i was going to sleep i would imagine someone is with me
anyways i expressed i chose to have no involvement in how her bf handles her and my exs friendship and the truth but i can try to be a friend as much as it hurts
yes i have moved on in many ways i got a better job and am progressing more in a hobby plus i have gotten back in touch with a lot of old friends
you do not just go out in them then force yourself to wear them similarly if you have a thought and if you do not like that thought
i know there would be a much higher chance on my motorcycle but theoretically what would the chance be in a car if you are going to comment something about i know its hard do not i am not saying this is a suicide plan i am just curious even if it was nothing someone over the internet says would affect that decision
hope you liked this little excerpt full longform posts can be found right herehttpsmaxjancarcom on my blog i have been practicing it and it helps me stay insane
you are going to think about them at least and you will check up what they are upto it was going really well my boss and i clicked instantly and we became very close friends
i like this girl but she rejected me like every other but i am still friends with her and idk why but i can not cut myself lose from her we have been friends for almost a year now and like 7 months since she rejected me
but when things settle down and i am left with just my thoughts that is when it gets difficult that is when the impossible becomes possible
he also works in hospitality so his hours are odd and said he used to hook up with coworkers all the time
things were getting so much better and we were each others first everything i just want to know where his head is
i want to talk to someone about it to try and get some help but but that is not how you get me to stop
i broke down finally realizing this now i can not look at anything without my brain bringing my thoughts back to her
i still would like to go out and meet people and walk in the park and stuff but because of the current covid19 restrictions that just makes life harder for me
my ex has communication issues he ignores me talks about me to other people etci have completely lost my trust and confidence
i do not want to explain the circumstances but they are still vague i do not know if it was something specific i did
i try movies reading games but everything seems shallow and right after this feeling of emptiness comes right back i am constantly paranoid and afraid and confused i have always felt like i had an ill fated life that
ever had that convo with them where they only fire away without listening to anything you say you probably forgave them and said
but it feels like i almost hav two separate personalities in my head one for being a boy and one for a girl
i guess i will get into it my gf and i dated for 4 yearsfirst it was anger that i had not bought my first flat earlier
i m becoming more and more suicidal my exams are coming and i cannot bring myself to study plus i do not particularly like what i study
id like to believe its hallucinations but i seee soooooooooo much things which just can not be hallsometimes i can control people absolutely seems hes decide when and who and who can not
i do not know how to explain it my vision is always somewhat moving and colorful there will always be other guys but they will never be you
my friends are all telling me he is emotionally abusive and is just looking for a reaction out of me and it is so hard for me to stay quiet when all of these things are happening
i have lost weight since then not all of it but i have not done anything more with my life i medicate largely with comedy but it is impossible not to sometimes feel a great sinking and the need to sit with it
i am feeling so lonely and just wish we could be happy together but i doubt that is going to happen i left her a christmas message and i guess we will see if she sends one back but i am starting to feel like i am never going to meet someone i like who feels the same
but i also think about how many times i begged for compliments and never received them i still think about the first time i told you i loved you and it was not reciprocated
another thing that bothered her is the fact that my parents do not accept my sexuality and she is never met them because of it
i feel like to be this alone is just a foreign concept to everyone because everyone always just makes excuses for me
couple months later we had moved in together no mom to avoid any equity drama he put his name on deed and i bought furniturepaid the absurd hoa
does it get easier the heart ache the constant crying when the kids are asleep i am so lost and broken and do not know where to start
i do not want to see myself as the new ingeborg bachmann and you as my max frisch only to write you over 250 letters so i can die due to an overdose
i feel like a normal person trapped in the mind of this autistic prick i am all alone for christmas it seems fitting for the last one
everyone can give me that same bullshit speech it is all hard work yes but you need luck you can work all your life but someone needs to open the doors for you
no therapist but he is being more open with me and i feel us reconnecting despite the disappointment about him not trying harder for therapy but i knew i could not keep pushing him if he himself did not want it
the depression can still get bad sometimes but i am no longer in the dark about it for the most part i can take care of myself and i trust myself not to let it get as bad as it once was ever again
i find that i am always working because it is the one thing that keeps my mind of stuff it annoys me seeing everyone getting girls and getting in relationships but me
i do not think i would ever do it because i am scared of dieing but recently it is just gotten worse which is why i am reaching out because before it was just this feeling every now and then
thought that i am not only one feeling this way makes me even more sad i want all of people like me to go outside and feel happy and have friends and great lives
because of what happened it is not possible for my brother to go abroad anymore we just do not have the money anymore
i have felt lack of emotional connection from him yes but he is caring kind and funny and we are so similar and like the same things it is scary
maybe i am just making excuses but that is the only reason i am alive i do not think they even realize how much they mean to me
i have been a sad person for 53 years now and it never gets better i know with 100 honesty my mother loves me
but it just so happened that i started talking to this girl and we have been talking so much and it helps alleviate the pain
it is been 3 months since we broke up and he until tonight has yet to address the breakup we have been talking for 3 yrs
i have never dealt with anything like this so i really do not know what to do i gave that relationship my all it was not enoughwill try to keep this as short as possible
in the past few years i started to believe that if there is one person who can understand my messed up life and has the strength to guide me out of this hell hole it is her
i am introverted as well and do not have many friends here my country is in the midst of political turmoil and covid19 prevents me from seeing my family as much
comparing my life to a stupid video game like an idiot i am going crazy actually i lost my parents at a young age subconsciously she was a bit like a mom to me
currently i am more lonely than i was back then and sometimes i want to start doing that again but then i realise what am i doing and why
i did not think i was going to remember as much as i did back to the point of this post
or that i have to wait for them to eat when i eat a certain hour 15 pm and they eat a an hour later 1600 or 1630 because they are not hungry when i am
remember that time i forgot where my car was parked and you yelled at me the entire time i think of that day when i have thoughts of getting back together with you
she wanted to remain friends i said yeahi 25m have realized that i can not actually think or for that matter do anything without writing it down
i am gay and have not told anyone i live in a country where it is not excepted and i believe and follow a religion which says that people who participate in gay activities should be stoned to death on a tall building and that they will forever rot in hell but i still firmly follow it
for example imagine everything from positive things like first kisses childbirth new inventions discoveries art pieces to atrocities like robberies murders wars childrens abduction fresh affairs recent breakups and ughtraffic jams be sure that you do not judge any of your thoughts and experiences like in zen buddhism simply observe them and resist making any attachments to them
they want to spend time with me and try to make the best of the holiday season but i do not want to be with them at all
my ex and i have been in pretty regular contact over this time and started talking together in the way we damn well should have all those years ago
you have a reliable repair and upgrade service that can advise you in what upgrades are and are not possible and perform the work with experience and the proper equipment
i feel like he wasted my time i do not know what to believe anymore he told me he still has feelings for me
that will release all sorts of mixed emotions and feelings running through your veins and will allow you to embrace the fact that someone you loved so deeply just dumped you for whatever reason
my mental health depends entirely on her which i realize is very unhealthy and that i should move on but i just like her so much
i also was hoping today somebody would call me and chat but no such thing happened my mom called me to wish me a merry christmas and i love her for it
so 6 years ago i decided i am going to try to run a marathon i would never done it before and many mistakes were made that year i did not even finish because i tripped and twisted my ankle scraped my knees and ruined my runnning shorts this marathon my parents let me know i obviously could have done better but i did not try hard enough
moral of the story is you can do this the pain does not last forever you can save yourself and make something good from this completely horrific situation
i was hesitant at first because some girls can just be really friendly like that but she made it pretty clear that she was interested
we read and did yoga together she stood by me through my depression and helped me reignite my desire to learn
i guess what i have does that to you but still does not get easier with time or therapy years of therapy though i am only a 17 year old woman
i used to have like 12 friends i would get together with if not once a week then every other week or so
your past is just a lesson not a life sentenceknow when it is time to walk away for your wellbeing and theirs
god why do i even need to exist what is the point i do not want a family i do not need to be successful and i do not care about any of it
has anyone ever been not sure that they had a panic attack the other day i was showering and i think i had a panic attack but i am not sure
she tells him she does not know what he is talking about the guy literally just calls to discuss errands and small things occasionally i checked the call log all calls lasted less than 30 seconds but to no avail he is sure something is up again
attempted to hang myself but could not bring myself to do it any easier methodsit is over nothing more to say so just wish me luck
i have come to realise when things are going not according to the plan or are going bad in general i actively make them worse on purpose although it seems like autopilot like i have no control in my actions in making it worse
i understand that to the max and i am trying to work on myself as much as i can in the meantime
today i was having lunch and coworkers behind me were talking about how they used to be wild in the past
we agreed to eat pizza and watch netflix and cuddle up she then sent me a message on facetime with
tried to commit suicide by cop in november gave up and was locked up for a weekjust got banned from discord for talking about my feelings
some days it is hard you know that feeling very well i am just my normal self like before when they like me and they just stop
she knew all the keywords to describe her perfect relationship with someone who trusted her and she fucking lied like she exhaled air
i get almost no sleep and i can not get up in the morning without forcing myself this was just me putting my hands on a keyboard and saying my meaning
she is a wonderful mom to my baby brother who needs her but she is not the same to me and i do not think she will understand that
i am not being abused or threatened objectively i have it pretty good but that does not change the fact that i am not happy with myself
i really like the location and i do not think he visits him more than once a month is this a bad idea
so at this point if i do not sacrifice what i believe in i am going to be alone for the rest of my life
the lord of the rings painting and a naruto painting for the most of my life i have felt like i am different from my peers
i know that things will get better they definitely will its normal to breakdown no one is expected to be happy all the time
my girlfriend25f and i28m were in a perfect relationship until she had to move to a different city i loved her with all heart and it was all going fine until i fucked it all up
this is the thing i have been paying attention to his last seen on the app it seems like he only opens the app once or twice a week
i asked her but she just ignored me so i decided to get the atention of the guy so she should come talk for the last time
i know those are all cliches but i really just want each and everyone of you to know that if i can do it so can you 5 months ago i was a complete wreck thought my world was over did not think i would love ever again was not sure what happened everything changed so quick and after 5 happy years
it blows my mind how many men try to get their ex back guess what you should not you should never focus on getting or winning her back
hello i want to make a really long story short here and hopefully any of you out there who are feeling the same way or have anything wise to say can give me their two cents so here it goes
i heard my younger brother talking in his room instead of yelling at him i got up to check on him
all their tests show that my symptoms are small to non existent for now i genuinely do not want to see them
she was not just a cat she was my rainbow baby that got lost and not knowing what happened to her or if she is okay its getting too much
i look at the issues we have and i truly believe that i am in the right but everyone else just wants to pretend everything is ok and i do not feel like i am built that way
i get people do not know what to say but at the end of the day it is something i have to do
awkwardness but when it really has to do with his ocd and last the older i get the more the people around me are busy in their lives
this study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088after my ex and i broke up my first love i have been getting worse and worse
so now what do i do am i in the wrong for deciding not to reach out to him anymore for telling him he has to be the one to initiate contact i feel like the bad guy
dear reddit i have phrases that repeat in my head whenever i try to concentrate i keep being pointed to ocd by resources on the internet but the examples they give are always violating religion or letting family down
sometimes my mood is dropping so rapidly i feel i need to be in someone is company to prevent it getting too low
i am a lonely boy i love programming and reading bookshell who cares about sex whatever the heck that is it is been so long i really do not care
i do not know if it is appropriate here but i just wanted someone to talk to about this i am not really sure i want to stay around anymore
i am some months out of my mental health treatment therapy and medication because i am dumb af ontop of which at the time we were not dating
what we are going through sucks actually no sucks is an understatement but we should all have a release or something to escape to
to me it seems like he valued that friendship more over our relationship i know i did things to make him feel insecure but i stopped
my entire life this has bothered me but i never really pushed him to address it since his beliefs at the time were mostly harmless to others but about a year ago he approached me and told me my mother was having an affair
i hoped we will move somewhere else after a month because well there is no place to work or no one to talk to really because there are only old people around this area and i do not understant local language
i feel selfish and pathetic i just want her back if it is meant to be we will find each other again but for now i need myself
now the wedding is over i almost have no anxiety no depression now she is telling me i need to take about 6 months atleast
sorry if my sentences have been not been cohesive or grammtically impeccible just a tad too overwhelmed to cater to those at the moment
i lost the love of my life and she hates me i do not know why but that is what my fucking mind is telling me
example being one time we went to the grocery store and she held my hand and she asked me if i had grabbed something
the old me with suicidal thoughts self harm destructive lifestyle and self hate is long gone i have got a good feeling about whatever is going to come
why am i still thinking about him found out he cheated and we broke up 5 weeks ago he has been in a relationship with said girl for 4 weeks he remains kn my mind and i am just so hurt 8 years down the pan for what for someone that happily slept with time when he had a girlfriend
for example the id has an urge to do drugs but the superego tells the id to not do those things the id does the drugs and the superego gets angry sending depressive thoughts or the id does not do the drugs and superego gets happy sending happy thoughts instead despite this the id will push these demands and the superego will have to yield sooner or later
i want to die i tried to die i have no onei was talking to him while he was about to attempt
i get how people will say this is actually the best thing for you and stuff but it just does not feel like that that is probably because i am still clinging on to the good memories or whatever i actually do not know because i was ok two days ago and then when i got to know he was with her it just all hit me again
we have christmas presents for each other that we are still giving to each other and still plan to remain friends and keep in contact
what i should be telling myself is that the only way to prevent isolation is to talk to people so even if it is not the most meaningful conversation or relationship it is still a conversation and a potential start to some kind of relationship
then lied to everyone in her circle and i tried telling her boyfriend and her father what happened but they would not even talk to me
i realized i have only lived happily and freely in my own mind i have never had the courage to live in reality
i was told she would not live the ideal life if you saw her in person today you would never guess anything was wrong with her but there is
she probably did not think it was anything serious but i did i miss the feeling of being needed and i wonder if its all even worth it
honestly i have no idea if it will be worth it continuing into 2021 and going on further and further into life i have genuinely been considering taking my life shortly before the new year so a scumbag like me can be left to rot in a shitty year
let me clarify what i mean by me being in denial most of the time my brain just tells me this never happened i never was with this guy and this entire relationship is just a random idea i have the other times i just think i will see him in a few days
anyway the point is that i am absolutely terrified i already told my therapist about my fears but we have not talked too in depth about it i am so scared of being happy with him feeling like we will be together forever and then break up it happens so many times so why that would not happen to me
throughout my late teens i had the weirdest of friends and experiences mostly good but there is one night i remember when being young that i will never forget the reason behind it has taught me many lessons i was around 20 years old
i would help you so much i ran errands for with you when you had no car after the crash i would stay up on nights talking you down from your anxiety attacks and mid life crisiss where you knew i had earlier shifts than usual
i was not relieved to be alive i felt no new resolve to live my life to the fullest or even at all and most of all the things that made me want to die are just as present and real as they were before i strung the belt around my neck
suits perfectly for me i feel used like someone she needed to hang out with before getting back with her ex
i need to complete an education fullyso we broke up and now i am struggling to stay his friend while also being in love with him
i know that these are not the only types of people who live and roam the earth but that is exactly how it seems like it
i helped you move into your apartment and the most hell came from your side of the family if i stay here too much i might actually freaking kill my self
and you may want to wait and you may hope that they will come back but hoping is doing nothing but breaking you down
a couple months later i started talking to my parents about wanting to propose and everything so a couple months later i finnaly pick out a ring
i am taking this opportunity to try to better myself so that i do not have to feel this way when the time comes down the road in a differentbetter relationship
and the one guy who like actually respects me is taking things too slow and i can not even tell if he is interested anymore
they tell me that i need to be doing things i have done countless times before or they will tell me that i am asking for too much and i need to be happy when i am alone
any advice should i try to talk with her leave her alone what is the best thing for me to do right now
i told her i did not think it was going to work because she wanted to be with the other guy she called me crazy and said how dare you it was at this moment i realised how easily she could lie i told her what i found and she tried to talk me out of it saying it was just girltalk i stuck to my guns and left
i planned to do this constantly for months until my mind became used to doing things without that feeling accompanying them but last night i managed to ruin that too and now i can not even listen to the environment around me without feeling like my head is going to explode
i want to know what is wrong with me this is a pretty unexplained paragraph but please help and although things were sorted out the day she left looking back now it did not seem enough
sometimes by doing something that i want that happens to be the same action with the compulsion or something similar i worry that i may be breaking the promise
but for the past few weeks i have experienced a radical selfdestructive change in attitude and mental state in response to the new normal
i had loved with all i had i assured her i will be back and i am still not over her
anyway i have been back in town for almost a year and i have not made any friends i have dated a few guys but it has not turned out well
i am in my 30s for the last six years i have been working for a well known technology company that ships products and services all over the globe i am at the front lines of the companys new and innovative products so it is expected that the role comes with challenges and stresses
she thinks what i tell her does not match what she is seeing no shitake i will post this rant on this subreddit and rdepression
my mother had chosen her boyfriend over her kids and entirely stopped caring for us i felt betrayed i was hurt
i able to talk to girls including my crush properly instead of getting nervous inside i do not have that feeling of loneliness killing me inside
got mad at me for not being supportive of work stress when asking to cuddle in bed she told me i may be a shitty person but i am not a shitty person who cheats
i have a medical background so i inserted an iv into my hand when i took it out it started bleeding quite a bit and just seeing that made me feel ok how fucked up is that i feel like i have lost my sanity
has anyone gone through something like this before and could you please share some advice i have been crying for the past 2 days when i broke up with her but mostly because she did not deserve to be hurt
the crushing feeling of opening up to someone and pleading for them to say i am sorry you are feeling this way i can see you are hurt you are going to be ok i promise and getting either nothing in response or i do not know what to say
but i just need to hear from someone anyone that they got through this feeling and came out with a successful happy and healthy relationship
since then i have just been absolutely sick to my stomach about my actions most days i just feel like a fucking predator because of what i did and i feel like this will be a mental scarlet letter i will have to carry to my grave
oh but surprise her sister never went to london and guess what since her sister did not traveled i could not go to stay with her for the festivities because i simply did not have enough money to stay more than a week there and my family would kill me and never help me financially to go to another country for these days so in the end i could not go
i tried going on dates but it did not workout then i tried dating apps but everyone there is looking for just hook up
everyday we start anew everyday is a new start to do something you wanted to yesterday its taking 1 step at a time and releasing the thought of finishing whatever it may be you want to work towards the journey of life is through the ups through the downs and everything in between what we have is our perspective our mindset and our presence
we were going to do it with our close on and it just happened 3 bottles of 200mg motrin 40 count all of these easy to swallow pills
i do not understand how i went so wrong in this life to be so unlovable to be so easy to leave or hurt as if i am a nobody
it feels like it was yesterday when i convinced yyyyy to write a gisletter to yousorry if sounds stupid can not post this on rnostupidquestionshttpswwwredditcomrnostupidquestions since anything related to suicide is not allowed there
i probably analyze my chin maybe 500 times a day i am always consciously thinking about it i probably have one of the ugliest side profiles in the entire world i want to kill myself every time i see it i am skinny and cannot grow a beard surgery also scares me i have tried to mew but can not breathe this is my biggest insecurity and i hate it i am so ugly
i have tried to write in a diary but there is too much in my head to put into wordshere is the thing i am currently living at a majority french speaking area in my country
i was meant to work at my summer camp again but all i did was live with my mum and rot
lilly did just start a new job and does have fwb maybe she is just busy and does not care enough to reach out anymore bc i am trying to date as well is this how it ends a fake argument a weird resolve where she still seemed angry and now after a very special year we never talk again
i have been onoff in therapy ever since i was a child because my mother suspected some kind of disorder but without results
i am clueless as to why it is all so sudden after about 2 days she messaged me asking for apology and saying me leaving is the last thing she want to happen
told him that i was not pregnant i am currently 15 weeks pregnant and that i was lying about it even though he is gone to ultrasound my stomach is clearly growing lol
we are both in college we had a mostly solid relationship besides a couple issues which never would really have been solved
last month he broke up with me accusing me of cheating on him because i talked to a guy and went out for coffee with him
i do not have a lot of family i am basically an orphan with abusive parents i disowned i am close with my brother but he and his wife live 2 states away
i have already been crying on and off all week but after she moved half of her stuff out and went to stay with her mom in the hotel i have been holding the kitten that we got together and crying like nothing has ever made me cry before
it took me months to get to 160 our 6 month old always has a smile on his face and loves to laugh
i am talking someone that is just so irrational for example she is currently antivax but not even main stream antivax like the next level
i know that i should not want that and at the end of the day i am certain that i would not take him back
so after reaching out to my friend who moved away about all my lifes woes he suggested i contact his sister
posting this more for myself than for comments but if anyone has any suggestions on how i can more forward please help a girl out 21f
i thought i was a disgusting girl and nobody would ever want me i was almost positive i was going to die alone because nobody would want me
everybody is alive against their own will therefore i should be able to just end it whenever i want without people stopping me
these kind of shows probably is just nothing to someone else but it had me bawling and asking just the right amount of questions it lifted my spirit like everything is okay
i miss going out for a coffee with someone texting someone to have a drink after work it does not help that i am really anxious at the same time about meeting people
i notice the small garbage pile the papers stacked haphazardly garbage forgotten to throw away etc5 years it did not work with the new guy and i feel so stupid
so my question is should i give her another shot or continue life without her like i have been i apologize if this post is messy and confusing i am new to reddit feel free to ask any question you have
it is 217 and i am listening to your music and doing drawings i once said it would suck if we broke up because i also love your art and well here i am i hope it is not over but it is
i have been working on it though and i am hoping that by posting here and just talking more about how i really feel i can get better at it i am sorry if this is really vague
i knew deep down it is been coming for a while but damn i did not expect it to hurt this badly my heart is aching he really is my best friend but i thought i would already done my grieving
anywaysto all the lonely people hererise and conqueroryou have no idea how good you have itenjoy itbe happyiam doomed iam already dead and have a murdered souldo not let it happen to youtrust meits only going to get worsehaha my heart crys everyday hoping for a better dayif only hahathat is my life and wellill take it
long story short i hold no grudge over cheating i am genuinely in love with her kind of pissed me off so i called to ask him for more clarification
edit hahahah i just realised where i was posting this wow i am such a fucking idiot just crying for attention i am sorry i do not know what i should do i want help but it feels like i do do not deserve it my mind is just screaming at me to fucking end it instead i am just typing a fucking post to strangers like it fucking matters
two days after he left i felt like something changed i messaged him saying that i felt he was being distant and wanted some reassurance
i know it is easiest to just tell them but you may as well be asking me to stick my head in a deep fryer
fearing the worst but stepsister asks i can go to stay with her mom in case we get the call that he is passed
i am so fucking envious he can play games with so many people and has so many good connections it is not fair he can game and talk to so many
i put myself in a situation where not only have i singlehandedly compromised my integrity as a man but i compromised my professional integrity by a long shot i feel like i screwed up royally the only way to fix things is if i meet my demise
i do not know how to find clients advertise myself operate a business pay my taxes i want to last until i can move away from here
fast forward to 3 days ago and they mentioned that it is gotten worse along with more things that popped up such as i make many more mistakes inconsiderate jumping ahead self deprecating jokes and stressing everyone else out more
however whenever i think of him i am flooded with memories and feel like my chest in collapsing most sadly is most the time i can not stand to be sober when i think of it all
i do not deserve happiness i try to challenge these thoughtsmaybe some of you have a problem that someone else has already overcome and we can share some tips
and yes me and a friend already told them that they should stop talking about specific topics because of reasons but they will not listen and just say yeah but this is how i am deal with it
i do not see anything left at the end of the road i do not know what i am doing with my life anymore i feel like a stranger to my own head
let alone talking to people let alone making friends let alone moving on with my life i wake up in pain
this is really just playing on my mind i can not stand myself at the moment i just want to be better and be happy for once
he saw beauty in my worst flaws and was my biggest fan with each of endeavours i could trust him he treated me like a queen
even though the person asking for a relationship did not react angrily in fact he was actually very friendly afterwards i still felt the same fear i had during my last relationship
now fast forward to the end of april 2020 just a few days after my birthday she asks me to have a threesome with her husband which i outright refuse
i am not very handsome but i would say i am pretty average maybe a little above average because i am tall and many girls seem to like that which is again bad design something absurd when choosing a mate
for years even way before my brother died she has been using me as her personal fucking therapist just talking about her own problems 247
2 professionallyfinancially i have a well paying job and financial stability i do not feel overworked and have time to unplug when needed i have great upward mobility prospects
i need to get rid of the expectations that he is going to text back and carry on like we are just the best of friends
at least then i would not have to force anyone else to break the news because most of the family is here
i am quite a clever person people say i am anyway so i also think people get tired of my conversation which means my position in conversation is usually just being sometimes reply guy
could you please give some feedback or leave a comment i will be immensely happy and grateful reaaally want to text her but she probably will not even respond
do not comment tips just feel bad with me people do not know how to feel bad with someone else when they need it
i feel a rush of sadness wanting what i do not have a soft warm feminine hand to stroke my hair and my neck and my shoulders and to take me in her arms
i always recognize how unreal these thoughts are if for example i am imagineing a hostile situation in school it is often to combat boredom in school i often imagine other scenarios in my head too i have a more harder time combating the selfloathing thoughts and they are the ones i struggle with
but these days i just can not find the motivation to do any of these being online makes my mental health so much worse and my anxiety has worsened so much because of it
we will get to where we want to go but most of the time it will be better than what we set out to achieve and that we expect that we will achieve keep doing your best today tomorrow and for the rest of the week until the end of the year work your hardest and leave it all on the field i wish you well
flash forward to yesterday i had deleted him from my friends list on playstation a bit ago and i was playing games with my friend out of all 7 billion people in the world guess who ends up being in the online game lobby we were playing in him
after saying goodbye to everyone my boyfriend found me after looking up my location on snapchat which i stupidly forgot to turn off he took me home and shoved his fingers down my throat to make me throw up the pills that had not already settled into my bloodstream then he called an ambulance and off i went to the hospital where they pumped me full of fluids and stabilised me
there are a lot of way to interpret this wordhello all i am wondering about some background of people here as far as reason origin of loneliness
i knew from the beginning that this was not going to be anything serious i am just mad that a man in this early twenties acted like a 13yearold i just wanted a fun time and got treated like trash for no reason
but i was hoping to fill that void with something better everything that has ever happened to me has been my fault i am evil
but if she comes back after i have forgiven her and tries to fix things once we have both gotten past this and grown i am not sure how i will feel
for example he bought a 70 inch tv for black friday he had to sell his mercedes because he was not affording the monthly payment but he still got a charger to replace that car he went to la for 5 days and he also bought a ticket to go see his friend in denver
i do not know what i am doing in this world i am barely existing can not call what i am doing living it is just during the end of last year and beginning of this year he is been extremely cold
in the end of course he did the right thing and chose to stay with his fiancé he has not spoken to me since
i just did not know what to say i only confessed her that i was unhappy with how she threated me during lockdown because she was super productive and i had to be too while i was just really depressed
i have been hearing your stories on how heartbreaking you are if you are needing some support i created a free ebook on how to get your ex back or let go of them for good my hearts been broken into pieces before so i know how painful it is miss them and to want to reach out
she was super shy and covering herself but then we gained confidence and we actually started talking like everything was normal i admit i was making a strong effort to not have an erection
every single day i write messages to her delete them again write them again her words just completely fucked me up
and only a certified doctor who has the criterion in his hand can evaluate it now to the second part and why self diagnosing is harmful to yourself
she told me she wanted to work on the relationship but she would start fights and random arguments until i end up apologizing
i am just a distant memory for most i feel this intense sense of loneliness i feel more friendly and confident i am working out again getting back into guitar
i know it is not going to be easy and will not happen soon but god damn i would love to be able to not want to burst into tears everytime i am slightly horny
how i am going to get somewhere how i am going to pay for college and medical school she genuinely is a nice person but her histrionics are so irrational
i am spending tomorrow as well as new years all alone i do not want to do this i hope you let me speak to you it fucking kills me to sit here and not see you
we did not end on bad terms however and he was just as sad as i was journaling and talking to people have helped me through my breakup
i want to do something useful but i do not know what i am not interested in feeling better i want to help someone else feel better i would prefer to do it anonymously because there is nothing honorable about showing off
it has really altered my life so heavily because my brain just kept repeating it 247 and i feel so fucking bad
i keep thinking about this episode in mad men where on of the main characters hangs himself and i keep thinking about how upset everyone was
my mentality will not let me do something like that willingly i get teary eyed whenever someone as much as hugs me
make things easier for them after all it is christmas day for them too in my opinion i come along just fine with everybody we work at six different groups
i do not believe it is a crazy mental health problem but i would like to know if it could turn into something worse
you get dressed you get out of the house and go see your friends but this does not mean i do not want one
i wish someone would come up to me and just hand me a gun and let me shoot myself in the head so i do not have to suffer for many more years
but one day my mom talked to a doctor on the phone and they think i have pcos and i am supposed to cut down on sugar exercise a lot and eat healthy

that power those strings blocked our own self development it is a detriment to give that to any one because it is meant for you you can share it but ultimately you should not hand your heart and power to someone else and if you are as torn up as i am it means you gave it to them
that was a red flag but he told me he lost feelings even before the break up things went too fast he was so sweet and so eager to be with me

he is deeply troubled and has been taking out his anger on me through emotional verbal and on rare occasions physical abuse
i always felt like a burden to her especially because she told me when i was younger that if it was not for me she would have committed suicide after the divorce

10 years from now there is very little chance that any of us will be very close we may still know each other and be aware of each others existence but no more the ogs
this year has been rough on me i have had brain surgery radiation immunotherapy and 2 kidney stone removals i am severely hard of hearing and can barely hear people talking to me and the person i relied on the most broke up with me after 11 years together

but something was just missing and it cannot be helped it definitely killed me to hear her say that she still loved me
i do not know if this was just love bombing a hard pill to swallow if that is the case but i truly think he did love me at that time
i was so excited for her to start the next chapter of her life she told me she could not wait until i was able to move there

i am 20 and i have been mentally unwell for a long time definitely since elementary school at least however my general lack of urge or impulse has kept me from outright self harming until i was 18
he talks to me in a very normal and friendly way he calls if he is around my house not to see me but just to chat
i really believe he will wake up one day and realise that is not the life he wants anymore if i just leave him alone

a group of friends that care about me and love me and eventually a girlfriend who is not fucking physically and emotionally abusive

any girls that i have met in person have shown no interest in me does that even make sense i hate seeing myself sad
so i can not fathom any good reason to keep living i am over 40 now am married and childless am working steadily at a job that pays ok
i tried being there for him in the ways i felt was acceptable giving space asking once in a while if he is still ok
i mostly had to do this on my own because these troubles are invisible and to get the right amount of help and social support is difficult because of taboo lack of awareness or knowledge social pressures and so on

honestly i only said i wanted a break because i thought he would at least try to work things out with me and tell me that it will be okay
i aldo do not think that my mom realizes how badly her words hurt me every day i get called something for little to no reason at all
i was so mad i called her out on it over text and she instantly denied it i knew i was right
i have an appointment with my doctor soon and will get back on the ssri i will be meeting with a therapist next week
i have been on 26 different medications i have had two full treatment regimens of tms i have had ketamine and ketamine was the only thing that helped but it lasts less than a month and i can not afford to keep up with treatments often enough for it to be worth doing
i feel so isolated and am severely depressed these days i do not feel like i have any motivation in life anymore how can i change this
she told me a few hours ago that she hallucinates a lot they are always really graphic do i hope it it will save my relationship yes it is 4 pages double space of pure honesty
i have never been happier but things started to change and the more and more it did the more and more distant you seemed
what adds to my tale of woe is that i am an atheist most days i can not get it over those dreams and feel so depressed because of it
now here is why it is not true there was no neighbouring patient she was in the hospital the whole time how should i explain it to her that what she saw and felt is not real
for the shitty guy i am i probably deserve a much much worse life i do not feel like facing my parents who have so many expectations from me for understandable reasons tho
due to this i am near overweight clinical depression anxiety disorder bronchial asthma affects my anxiety attacks greatly and minor insomnia
i need my job i like my job but the monotiny seems like it is triggering it but i do not know why i can handle the boredom it is whatever why am i suddenly panicking now
i am 18 male european currently in upper secondary high school for the most of my life i have felt like i am different from my peers
i am aware of the objective perspective and facts but pessimism always ends up winning in the end i always seem to side with what i want to believe in vs what makes rational sense
now she wants to be friends i can not really say no i was sincere with her i need to think she was sincere with me
when i can not talk to my boyfriend because he is working or hanging with his friends i get lonely do not have many friends that i can just call up i try to keep myself busy but sometimes it just does not help never been one that likes company often and now i do
i have no issues with watching porn but paying for individualized things crosses a major line which i would consider cheating if we are dating
through the time we have been together i have isolated myself more and more from people i feel like i am way too attached to her and she finds it annoying she is my best friend and the only person i am ever hanging out with we only see each other 24 days a week because she lives an hour away
i do not know what to do with my life i do not enjoy life i have never enjoyed it maybe i can enjoy a moment fuck that little things stuff life is not about the moments when you can forget the rest
i wanted to get in the way of her and her secret man to stay there and try to rekindle something but we could not be the same
for example if you think you will be anxious at a dinner party because you will have nothing to say google some good topics for conversation and learn how to be a good question asker
except she did not get it the first time around and he had to reiterate again that she needs to stop contacting him
i do not think i care to live on much longer if i can not escape my thoughts my life feels devoid of meaning
i can never do it i want him to keep living even though he is suffering because i will be sad when i remember him
because of my insurance i can only see one therapist at a time should i just pick my most important issue and see someone for that
then he ended it saying he realized he could not handle a relationship right now and he wished he realized this soonerhow he was sorry and loved getting to know me etc it is been a month and i have not heard a word but he watches my stories
want to know what it can not heal loneliness in fact time makes it worst much worse i am going to die the way i lived alone
when i do not remember if it was or not due to the combined stress of the job and the fear of my managers yelling at us
i just feel unwanted all the time and i feel everyone i talked to goes away so fast and it just hurts i feel so alone like i am damaged goods or just i feel people only used me when they need me
my family was so scared they thought they would lose me forever i woke up to see my family at my bed crying
i can not get them out of my head and the more i try to ignore them i am filled with dread and the overwhelming urge to do something irrational to myself
so any advice on how i can fare without destroying the progess that he made thanks a lot handling my mom and dads my siblings meltdowns today seeing my parents so hurt
all in all i am trying to become a better person i quit smoking 2 months ago i almost always work out
i really felt like i met someone who meshed with me after returning to school we started dating and it was like a dream come true
that was a treasured moment for me in our relationship but haha she in the end decided to leave me for someone who was better than me and literally told me the only reason she was with me was because she did not think she could do better
a few weeks ago after i went to a party with my friend she told me she would kill herself he just did not want to grow up
on sunday the topic of saying i love you and me having trust issues was brought up again i am not sleeping not eating and thinking about this situation constantly
i really do not need to your guys support or encouragement and please do not tell me to see a psychologist maybe maybe it is not significant
fast forward to now i am super horny miss the sex have no friends going through a nasty patch of depression and feel trapped in my life that is so empty i genuinely do not know how to socialize with other girls when i see them or anyone i really want to have sex with someone who i am attracted to and miss the physical contact of a person and right now i have nothing i am just a mess
and i know that if i did call me he would listen but i know it would not be the healthiest thing for me
i have not been able to go to any place to get a medical diagnosis so i do not say anything about anything to anyone
a lot of advice is do not dwell on it do not think about it do not spend time thinking about ithello i have been dealing with constant paranoia for the past 5 months
he really is the whole package and then some but something in my gut just was not sitting right in the relationship
i am already bargaining with myself and asking what if he promises to never drink again but deep down i know i have to move on
then they hype you up by explaining some broscience about how you can send their preprepared texts scripts and loveletters to somehow bypass your exes logical brain centers
i 21f recently broke up with my bf 21m it was not that he did something awful it was rather small relationship things that did not live up to my expectations that really disappointed me we were best friends before dating and he was truly my best friend all throughout dating
the thing is i knew it was wrong i was doing it to keep my brain busy to stop my hands from cutting me
i am uncomfortable in both situations it feels almost unstable and i am beginning to lose my own grip hardly even knowing what is going on anymore
there is no drug that is worth the pain it causes there is no drug that will satisfy you long enough there is no drug that replaces anything you lost or anything you want and most important there is no fucking drug that is as good as true love
i know a panic attack seems like a strong reaction but i am juggling many many emotions right now yes i know we all are but i am just trying to explain my situation
but eventually i realized it was serious and i needed to talk to my mom i showed her and she panicked the whole house panicked and everyone was freaking out because this had never happened before
but i did nottherpay ist just one talk every weak even if you stay on the station the rest is just boardgames
i just miss him so much and can not get him off my mind even if it was in a years time worst case
i keep being passed on from home to home for awoling acting out or just not meeting the expectations of my foster parents
it is like it is not as sensitive as it should be or once wasit is been years since i took an ssri but this numbing aspect of it has lasted a long time
its like i am living my life without control i have gone sober but nothing has changed i feel like there was no purpose things got a bit better but mentally i am still stuck in the same place i started at
tldr me going out of my way to research a subject and sharing it on a subreddit saved someone is life and i have never been happier knowing that i could do that
as the title reads i am a 21 year old guy and i have never been in any type of romantic relationship
i really do not have anyone else and it is really getting to me my mental health is in shambles my physical health does not feel great from a combination of just sitting at home all day every day and the only social interaction is get is going out getting wasted
i believe that they think i am autistic or something weird it makes my life boring and kind of unjoyable but i do not know if this has serious effects on me
it feels so long ago but the fresh mental wounds are still there what if i was not here no one would care
other days its a 10 and i am smashing things into my head until i bleed so that my pain can be seen on the outside
so tear down the pedestal on which your ex resides and reclaim your power i tried my absolute best for her
i do not want to go on living anymore i fuck everything up for everyone things were going super well her friends and family liked me and her and i would call every night
what is wrong with me why do i feel these waysshe responded and told me that she and my ex were together for over a year
despite what i do i will wake up tomorrow because i love my mother and solely my mother enough that i would never hurt her
i first posted here last july deleted the post during a mental breakdown and shame two weeks after i posted it i felt so lonely because i thougth people around me just ignored me and considered my as an idiot
i feel like i manipulate people without realizing it and i just i am so tired i do not want to have to think anymore
if you read this far thanks i do not have someone to grab drinks with so it is nice to just get it all out
so i am forced by my anxiety to mak promises to gods that i will not do the compulsion and i ask for punishmentscurse in case breaking the deal by doing the compulsion
this time i broke up with him and he decided he was done and he said he was tired of me breaking up with him and i would try to point out it was because he was not changing for real
look i am married and do not get me wrong i love my husband but i honestly do not even know if he actually loves me back in the same way
i am told by my family my depression has taken over me i am not the same person anymore my best friend of ten years is gone everyone i knew in the past is gone
i am fine with that i just do not want to go crazy like chrischan seriously mentally ill crazy i noticed i start getting paranoid sometimes i do not trust people usually but lately i assume they want to hurt me somehow
it just hurts so muchthanks for reading and happy holidays to you allit is just chronic emptiness depression and self hatred every fucking day
and we will i know too that there is some people that are very passionate about some things that they like and is not by any means the same to experience it with an actual physical person than online
i think i am nice looking but really i just want to be put out of my misery and maybe that is okay
i finally found someone at the beginning of this year that had a genuine interest in me and i fucked up an ruined it i ended up blocking her and i really regret it but what is done is done these fuck ups keep happening and it feels like i am digging myself deeper into this shit
it got to the point where he would only accept my sexual history if my first boyfriend was raping me because he wanted to be the first person i would wanted to have sex with it got to the point when he would speak to me like this i would break down and be inconsolable for ages sobbing and sobbing utterly worthless he would apologise and we would reconcile i felt so crushed in those moments
then he suddenly moves on to tell me that he does not like that i am talking to my friends about him and how it is all bad stuff about him
i try not to even think about the idea of just simply existing and connecting with another person on a basic level because i remember that something like that has never ever been an option for me
i can not find a group to be part of and being alone is scary i have no force of will to progress on my hobbies
i took my dressing gown cord and tied it round my neck and tried to tie it to a branch in the garden i was struggling to tie it while holding myself up on the branch and eventually gave up and just broke down crying
i do not know why they were like that i suppose it was because they thought i was being treated in a special way or something
i asked her if we could take a break instead and she said she will think about it i just love her so much and i do not want to end our relationship
i do not believe in god but when ever the voice speaks of god and how i failed god i get really sad and almost do it it becomes harder to breathe and my heart starts hurting slightly and my body shakes a little some times
i am currently deployed and though i am never really physically alone i feel trapped in my head i cried for her really bad then
i hope they fucking realise that i was crying for help for months but they were having so much fun that they could not be bothered
iam desperately trying to heal and be that cheerful girl again going for therapies using anti depressants doing yoga try to meditate go for long walks and spend time outdoors trying to open up to my close friends again and spend time with them i do journaling etc etc but really nothing seems to help
i have learnt my lesson pretty well and i cried the tears of blood questioned myself and my self worth but now i know it is you it is you who is not worth my love
then i took a day or two to wake up from it and began trying to socialize without talking about it so i would not relive any of it
i am writing this because i am feeling empty using a throwaway so i can throw it away and never come back to it it might annoy people a bit because i am going to be fairly blunt about myself and i am far from a perfect person i am hoping selfawareness may help soften the effect
now with christmas coming across i was feared that all the bad fellings overwhelm me but i am feeling surprisingly good
i do not want to make her feel like that again but it is so hard to keep fighting i love i really do i know it
i am a hard working student and everyone knows that i love to help others but i just feel like no one ever considers me as a friend
even though this is not directly addressed to her i sent it to her idk if i should not have done that but i felt the need to let her know how i was and still am feeling
i work at the same place as my ex who broke up with me nearly 4 months ago how embarrassing sometimes i would legitimately sit in the hallways reading
the way i think and the things that bother me are so incredibly taxing on myself and others and i see that these things only frustrate and hurt others
i tried to open up to my mother i said to her i feel like everyone hates me and she went oh oh you think evryone hates you and went on about how disrespectful terrifying and pathetic i am they always say i can go to them if i need anything like support or whatever but i do not trust them at all now
everything was normal except i am getting tired of him not cutting off her ex he said that he is going to treat me better and make this work
i just put a fuck ton of propranolol pills in my mouth and spat them out like a fucking pussy i do not want to be a nuisance but some shit has happened which is kind of dumb but i just feel like such shit and i feel really lonely and would appreciate someone to talk to about it
me at the time agreed with her not knowing how much pain i would be in for her not to be apart of my day to day life
but is it hard for you i am not sure i will ever know all i want is for you to come back home
i just want to stop feeling so much pain i miss them so much i want them back i just want to get over them too i want to be happy again
i know your hurting but what you have to realize is god i feel like i am going nowhere at a fucking breakneck pace
i got a ft job so it a year ago pandemic hit he lost his job and went home to do construction for his younger brother
i know this does not belong here but i am just so lonely and sad and terrified i am not anxious i am just empty i do not want him to die but i also do not want to live with all the uncertainty and pain and anxiety i love him so much
all of that being said when we talked last night she said how she does not think this can be worked out right now or while we are in a relationship and that we do not have to be apart forever ect
i got less tolerant about her protests regarding the relationship and slowly started to resent her and snap at her a bit
she thought we were still together and so every time she was affectionate i told people she was convinced we were dating because we would kissed a few times
i am just not always on mobilei check but i cannot spend too much timeon chatting i did that when we were a couple but i had many troubles
he called my previous employer asking if i was working that night and they explained i quit a few months back
i never had dreams about you while we were in a relationship but now it is every night i can not get you out of head a few nights ago i had a dream you killed yourself and i woke up crying my eyes out and heart broken all over again
i told him i would wait for himbecause he is the one i envisioned a future with because he is the one that said he would love me forever and seven because he really had me convinced we could do it he is the one that was still bring up memories in our relationship even when it ended
i made a post on here earlier but i just want someone to give me some hope i feel none towards the future not my own individual future but the future of the earth so many people are saying the end is soon and i know of way too many scenarios and i just feel impending doom constantly i do not see a point in living if there is not a future anyways someone please help me
but i do not know what to do to make sure that does not happen i do not know that i will not attempt it again tomorrow
i wish you all nothing but love and happiness you will not always feel the way you do nowi am actually sick
yesterday i was thinking how much would be beautiful to relay only on myself to be able to appreciate time alone and loneliness to take relationship with others in a easier way but unfortunately i am not able to do it
instead of apprecaiting me in my possible final moments you leave and do not look back you simply do not care her family does not deserve to be hurt by me anymore either this world would be better off without me
tbh i think a lot of people do not respond to my posts because as my username implies i am gay i really just wish ppl could put all that aside and just answer my question because i would really like to know
i feel like i lost myself i depended on you so much i catered towards you so much i was afraid to make you upset with my words or my actions i wanted to make you happy i wanted to be in your company being in the same room or house but not having to do things with each other your presence was all i wanted i should not have depended on you so much
then finally i had her over at my place so we could cook we danced to music and kissed for the first time
and a part of me feels that a six month absence will end up with me and my friends drifting apart even more
they say the hardest part is not awareness but the application from the awareness and i guess i am in that part of my journey now
you may not be okay now but there is a possibility that one day you will be just one more day please and another after that keep going because you stumbled across this and this is me writing directly to you keep going we will do it together
i try and try to spark conversations but i just do not know how to turn sporadic messaging into an actual friendship
funny enough she has never allowed me to find a job or even try for my drivers permit money was great however it destroyed my developing body i suffer from chromic pain now
i will have to look at these things every day and be reminded of the christmas i got drugged and raped 3 days prior to it
the best thing people say is give her time she will come back but when people say move on you will find someone better or she is not coming back i just can not stop myself from thinking about suicide
i am pretty childlike but he entertained that side of me and he had a supercute laugh he gushed to me about how much he cared and how important i was to him at one point he gave me tons of kisses and hugs and cuddles and made me feel so important
i am alone and lonely my dog is the only one keeping me alive right now each and every year my holidays are the worst part as i am reminded on every corner that i am alone lonely and miserable i do not have family that cares for me i do not have any friends at all this year i did not even had the power to pull out the christmas decorations
also which i am very worried about he has a friend which he did not like much in the past when he was still more normal now that she is into that spiritual stuff he enjoys talking to her she claims that she can talk tocommunicate with trees and he believes her i think she is a bad influence and just a support for his mental instability
guys process their feeling differently guys go through a breakup differently and you may want to wait and you may hope that they will come back
i could never really get close to people because i thought they hated me and i did not want to get close to people because i did not want my death or drama to affect them
and i will worry about this until something else happens we get so wrapped and immersed into someone is elses identity that we think we are the broken one
everything feels very far away and disconnected except for my friend and my boyfriend i do not know if i could do it without them and that thought is scary
i feel unequipped to handle everything and feel like i am just this scared teenager on the inside even at the age of 22
i would have to tell myself in the third grade that even once i made it out of elementary school even when i made it out of middle school even when i made it out of high school even when i made it out of college and got a real job i still cry and and yell things when i am alone and noone can hear me
i was at the time at my friends house my mom and grandma took me home in the evening and we went to the hospital the day after
i am so hurt i am so mad i feel like i came along when she was at her lowest when she needed someone
it really really sucks when the most pain is coming from how i am and my pain is rooted to me existing and thinking
i feel like a fraud and that my boss who hired me will realise he made a mistake and regret it
it screenshot right where she is standing in front of her new boyfriend the thing is we broke up like 3 years ago
i do not know if i believe you when you say you deleted those i tried so hard to help you transition
this is my first real breakup and i do not know what to do with myselfi get it a lot of people who hurt get dumped
only my family members have wished me a happy birthday so far i might facetime with my friend today but idk
i will not give all the details but i came to realise this year how emotionally unavailable i have been over the years
times are hard enough with what is happening in the usa and world living with her is basically going to tear my marriage apart
it is not about which is better being with them in person or on a webinar but making the most of my circumstance and adapting
he has experienced a lot of loss in his life from what he has told me he has also attempted suicide a couple years prior but he says he no longer wants to commit suicide
i do not want lose my best friend but i feel like it would be selfish of me to say hold on to what we have they said that i am the main reason they have not done anything but also expressed that they do not want to go on living for others anymore again given their circumstances and everything they have been through i completely understand why they feel that way
who knows maybe someday i will i hope it will not be too late by then it just crossed my limits
married couples are the luckiest people alive my ex has already given all of those things to someone else except her body
the ex said he was not leaving until he talked to her and i started just beating the crap out of him
i think i did not take enough aspirin i did not have more in my house and i was too lethargic to cut further
i do not go to therapy as i have not tell anybody except my brother who think that i said i want to die as a joke
somehow we were unstoppable but now we just exist in a world that is not us i know you care at least i believe you do after seven years
i even have the urge to pull the pain out of my head too just like v wants to at one point though there is a biochip in that spot in the game
fuck you you do not deserve to live you are a waste of space and money any 20 year old sane person would have passed his professional exams by now but you already failed twice look at your friends and look at you you loser no wonder people make fun of you go fuck yourself
it is annoying it is come to a point where i m not realising that i m actually doing it if anyone experience this please tell me what to do i want to stop this
i really enjoy making creative stuff but i do not feel like making it for myself plus situation in my home is not good
my family and i have also noticed her sitting on the couch or something and just staring into space for long periods of time
i tried to teach you about your hair and how to take care of it i tried to teach you how bra sizes work and why showering every day is important
what is infidelity is it only physical cheating or its mental and emotional too is it your partner keeping secrets from you and doing the stuff you do not expect them to do
my parents played an elaborate prank i was woken up to a small bangpopping sound forever lonely putting on a mask to prevent people from coming in its not like i am never happy
i made it i got into internship succeeded massively got hired on contract after a month of insane and awesome i liked it grind got a raise after 23 months and continued to do well until i did not of course which was about 2 years after i started working commercially
yes she said that to me 24 hours before dumping me and burning me to the groundjust like the kiss of death she gave me our sweet signature and then knockedmeout
all he ever gave me were empty promises that he was going to go to therapy to get help but he never did
i wish i could i would taken her to school with me sometimes i feel full of life and love fulfilled yet never fully happy but pretty close
sharing head phones listening to that funny podcast instead of listening to the guest lecture then you asked me to go to the movies

there was cheating on one side but only after she had tried and tried to get me out of my depression and withdrawal from her and the family
now every time i talk to a guy i get so scared that this happen again or that the guy i would date would never love me back as non of the guys i dated did
my grandpa asked my dad what was going on and he did not want my father to yell at my uncle to let me enjoy christmas he was afraid my grandma would have a heart attack because she was thrilled that my uncle was there
why do we have to get diagnosed to start transitioning i would rather take my own fucking life then continue living as a parasite in my own body
i still think about how you would twitch in your sleep and wake yourself up i would laugh everytimeso it is somehow been 6 months since he asked me to stay somewhere else and we broke up
i talked to my friend about something i have been talk about but then i guess they got tired of it and just became so condescending
when asked hey how is the gf going i usually got flustered and embarassed because i would not say things are great love her right of the bat i was starting to get more and more bored in activities that we loved to do together
i have got many brothers and sisters spilt parents 3b 3s and as a child i was always apprently very physically abusive i do not deny this but as a child i did not feel anything was wrong to my brother as they have mentioned it to me and i feel terrible and terrified that i was even capable it is actually heartbreaking
so i already know you are going to think about the situation but let me tell you how to think about it
i can not be chill around them i can be myself around everyone else in my life but i always feel on edge around them like they project an negative image on to me or are critical of my every move
we got engaged about a year in a half ago things were great the first year but after that the constant bickering started
i am exhausted i have ruined my twenties and i can not see this getting any better then texts me back saying you even had to call me you are blocked do not expect a handout
alcohol helps but it is not a habit i can afford since i got fired fuckkk idk why i am posting this
so i make the choice to shut everyone else out in my eyes loneliness by choice is much better to manage
the first time i cut myself on purpose it was on my face for a few months after that i was kind of embarrassed to show my face to other people but i did not really leave my house that much so it was whatever ik but now i like my facial scars and kind of want to do it again as cut myself i can feel all my pentup emotions and frustrations come out
but i am wondering does anyone know any songs about breaking up but still caring for the person wishing them a good future focusing on yourself but also keeping the happy memories that you shared
is it ok to indulge in it for a while i want to so much and have been watching game streams a lot but i keep thinking it is not right to do so but i can not stop myself
wow so i am writing this as if i was talking out loud we were talking for 8 months he broke me up 2 months ago when we met in person
i was a bully victim not a normal bully victim i am going to get a shit ton of hate for this in the first year i was the only white kid in year 7 so i was already an outsider in their eyes mentally beaten before the actual beatings began
i was so depressed i almost ended my life over it so any advice would be much appreciatedi do not even know why i am posting here i do not see how my life can change

i am 23 and everything is hopeless and i am completely alone now i have no family or friends only my wife not to discredit my wife
hi i am writing because i feel alone because i have came to a conclusion that my real life friend of 78 years and that is from freshman year to now has just dropped me like a bad habit for internet friends
not some perfect person who is going to tell me what i need to do as if i do not already know that i should keep a routine set goals for myself journal etc
if a car mechanic happens to be subpar it is not the end of the world well if you come with a very expensive car it is a bigger deal then you would not want to go to any mechanic or even an okay mechanic they could fuck it up and then what and what if it is your very own mind and thinking processes
i have several friends who have told me many times i can talk about anything and likewise for them to me but still it is just easier said than done for me
forgive my rambling i have got nobody to talk toi broke up with my boyfriend about four weeks agonow i do not have much of a stockpile of pills anymore at least not anything useful
again i do not blame her i am amazed by her she was and is so strong i get cold today so that i do not have the energy to write good sentence
guess she did not like me after all i do not know i would prefer to just be told hey not interested anymore because of this reason
they do not need me they have assured me of that but here is the dilemma my extended family does not get along with my mum
what i wanted to get across with that post was that i have been starved for interaction with others for years and have not fully realized it until recently yet as the title states i despise interacting with others i pretty much always have
i told her about my porn addiction early on in the relationship i relapsed around 5 months into our relationship and struggled with it even til this day
i do not know what is wrong with me why i cry after a day spent with my family having fun and being otherwise happy i do not know why the smallest things and inconveniences makes me burst into tears i do not know why i tend to think of suicide at the end of a good day
the lonely feeling is killing me inside and i feel like a burden to everybody around me i believe in you we can do it baby steps
i wanted to write a long and motivational post to help those who are stuck but to those passively moving along as i did i beg you to work on yourself and try to be the best version of yourself
i have been trying that stuff for ten years now trying to make online friends and it never works this means that by this point next year i will have nobody in my life and i guess i just do not really know how i am meant to deal with that
he said he had tried to make the day a good one i told him he did and i did not understand why he thought i was unhappy
but what is the whole point of this i have been trying to avoid her as of recent a lot more without confronting her why since i know how she can be and the last thing i want to see or hear is her crying
i still would jump in the minute you are in distress and if you need someone to talk to i will always be there but i am probably not the person anymore with whom you would talk about her sorrows that is her
and it is made me lack so much empathy for people here when they have problems and i do not think that is fair
do you guys have any idea what can i do or what do you guys do when you feel like this
would constantly tell me that i am the one bringing in drama when in reality he could not own up to the mistakes he is made and try working things through together in his eyes he was always right
i know most people are sadlonely this holiday season but i am the opposite i still love her and she wants to be friends but i do not know if i can do that
cheating or anything like that so if we look at the definition of the word hurt which is another common thing
then i got a temp job in georgia which demanded so many hours of me and we got in an argument because i did not make time to call or facetime him
if we only have one life as the saying goes i would rather be anything else i do in some ways think life is beautiful
i have had depression for the last few years now no big deal having all the joy in anything slowly be sucked away is surprisingly tolerable but at this point i think i have been basically in dark souls terms hollowed out
physically i am losing hair it is slow but irreversible and now it is getting harder for me to comfortably hide it for a female it is devastating to say the least it is like losing a part of you slowly and i can do nothing but constantly go through the stages of grief every time i look in the mirror i hate myself even more
these past few weeks have been really difficult we have been on and off for the entirety of our relationship but this time is different
my wife called an ambulance i was taken to a hospital they ran some tests and decided to transfer me to another hospital
now it is 2018 i am in law school and i was doing pretty good i was liking it things in the relationship were ok but in august all went bad really bad
this was my friends response to me telling him i want to die i do not hate him but i am so tired of hearing this
i have a problem i have never had a relationship before and i honestly feel ashamed by it i am 22 years old
i have gf that it is bi and that is killing me everytime i see lesbian i just imagine her doing it or thinking about girls and i just fucking feel so bad that i want to just cut my throat and not feeling anything anymore
never had a girlfriend or even that close of a friend had a really bad and abusive childhood the world is not that black and white
there are so many ways in which life really sucks for me at the moment and i really got to help myself but feel stuck
he asked me to go and see him the next day and stay round said he just wanted his girlfriend with him
great at listening and giving good advice but bad at giving said good advice to himself it gets me questioning my identity and sense of value because my selfesteem has deteriorated so much
i felt like we were focused on both of us at least in my mind we were she said she just wants to be alone that she does not have plans of dating for now
the entire time i was thinking that it was a terrible idea and hes not going to take me back hes just doing it because hes a guy
wondering and hoping the knife beside me would actually i scare myself because i know i am different from everyone i know
then on my 5th grade i changed to a new school and the same happened i was friends with everyone and could hang out with anyone but i did not feel anything besides a casual friendship and i would still come home to tell my parents i have no friends
he was not afraid to tell me how much he liked me from the get go which was so foreign to me
i do not want him to feel anguish i want him to move on and be happy because that is what he deserves
the kindness compassion i have witnessed on reddit kept me going through horrors of evil i witnessed this year because reddit proves on the daily that there are more good people than bad in this world and that is worth living for
i broke down and started sobbing while i said i do not want this to make dad not talk to me again
he was a bully a racist and i was ok with it please reddit give me some last ounces of hope
i can not forgive myself the thought alone makes me feel extremely selfish and toxic i just hurt myself when i feel negative until i stop feeling that way
hey there i just started up a little thing of my own where i vent about my life and post poetry and art others are welcome to join its rthemisfitinsomniac
i thought when i got older and maybe my brain develops more fully anxiety would get better but no it has gotten worse nearly midway though my 20s and my anxiety is just getting worse i do not think i am serious about suicide but maybe if i go through more and more panic attacks maybe i would do it irrationally
until she finally broke and ended it she had issues of her own that i knew but still prioritized my feelings whenever i act up
first off please forgive any grammar mistakes below english is not my native language and this is my first reddit post so i beg everyone to please be nice to me
many folks are not willing to work on themselves but i know when i have been not caring to her i have honestly felt like i try to make strides in being appreciative of her every day
i made a lot of mistakes with old friends so i am also afraid to try making new ones because i do not want to mess up again
i waited for a few days for the feelings to pass as i was not really sure where they had came from
when would i want to wake up i have nothing to look forward in my life our relationship was already shaky even before btw
but i tried to be just a little normal because just the illusion of having her as a girlfriend maybe having that dream that i am trying to delete from my mind of having a family
like a dog i believed her each time i who have been reduced as just someone she shares a roof with
although i am taking the initiative to change my situation i have not had any luck at all finding a job today i had a crying fit again
i have been suicidal since i was 10 for various reasons i am now almost 21 now just today he just blocked me on social media now i feel really really alone
but it was too little too late i did start playing chess and drawing in first grade i was smart but made reckless mistakes
i am a single 40 yr old man and i have been living with loneliness for so long but i never seem to get used to it
she said that it was just a joke and that she actually was not going to post anything sexual on that story
i cut myself first in my 8th grade and only my dad knows about iti can not stand this loneliness anymore if i can not sort this situation i will get depression
i am so sad that humans occupy this amazing beautiful earth yet focus so much on money which we created i mean it literally costs so much money just to survive it is seriously depressing
what is wrong with me i feel like i have no interest in anything for example every job does not seem to excite me the thought of living exhausts me i have such negative beliefs about myself and my abilities
a little background for reference so i finally had the strength to go no contact with him i initiated it after he told me he was already talking to someone new it was so hard but felt like the right thing to do for myself
i get that bad news sells but to not see one good act of human decency in monthes is depressing
i would rather have a friend mad at me than dead she told me she is suicidal and she is so opposed to getting help from our school she thinks a therapist would be dismissive and would just prescribe pills i ended up telling my teacher and now i know i am going to get a text that says you told the teacher i trusted you and told you how uncomfortable i am sharing this kind of information
despite that he is not much of a talker or a feelings type of personi always see people from my school posting about their depressions
once you have been legitimately violated once you lose the ability to give a shit who you give your body to afterwards
i still want to be friends too but i get that that can be hard on a lot of people to especially since he probably thinks that i am still in love with him when i am not
when would i want to wake up i have nothing to look forward in my life i feel like there is no point in my existence it is not like i can change the world
this child has been forbidden to speak publicly for 4 years his father is the mosthated man in america and his mothers porn career will forever be more memorable than her stint as flotus he has had to internalize a lot of negativity and now he will be thrust into a very real harsh world
it was really hard to adapt to a new environment especially being such an introvert i was not always welcomed because i did not fit in
sorry i am not good at this stuff but i am more or less alone on christmas my business is close to bankruptcy i have been in therapy for depression for months now i have done all i could for my family this year and i earned their resent for it because it was not enough
i did well in school and tried my best to care for others even though i knew that they would never do the same i am not sure what i am doing wrong as a human being just that it would be better if i left the earth i do not want to feel pain anymore or the pain of rejection my fingers are shaking as i type this
friends only seem to want to communicate on a screen nowadays and sadly i actually need to speak to someone i am finding my days last forever especially in this current situation i find watching tv or films or whatever is not very interesting to me any more
she said to give her a year i know that is a short time for stuff like that but i will ask in a year
i still feel incredibly guilty about calling the police though which i should so i stay at the hotel the whole time and utilize the hotel amenities
i am thinking a lot about that that i want to message my exgirlfriend only just to feel like that somebody cares about me or just simply interested in my thoughts opinions and so on but i do not want to stop noncontact because she is the one who ended our relationship
pain is predominantly right side under the shoulder blade pain is excruciating pain affects my mental health it stunts my growth as a person
my mum and siblings all have families and partners and i am single and alone i do not know what more to say except i feel sad
he is not being malicious or anything just expressing something he liked which he is giving a try for the first time and socialising even if its online
but then again i think about the other woman the time i deeply fell in love whose boyfriend committed suicide and i am full of fears and i see people trying to get attention abusing those who feel love and it makes me feel like puking it is horrible it is a nightmare inside a nightmare
the same day l was back home he was already on tinder meeting new girls in my country which she always wanted to try and stay in kentucky
i would just like to point out here that we never did anything we should not have done never even kissed my sister checks like literally all symptoms and she is in therapy for about 6 months or so
my girlfriend did not want to make her friend send screenshots of everyone since that would fill up her friends camera roll and they would have a bunch of men in their conversation
i am sorry that this is long or if its not formatted well i just need someone to tell me what to do i guess so this is kind of half a vent and half asking for advice what should i do
these pots are put together again to show us that nothing is ever truly broken and it is more beautiful afterwards
i do not think he did it to save me some pride bc the things he had said to me still haunts me to this day
it is so hard to keep going when i feel like i am taking two steps back as i step forward with age
i could never get the space i needed to recover from each fight and she would frequently try to initiate sex to make things better
i told her the scenario and we somehow agreed to include him to our trip so we can all unwind i know this is stupid decision of mine she suddenly asked me to drop her at home bec she is not feeling well and just want to rest
she is moved in with her friends so she is probably having an easy meanwhile i am stuck in an empty apartment working a job i resent no friends or family here and i want to go home but i can not because covid
they are constantly having a conversation with each other to convince you to do certain actions and delegate with emotions to persuade you the ultimate will to commit an action or be in a certain state of mind by drowning out the mental warfare inside your head you will be able to silence both of these voices to gain control and tell them to shut it
these empty feelings come out especially during the holidays when i compare my christmas to the one of my bf and acquaintances i am so scared of falling back into my past self destructive habits but the temptation is strong i need to find a job and move out or else i do not know what i will do
so when my experience with friends is like this i kind of lose hope about ever kind of curing myself if you will from loneliness because even if i make new friends or get reacquainted with old ones once again i know that i will never be able to openup to them about some emotional issues knowing the fact that i am only handing them ammunition for them to use on me if we ever have a falling out or just in an argument
wanted to be there to tell me it is going to be okay and that the hope is right around the corner
i know i am not completely over my ex he took them among a vast amount of other things he also left a scary note behind
i think the main issue is that he needs to work on himself he can not let himself open up and let me in because he is too scared
not just any random person if some random person started talking about their ex it would not really bother me every day i feel the same and i apply everything learned i feel weight on my shoulders
15f i have been diagnosed with anxiety depression ocd and addthis first happened in october and the scene does not seem to improve for another 6 months
now that you all have the background here is what is got me anxious right nowi have a few issues but i will try and list the most prominent ones
many people have it but they may not notice when you have depression you can feel hopeless or suicidal even but the worst thing is when you feel alone
first off i know i need therapy i do i just prefer working on myself by myself first i am so tired
you could go back and forth about what each method means but guns are easy power i have always thought that is the reason guys do it with guns more often than girls do is that powerlessness is a feeling they feel more often more emasculating more suicide worthy
i have no friends and believe me i really tried my best i try to spark conversations about similar interests but it never works
zits not like i do not want to do it i just can not my head is on crooked and i can not seem to think straight
bad hair genetics bad case of kp overweight i have always felt that because i do not have the type of body i am attracted to that i myself am unattractive
he said i was complaining too much and i have unrealistic expectations and i do not understand him at all because if i did then i would not expect an apology and i would know that this was something that he did not mean
it was a tough journey and i really did not think i would get better but my bf stayed by me took care of me and encouraged me throughout it all
a healthy relationship turned one sided then toxic abused me and used me for the things you swore you would not while you broke the highest level of respect i had for you not just that you broke a pinky promise
i have not felt like my myself in a few years now but i have been getting terrified by my mind as of recent
bc i know i can be fun and outgoing and loving and happy for the most part but i am so broken i feel i am suffocating at times
soon they were spending all their time together over the years eventuallythings got bad enough where she needed a nursing home
maybe some of you have some nice tips for my or have experienced a similar situation thank you for reading all the way towards here i really appreciate it
but i like the current version of me more focused more heartless and realizing that there is more to life than having a romantic interest
its not like i feel different than the rest of 17 year olds tbh i have a good circle of friends around me who care about me and i care about them
i have nothing to stay here for so this is my final goodbye she was the only one for me and will forever be
like i am worthless of his love and that he is better off without meand that is the other thing that bothers me about what i have read
now it is like i do not exist he will not respond to texts but views my story within minutes of me posting it
i have spoken to the only 2 hometown friends i have and the conversations just do not flow the same i am done with uni now and i had to send people messages about how much i would miss them they did not keep the conversation up or say they would miss me
laughed at start almost stopped an car at the middle of the roadand no jokes i still was looking at theis like to hallucinations but the driver stopped on next crossroad
you loved me so much you convinced me to risk my naked body to youlast night was one of the most vivid dreams yet
goodnight everyone i pray that everyone seeking help finds solace its just too late for mer k s q i will always love you all
i should note that while i may not be depressed the thoughts however completely out of place feel completely normal almost too normal
i sit and wonder while i smoke and contemplate on doing another line why am i depriving myself of human interaction
i ask her why can not she be with me n pursue at the same time she said its takes too much effort and she want to see how it goes without commitment
i really do not know what i should make of my life from here on anyone got ideas on what i should do
i got engaged planned a wedding was assaulted and everything ended in just a few short months4the thing that tops the cake suicide issues tried to kill myself about 4 times
we were perfect at least i thought so 50 to 100 days later i remain broken and crushed if i am being honest i hope she will find this post and read it and call but i do not think that is going to happen
all i do is sleep the whole day and dream about a better lifei feel pathetic and lost at the same time
had to move home because of the pandemic though i have a job its my first i cannot really go back right now
the problem is how can i move on when i still have hope he will come back my heart is destroyed
he was outdoor with his ap and our kids in morning later he did not came home for kids to sleep they were with his parents
if it was all we needed forever we would be together i am so angry at you for not being someone i could rely on i am so sad that you are too sad to change anything about your life and i am sorry that i was too tired and broken to keep trying
i really wish i joined the military after hs it could have instilled values and lifeskills in me that i sorely needed
the day she left i thanked her for coming to visit me and felt excited about the new journey we were about to take
please comment on what you guys do in your lives in these times i am curious i 18f have not had a long lasting friendship for 6 years now
it just feels like i am alone in this like when i am with people i do talk and laugh but deep inside i am lonely i do not have any constants i do not get any messages it is always me reaching out to them
i was always hesitant about getting on any psych med because i just do not like the idea that my brain is a chemical machine always maintaining some delicate balance which if altered can have serious or even fatal consequences
i am also thinking of moving to another city and start over after the virus ends of course but i am not sure if this would help i would hate to waste so much effort just to end up back at the same place
i often imagine what i look like to other people and try and view myself through their eyes using my imagination because i am so scared about what i look like
he is the complete opposite of me work wise he gets dirty at work everyday and works with his hands he is an extremely hard worker and can fix just about anything
that was stressful for us financially and it drew a slight wedge between us because i finally had something to do with my time again and he mostly waited for me to come home
i literally just feel like ending it all right nowi think soon will be time where it will happen and that he was seeing someone else
it is simple whenever you find yourself beating yourself up mentally or engaging in any form of negative self talk replace the sentences with a more realistic version
this is my fault and all i have been doing is thinking thinking about my faults and what i need to do to change so that i can be better for you
she is constantly manipulating me and blaming me for everything wrong she once called me a selfish brat for cutting myself and she frequently mocked me for it
i am not old enough to drink and i can not do anything outside the house due to virusthis is the first year where i have been completely by myself on both thanksgiving and christmas
i was exhausted but after paying the normal bills i would put money away so that i could afford to buy her a ring
i know that getting a diagnosis can be quite difficult in some cases eg due to financial reasons and that selfdiagnosing may be helpful to gain some orientation in the mess of our minds
our family did not know he had bet so much money in it my brother thought he could rely on family to do something else if he could not succeed in his exams
i am not a bad person that i want to break up with you i did not have the courage to leave you
i write letters to my ex fiancee a ghost wondering this world without a purpose alone and lonely without any real companions
i recently created a blog site in which i write various articles on how to become confident why you should not seek happiness how to build relationships with others and so on
so halfway through our game night he joined the call and i heard his voice for the first time in nearly 2 weeks
2 weeks ago i was viewing this subreddit to see what kind of loneliness people were dealing with and more so the specific reasonings that may be associated with loneliness
i can not focus at my jobwhich is a whole nother issue in and of itself because i feel incompetent and like i do not deserve to be in the position that i am in
i have my husbands familys birthdays in my phone calendar so i never forget to send them a text all the inlaws and their adult children i am no longer on facebook 2 years now my birthday was last week and only 2 people out of 20 texted me happy birthday
when the time came for me to choose a career i wanted to study architecture i prepared for the entrance exams of architecture alone
my bedroom feels like it is not meant for just me anymore and i have just been crying and generally acting like a child about the whole thing but it is really upsetting to me
i would believe her if she did not leave me on read and block my viewing of her ig stories she said she did this because she did not want me to know if she was online and would not awnser any of my questions
i feel like i have not even completed one 1 developmental stage yet dissociating most of the time idk where i truly am
no one asked how i was doing no one really cared i have got great parents but it is impossible to talk with them because we are so different
it devastated me she said we are at 2 different points in our life she can not heal while she is with me and that she thinks i wanted something more homely than what she could give me for a few years i was willing to move cities or wait 3 years for her
i know i am probably being controlling in not wanting ppl to be his friend but why does everyone care so much more about him when he is been so horrible to me
but as i have told you and also personally realized that it is an unreal scale to judge myself or my so called friends
he is been hanging out and flirting with another girl and at this point i feel heartbroken my feelings are hurt and i am jealous
do not ever pay someone so that they can be friends with you in 10th gradebut due to some family issues we could not be together

bitter taste in my throat deadly poison in my veins counting the seconds till i get insanethese walls getting closer these lights getting darker want to get outta here but the exit is closed forever
and with globalisation more of us than ever before are moving vast distances for new jobs further education and even for love leaving our social nets behind
why can not i hate her get over her even though i have been told that regardless of how many great things that there were between us the bad she is done should out weight those it does not feel that way
most of this is my fault because after the breakup we went to bed again and we were becoming close again but then i had her sex with her friend
every person i have fallen in love with has taken advantage of me or left me in some wayi think we will be talking tomorrow more but to be honest i am just very sad
i kept putting off asking her to be my gf although we were exclusives since early and i felt i got kind of rushed into it by may 2019 red flag i took 9 months to go from dating to gfbf
but everytime i go to eat halfway in i get sick to my stomach and can not even look at the food
i kind of had to start taking medication for all the panic attacks that i started to have but then i slowly was getting okay and i really thought i made progress
does this make me a bad personso i broke up with my girlfriend of a year just over 6 weeks ago let us call her kate
so he messaged a friend of mine yesterday night saying he was going to kll himself and i called him he did not pick up at first but called me back 10 minutes later
again i wanted to do the work and we were ok for a moment but not the same he gradually became distant and made some onlyfans content with his ex while wearing a bracelet i got him which tells me what he really thought of me he says he is sorry that he hurt me but not that he made the content and the last 24hrs i have been blowing up his phone asking if you were having doubts why did not you tell me which he never answered it all came to an end today and we have blocked each other everywhere
however in my reply to him mentioned that i was also planning on doing the same through my upcoming university semester essentially feeling like i had oneupped him
i know i have it under control just enough to hang in there for a while but i am terrified bc i feel like the outcome i want but wish i could overcome is inevitable
sometimes i get really irritated by certain things but after the tense situation lightens up i almost immediately change and apologize for my irritated and often rude response to normal human behavior from other people
it is a struggle to move anymore to eat to do anything i have already tried to end it twice nobody knows that
that is the only part of my plan that i am incredibly uneducated about all sorts of stuff now it is like i do not exist
going on dates with new people helps today i did not like the girlbut one day i will and then the thoughts will stop
challenges and obstacles are a part of life they make us stronger and build character if life were easy it would be boring and you would never grow
then i would return to my cycle of doubt and sorrow i feel like part of my purpose is just gone it was brighter with him here
she told me not to worry and i wanted to trust her no matter what like we promised to each other
there was a time here where things almost seemed to be done and dusted because if for any chance the planned move to abroad failed to happen she could not see herself be stuck with me in a city she did not like
this past week i wake up everyday wishing i was dead the pain is not unbearable i know things will get better but here is the thing
so i tried to be supportive and be involved i would ask how it was going offered to read scripture with her etc
i try to sleep but i get nightmares and wake up in the middle of the night this is the worst feeling in the world
there is just this void in me that is been there for a while and i just hate it i mean i have gotten use to it
it could be moments it could events it could be places they treated you badly it is so unusual that when you break up your mind tries to remindyou of all the good times
she cried out the pain and has moved on from me whilst i am stuck with the dark cloud that follows me of missing her and i can not get rid of it
what happened please do not look if you can not handle description of suicide one night i was playing minecraft with my boyfriend
i would love to speak with a therapist but my insurance is more localized to the other part of the state
despite all this and a lot of resulting pitfalls and delays i have managed to get educated and get a career i have my own place and all the usual stuff to keep in it i am not in need that way
and the worst part is he did not end it ever he always prompted me to but he did not do it himself
the worlds so fucking self obsessed and they call it self love my job was eliminated i was given the option of going to cap 1 or cap 2
i cracked the hinge on my new workcovered laptop and broke it because i am not a hardware repair technician and do not know what i am doing and should not be attempting this
when she thinks she is ready for a realationship i will bring up what happened yesterday and say that maybe we should give it another go but until then i will try my best to not break down in front of her
sorry if there are any grammatical errors or something but i am still kind of drunk and i honestly make so sense right now
i am glad he was strong for himself like i was not but it kind of stings that he just pushed away so fast
something else happened in 2018 that caused my paranoia which i am not willing to share as i know reddit is pull of judgmental people which has restrained me from going on further
i honestly do not think he realised how much he actually hurt me yet i still want him back and would give anything to be with him again
i am actually sick i have cried to my mom and boyfriend about it and i know i can talk to them
whoever thought that i could write this all down i was capable of it tonight and i am proud of myself
i wanted to take my life yesterday but my girlfriend convinced me to stay i can not stop thinking about it though
i have been leaving him alone i have had trouble sleeping stressing about where i am going to move to when i get back home how my stuff is going to ship and how much things are going to cost and if i have the money
i was to swim in the ocean climb mountains grow a garden learn to cook watch animals in the wild learn different languages
so what other reasons for him to redownload the app so many time he had issues getting his last paycheck and that put him under stress
true love is when you help your partner in everything but not because you want to have a sense that you are a better person but because you actually want to help them and feel so happy when you help them have a better life because this life is also shared by you
2019 i changed jobs and worked in an office which seemed to make me more anxious and stressed distracting me from the more intense feelings of loneliness however i definitely still had breakdowns and shitty times
why does not it hurry up with me i have very little to leave behind and no one here to claim my body
the anger will just be gone as soon as i hurt myself to the point where i die i want to die so badly that i do not see a future where i am not 6 feet under
everyday i wonder how people look at my loneliness it feels like i am aloneone thing i wonder is if i should send my ex a message
and i fucked it up just like i do with everythingwe broke up right before the holidays started i know it will get better but it is so hard to think like that
i walk away knowing i give my all to her and my best i can walk away with my head held high knowing i never cheated when i had plenty of chances
he said that he did it again because he was desperate he was too depressed and could not handle a long distance relationship without physical contact
i plan to take 20 x 500mg of regular paracetamol and 12 x 665mg of extended release paracetamol so hopefully just under 18g is enough
today he asked me to please stop talking to him at all i feel lost and stranded and stuck and i have never been sadder
those of you who had similar issues do you feel it is possible to change in a year what is your perspective like thanks

i can not stop comparing myself to his new girlfriend and my mental health has gotten incredibly worse because of the break up

we are doing no contact and it is harder than i ever thought but is it hard for you i am not sure i will ever know
this past weekend she was going to hangout with some friends and i suddenly got anxious thinking that a person that she is had feelings for in the past may show up and i questioned her
i think that is the way to now look at it from this perspective i am breaking my golden chains and i understand the painful journey behind it no one said it is easy it is just that i have to get back to normal
got into this kind of play where i am this persona who is looking emotionally stable to not worry anyone but inside i am screaming
i did not have to suffer going into college the thought of going back makes me want to cry i have also never had anything remotely close to a relationship to this day
you will feel a lot better i know its tough to give up on someone but do prefer yourself your mental health and your parents

moreover i started several hobbies just to do something other than my job after some years i can say i do them just to distract myself from my current condition
and honestly i am fairly annoyed that i am letting the holidays get to me i have not ever been much of a celebrator but my first christmas alone its already completely miserable
no job or school can not stand to be seen or even look at myself in the mirror i do not use the communal bathroom in my quad i just piss in my sink

and the entitlement i have to say i do not ever feel entitled to friendship or love these things are not necessary for survival in the same way food and shelter are
my wife had cushings disease one affliction is great anger and great depression hers is centered around food when she is hungry nothing sounds good so that makes her angry
so this is not really about me more about a friend of mines the voice that whines and cries out for attention
1st breakup she saw old photos of my ex on facebook that i forgot to delete she reaches out and apologize after 3 days
they smile laugh at your jokes for a while hahahahhahaaaaaaaatheir laugh made you fall in love all over again i know it is hitting you now
i last heard from her about 5 months ago while we were together and she was cheating with him she got pregnant
i want to be weak the reward in what constitutes being strong is not worth it i do not want the spotlight i want to chase my happiness people praising me does not give me happiness in fact it makes me feel angry angry the fact that they were not there when i have been through many holes before
but just like today he came over and he uses messenger i asked him what he was doing for his birthday
i do not even bring this crap up it just gets thrown at me for opening my mouth i can barely get out of bed to go to work when is all of this going to end
i love them a lot but i just do not feel like we are not right for eachother and i do not know what do do anymore

every time after it was better and we hoped that they might seek help if they realise how much it helped them and us
talking to family is out of the option also fucking dysfunctional and i do not want to go back there to an unsupportive family especially in the state i am in i do not have anyone to talk to about this tried therapy it did not work
i start to get stuck in my depression now to where my life betters girls where all over me and i am not going to lie i had fun
i can not stop thinking that he may be going through a lot of depression underneath as this is a huge turn he met this girl literally a month ago and she has been introduced to friends already
started to listen to let us plays just so i could hear voiceshave not really spoken to anyone this week so i am making this to make me somewhat happier
when i first posted here i did not give much context at least in the post i made here back in october some fuckers broke into my car and stole tools issued to me by work
i keep having to play music on my earphones over it and it means i do not sleep because i am too scared to turn it off
i posted about a particularly strange interaction i had a few months ago at a bike meetup here on the rlonelyhttpswww
i will feel fine for a few days then have a huge breakdown about it four years later in high school my behavior changed radically for the better
i am an 18yearold male in my senior year of high school i have always struggled with anxiety and obsession especially when i was younger
we were walking down the streets i was ugly crying the whole time she was speaking about her current life unemployed depressed no ambitions living with a boyfriend who she does not like too much but who makes her feel safe
well pretty much 2 days in she starts ghosting and i come to find out she was staying at a friends house when an ex came by
she texted me the next day saying she loves hanging out and wants to keep being friends regardless of him which i gave a short response to
my ex came back and apologized and was there for me emotionally he talked to me several times a day and even visited me
this year will be five years since my first love left me and cut all contact with me never was i the same again i think of him every day i still love him
i become very jealous and he hates me for that i now know it is not that i did not trust him it was because i was struggling with trusting myself
i have not texted her because i still deeply care for her and know this type of relationship is only hurting me because i am secretly hoping we get back together
we both showed how much we loved each other cared for each other and i was really really sure that nothing could separate us and we already had talked and planned everything for our life and our little family in the future
and we both made mistakes and we both hurt each other but i can not stand the fact that my attention was not good enough
he was the last of my friends i still talk to since the rest of them stopped talking to me over a period of years in a similar way as him though
a part of me wants to prove her wrong and seduce her back but another part wants to just move on
i am afraid of my inner critic will come out and i will struggle to give the empathy connection and support that it takes to be a good friend
but instead of running away from you and doing what was best for me i decided to fight for us and try to make things work
post what you posted before and most likely they will come across it seeing you thriving walking away with grace with no motive to fuck stuff up is the best revenge
so i am wondering if this is valid and if it is how should i confront him about italso the article i read about symptom of paranoid schizophrenia is from herehttpswwwwebmdcomschizophreniaschizophreniaparanoia
i usually lie to my parents i know i should not but i was always scared to tell them how i truly feel about everything and anything
i have spoken with the police no less than four times in relation to this i just want this shit over and i do not want to be around anymore idk what to do anymore
i feel like a drone dragging myself through each and every single day with her etched into my mind i just want to smile laugh feel happy again
we lived together for 15 of the 20 months we were together and it really made things difficult but i had some personal issues and i kind of emotionally withdrew
my first serious relationship encouraged me to make some of the best mistakes i have ever made to keep you happy to make sure that we stayed together
right now i just want to kill myself every time i feel like i am doing alrightmy brain is like oh let us just fuck it all up again
i blame myself for things that i can not control yet i know it is not my fault i want someone to notice it am i attention seeker
hes defends me like people sometimes just want to beat my face somewhy and after not started talk i feel their fear and they run away
i am pissed there is no opportunities in my town for me to meet people i am pissed that i can not give my love to someone which is all i really want
and through all this i can not help but wonder if we would have made it for the long haul if covid had not broken us
i want to live in a world in which we exist together i want us again but i do not think now is our time
if that does not help imagine you have been awake for a few days you know what you are doing but you are not fully there
i also feel very lonely but i will not share my story just yet i prefer to open up a discussion if possible about loneliness being treated like a mental disorder
i am so scared i do not know just these sensations send me into such a panic i actually start believing that i am developing schizophrenia or dementia or that everything is actually not real there is this constant feeling of dread that does not go away
i am an artistic person and i loved what she brought out of me i think about how you are doing everyday still check my phone for messages that are not there
so i f20 broke up with my ex m20 not even 2 weeks ago we would been together 3 years and i am happier out of the relationship than i was in it he is a great guy but it did not work we have the same basic friend group from high school who we play videogames with now that covid is keeping us all home
yet when i look around nobody cares how i am doing nobody invites me to spend time with them and it feels like the only people wishing me a merry christmas are the ones i matched with on tinder or dating apps who have not sent me one message in months
i turned my back for literally a minute but that is all it took for her and i am extremely scared and sad without her
anyone else slowly lose most contact with friends during this quarantine to give some background i am a rising sophomore in college and i had a pretty challenging time making friends in college
i feel helpless and like i am in a constant battle with myself as i know that i wanted the break up and has good reasons for it but not sure why i feel like this i am never really one to share my emotions with anyones a personality flaw if i say so myself so i really have no one to talk to hence coming to reddit
things just seem really pointless and crap at the moment think we are all somewhat lonely and sad due to covid but it is just shit and sad and everything seems empty and meaningless could defiantly do with some people to talk to so drop me a message so we can temporarily distract each other from crappy life
i hope i can find this again because i am really hurting right now not having anyone to talk to laugh with or just hang out
makes me incredibly anxious and i have been having a lot of problems with anxiety panic attacks anxiety attacks etc lately so i did not want to have to deal with going to her house she told me that she is incredibly upset that i will not come to her house and that she is very hurt and that she did not think i wanted nothing to do with her completely despite me saying that
my question is i want to know how to approach talking about her brothers ocd in a delicate matter no meows
a bit of background on me and my moms relationship i am 14 and have had a really bad relationship with my mom for quite a few years now
i fear the idea of getting buried i fear the thought of my body decaying and slowly decomposing into the soil i fear losing breath or even getting into mildly dangerous situations which others would consider adventure i sort of do not know what to do about it i do not think about this all the time but when i do i end up overthinking and it gets me depressed detached or isolated
we talked and i was getting hurt with every message then with every phone call or was i happy i am not sure anymore
she ended up making that decision and we did not talk again for over 8mo until one day she sent me that i miss you text
hey so i am not the best at admitting to others my problems so why not hide behind a message board basically i am hoping for advice
she was in school while i dropped out because of indecisionthese were all the bad things but the good outweighed the bad
not only is it going to make you feel better about yourself but also help the next person cope up with any struggles they might be going through
in case you want to reach out to make amends or check in you should know i am not the kind of person to ignore you
we had some sort of a break up talk and i found out that it was a very difficult decision for her couse i was her first true love we are kind of young i am 22 and she is 19
do you know anyone who is experiencing apathy were they treated if yes then howi do not know how to cope with my loneliness
once i moved in with him he got a new job as an insurance agent and eventually blamed me because he was not good at his job and was not making enough money
i know i did the right thing i know i do not owe her jack shit i know she has been manipulating me and treating me badly and the right thing to do is end it i know it is not unreasonable for me to end a relationship that feels bad
and the most fucked up part about this i really have no god damn right to be bitching and moaning like this i have two loving parents since i was a kid they work really hard and make enough money not much but enough for me to have a great room great clothes a pc that allows me to play almost all my favorite games food everything
he mentioned the phone call and i said but i did not even answer the call if i wanted to go out i would of and i would of answered the call
i do not understand how to feel anymore because i kind of of hate him for the stuff he is done and said and how he is treated me after our break up and towards the end of our relationship but even when we go forever without talking the moment we start talking again it is like electricity it is like we never missed a beat
i do not say this to be mean it is just not someone i would picture her going for if that makes sense
i am just so tired all i do is drink and cry and sh i got a new job recently and while i go and make money that is not keeping my head above water
i went in my room and locked the door but i could still hear her and she said some really hurtfull stuff
i started to work out and eat good but i hurt my arm while lifting which set me back and i am scared it will affect me for the rest of my life
they just suddenly stop maybe the problem is with me but i do not ever do anythingi am desperate to escape this existence but i do not want to hurt anyone
so sorry to who ever reads this loneliness drives people to some desperate actions i guess or the stranger shows up and rapes her she feels guilty or hates herself or it does not help her
yes i agree with you we can take a break from talking then after awhile we can definitely go back to being friends like we was when we first started talking
i tried no contact but the second i deleted him from my phone he began to call every day and i have tried going no contact three different times
i am so sorry to whoever reads this because my cry for help does not deserve to be infectiously spread around like this i have no one to turn to
i just had my first boyfriend the one for real i have dated men in past hoping for a partner but did not work because they were not interested
i have always felt that there was this mental barrier preventing me from truly expressing myself i spent all of high school in absolute isolation because of my fear and bitterness of people
ignore me constantly saying lol its what happens when i am anxious or at a low point i think its a pseudo coping mechanism i am not sure but
i am sure there is more i can say but i just can not right now my brain is shutting down i can not think properly thank you in advance for whoever would like to comment i appreciate it

i have a history of depression but nothing too major things have a been really weird for me my this past week

i am f17 guessing i can use this subreddit to complain and explain the point of life in which i am existing right now

god dammit how is this the best it gets every day is a fresh hell and every moment i teeter between breaking down and shutting down
things do not make us happy permanently sometimes not even momentarilyrational brain sais that things are changing but its going to take a while
but i guess you do not notice all that when you are a kid or maybe he was good when he was a kid
i have been applying for jobs in the hope i can get one and maybe my partner can come back to this country and stay withmove in with me but nothing yet
the relationship between me and my parents is the worst they can not even bare to look at me when we talk

these calls are not very long at all but during these conversations if i bring up the breakup he gets annoyed and wants to change the subject or hang up

i tell myself that i am allowed to think it is cool and fascinating for this reason but my ocd will not let me
i am scared of ghosts the ones that float in my head and sometimes manifest into people i am scared of the voices that scream at me and make cacophonic noise in my head
a few months later something changed after that i had a relief at my stress and everything go well in the rest of the day
i tend to share everything about myself and my life and this is really the only aspect that i have kept hidden from my readers
she said no and that she would never do that to me i just kept blaming myself but i stayed on a path that was best for us and our future
my ex walked out on me after two years this past january and my recovery from that event has been slow but i am finally in a place where i am no longer pained by it
i can not stand to be around him anymore even when he is happygolucky i hate it j and i really hit it off like really hit it off
i 28 have been with this guy 33 for almost 5 years now he helped me raise my daughter 8 and we were engaged until this past weekend when i broke it off
i think about a physical confrontation with god daily i want to fight himher i want to kill godi just want to do something that i want to do again
really define what that means emotional hurt definition is psychological pain mental pain emotional pain is an unpleasant feeling i am nauseous all the time i feel like i can never catch my breath
idk what it is about me i make people laugh i hang around people i put myself out there it feels like nobody wants me
i feel like ever since i started taking this new medication latuda for bipolar depression i have been feeling very lonely especially at night but also during the day i do not have any reason to be lonely i have an amazing wife a great dog and very loving and supportive family can anyone else relate and more importantly what can i do to stop feeling lonely
when i try to focus on anything eg reading playing games drawing even talking to people my head is in constant pain and i feel nauseous like i am going to pass out i constantly wonder if i am dying or if i am sick i seem to only feel this way when i am alone which is pretty much everyday and i feel very disassociated with myself as if nothing around me is real
recently i had a black out originally i thought it was just a trauma response to having been hit by a car several months ago
i know it is hard i know this has put your strength to the test i am sorry i have had people loved by me i am sorry for being a constant problem
and when they get tucked under their emotions the beliefforming process starts their emotions turn into feelings then their feelings in turn transform into thoughts and those thoughts form their beliefs that help them make sense of what they are experiencing
so when i told my friend this and asked him to leave me alone and not write or contact me for a while because i want to be alone for the time being and he just continued bugging me and telling me how a bunch of friend of his have died and that it is what it is and telling me to get the fuck over it
suddenly my phone rang i answered with my headphones without seeing the callers namethey all stand looking at me in fear hands or their mouths like i am answering a death call
suddenly us designing floorplans or mapping our way to youtube stardom was replaced by disillusionment and sadness to not know how they are doing or feeling it feels shit
not sure why i am posting this it is my first post ever on this platform i think i just wanted to say this to someone who does not know who i am
i feel it when i am going to bed every night before i sleep pain is worse at night however pain can occur at any time and does endure a complete day
this is accompanied by a sense of fear and panic and if it is really bad then i will go fully into the hallucinations and sense of unreality and lose it start crying hysterically until my partner finds me and is able to bring me back by touching me or sitting on me lol because feeling something else touching me usually helps
whether it be friends or a significant other i am impossible to date because i always abandon them after a few dates
i do not want to follow my heart and pursue what i love because i love my parents and i want them to love me back
a huge takeaway from all of this is that i needed to practice more selflove i had not been in a relationship for 2
she gave into lust and had an affair she fell in love with a man who does not even spend enough time with her
he just calls her up when he is craving her mouth and body but nothing more than that their honeymoon phase is ending the excitement and joy are wearing off and the fantasy is falling apart
i just want to say that she broke up with me in june and this is the first message i got since then
someone to test my limits i will find someone like that again do not you think at least i hope i do
i am absolutely good for nothing my life is dead already i hardly ever leave to do anything i am a waste of space and energy
and i heard his voice for the first time in nearly 2 weeks and i just said whop and closed all my tabs no explanation
if you somehow read all of this reader then i thank you for your management to listen to my pain and experience my experience life is so fucking hard but it is easier with people who care i love you and i hope we both find ways to love ourselves my mantra through all of this is how i will end it this mantra came from a book called how to survive the loss of a love
i guess i am posting this to organize my thoughts for a counseling tonight and because i can not burden my remaining friends about this i am sorry to anyone who stumbles upon this and dampens their mood
my question is is she doing this to get my attention i feel like she expected me to chase her and when i did not she was not happy
i am so used to never hearing you look so good tonight i want to do you despite all or to always being told you annoyed me i will not do anything tonight week after week that that is the norm for me i feel like everyone elses going to be this way
those few people i meet at school i feel beggining for some reason to ignore me if i do not say hello they will not too
so my girlfriend and i broke up about 2 weeks ago i tried reaching out to her a day afterwards with no luck of course i struggled aloy for a while but recently i came to the conclusion that if i beg her she will not come back and if i sit and sulk i will make things worse
i woke up with tears in my eyes apparently i have been crying in my dream and it reflected on me in real life
then a week after that a family friend who was practically my second dad died of alcoholism then a month ago today my current college coach also died of a heart attack
but eventually i run out of things to distract myself with and the thoughts come back in summary i do not know what to anymore
i get horrible anxiety about opening the door to my bedroom and seeing some deformed creature sitting on my bed waiting for me or being followed down the hall by a different deformed creature that will catch up to me and do something to me
i still want to end it all but i have a feeling of guilt for thinking about taking my life when i know how much it would hurt her
maybe the problem is with me but i do not ever do anything zeroi do not know how i was home alone all day today
he took his things from my room and locked himself i was in such a huge pain i left home went to some friends to stay with
someone does not text me back when i am fully expecting them to and i start saying things like they do not actually like you you know it everyone knows it and with someone i am interested in it is that same thing with more they are just trying to ease away from you because they do not want to be harsh and they are with someone way more interesting than you you are not good enough for them
hi um i do not usually post on reddit but i wanted to make this post because i sometimes get a random feeling of anxiety and feeling nervous and i am not sure how to deal with it apart from sit there and wait for it to disappear
i have always wanted to stream or do some content creating but i was never in the right mind set to do so
but it is not the place of reddit randoms to go about telling me what my problems are especially after i just fucking told them
trying to get help and get back on meds is impossible right now i have no friends no social connections and no one to talk to
edit i do not know how else to describe it but it is consuming me also i have begun getting super frustrated at everything very quickly
you sitting there reading this right now looking at your computer or your phone with a question in your heart and a thousand thoughts running through your head you with the worries and the fears and the passions and the dreams you with the love in your heart already and the pain there too
in the mean time i will try and hold out my mental state deteriorating by talking to my thereipist family and friends which does include her she said we will not stop talking to each other or doing zoom calls with friends
we dated for about 23 months and we got really close like i really like her maybe it was the rosetinted glasses i was seeing her through but i felt like i nearly loved her she felt the same about me
makes me feel invalid by telling his mates that he does not have a girlfriend ghosted me after he said we would still stay friends and keep in touch
my parents only knew like 4 months ago when out of nowhere i broke in tears at lunch they took me to their room away from everyone to see what is going on and tried to help me
i also have a sleep problem which was undiagnosed for a long time which effected and continues to effect to a lesser degree my concentration and memory even my ability to hold a good conversation i am on medication for this as well and it has allowed me to function
i think i need to by into fate that we just were not meant to be together as much as i thought we were
i am so scared i will not find someone great who will choose me it is so hard to find a decent guy let alone one you really really like
what really crushed me was when she said that she herself was tired of finding the right person and would wish she just found someone she fell in love and get done with it
this has been my entire christmas holidays unable to leave the house i started quarrenting before anyone else in my family due to track and trace app
there is nothing more i can do i got pretty pathetic at the end begging you to stay with me and here we are two days later
i have expressed that i want to go on medication my pleads for help are being ignored by the foster care agency that i am with
i loved you a lot and there are so many little tiny aspects of you that make you your own person
i have anxiety so anxiety and panic attacks are not new to me at all and it is much better than it used to be a few years back
a couple of questions and a general desire for advice do monkey branched relationshipsrelationships starting from cheating last i feel so terrible and i can not blame you for what you did at all i am not mad
i just fucking hate life and myself i hate the way i am early july and my other grandma dies too aged 90
she is hurt and confused that her best friend abandoned her her bf being the person who she told cheated on me and then told me because she felt i deserved to know
i know that depression and anxiety is not easy to heal and it takes time and patience but i wonder if it has anything to do with anti birth pills
there are other wills and voices in this conference room and they also create their own dialogue in our minds but let us focus on the main leaders in this hypothetical room
at its worst which was this summer i ended up dropping 30 pounds i was so anxious all the time that i felt like throwing up every time i ate
my grades at school are dropping and it absolutely terrifies me but i am not able to force myself to do anything
sometimes overthinking and worrying so much to the point where it takes up my entire day and my head feels like it will explode i will throw up
i just wanted to understand what i did so bad and she dugg into me meanlyi said what did i do to deserve this
i would still answer anyway if they asked for help because their questions for help are basically the only conversations i get every day
i felt that if we got a dog and could handle him and show him love and care that it would be foundation for setting up a better relationship with her son
over my teenage years she is constantly let me down emotionally manipulated me and just generally been a shitty person when she cares enough to acknowledge me
you knew my breakdowns and you left me when i was down i can not be mad we must sit in it all
for some reason i keep expecting it to be easy and to find someone new as easily as my ex did
my ex and i just had an pretty rough breakup to start she went on a week long vacation back to her hometown
and i give you advice never use cns stimulators if you are not ready for this game some people just piss in pants first time smoking with me lol i do not even know its cos they fill like i control them or they just see upside of me kind of something trully strange lol
on one hand i know i am the source of my own problems i am a fish out of water when it comes to dating or trying to and i self sabotage a bit to protect myself but there are so many things out of my control and i think that is what i struggle with the most
tldr i have been keeping my distance from my ex after he broke up with me he texted me after 2 weeks of not talking asking how i was doing 2 days later i responded and then he responded a minute after i responded does this mean anything
please someone help me figure out what to doidk if i should have posted this on here or in relationship advice
i was cool with this i even got a cool christmas present and i saw her smile as she walked inside her house
i woke up this morning and i still can not stop thinking about it i feel sick how do i stop caring its been months and i am still so hung up on him i am so sick of constantly thinking about him it is like i can not concentrate on anything else and then i just overwhelm myself with thoughts and stupid scenarios and end up getting upset i just want to hate him but no matter what i do i just can not
loneliness is an ever present feeling and honestly up until earlier this year i was having difficulty coping with it i figured out 5 coping mechanisms that work for me
and there was s he said come on there is nothing wrong with you i have anxiety too you are not the only one
i try to look at the reality point of view but i still feel like i am going to just have a huge mental breakdown and idk where i am going with this i just needed this off my chest
in particular she blamed me for not being excited enough when i open my presents and that i had been like that over the past few years
i am done three days later i woke up when would i want to wake up i have nothing to look forward in my life
if you picked up on how super dramatic that was you were not alone i imagine this relationship and even the idea of a relationship is physically draining
then people ask why i am an atheist mate there is no god if there was he would be at least a little fair
why because she is afraid of being controlled by the people that stands her closest she has anxiety problems and i am aware of them but i thought she could still maybe compromise
and then i feel even more guilty because i should be helping her and i should not be all worked up about it and just help even though i do
it is so bad that it has come to this point i do not know why no one wants to talk to me i have been the one to initiate and i am done
and even with them gone i set myself up to fail because of how much i have the need to be stable
yes shit really sucks right now but things will eventually get better the pandemic will hopefully sooner rather than later no longer be so heavy on our daily lives
i just kept blaming myself but i stayed on a path that was best for us and our future no porn no drugs or alcohol just growth
i miss watching movies with someone close since me and my online bff kind of felt apart and i do not really like doing it alone so maybe someone else feels the same
i left my hometown for about four years i moved back in with my parents last may because i did not have good financial prospects at the time
i believed in no sex before marriage but i am giving myself up because i am a who are and it just does not matter anymore
i just need to go out with them or at least a concrete answer in what to do or where to go not inspirational mumbo jumbo that includes psychologists
i do not know i am done with it all death seems like the only break i can catch in life so that is why i am here trying to figure out if there is something i can do to help it other then just suffering
i dissociate at least once a day from what i assume is my severe depression and stress it rarely has a particular trigger
avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism disapproval or rejection is unwilling to get involved with people unless they are certain of being liked
i have been bullied since little because i am not showing emotions i am unable to do anything against anyone because i am feeling bad for them
i am doing a surveyhttpsdocsgooglecomformsde1faipqlsfs66yvh2duitwc68e6ldfjpwdxdnmbpizn0hd8cghzrki7caviewformuspsf_link on the social and psychological effects of the covid19 quarantine for my ap research capstone class where i need to write a 5000word peerreviewed paper with the data i collect i would appreciate it if you guys could fill it out
i really am trying to get away from suicidal thoughts i was actually trying to plan out a possible future and now most of these plans are going down the drain
i word vomited to him about the night and if he is so hurt then he did not have to yell and block me among other things
the hardest thing for me is that we have not even had a fight no one cheated or did sometning like that but it all just went downhill and i could not do anything about it
she is very noise sensitive from migraines to the point where my fixing a meal stresses her out and although we are courteous to each other i get a lump in my throat whenever i notice that she is stressed or annoyed
i do not know what is wrong with me i just want to be normal i am done i do not want to kill myself but how do i end this suffering it hurts i am hurting so bad
but for now i was wondering if there is a good way to distract myself it is probably worth mentioning that i use escapism whenever i can
every morning when i wake up and i open my eyes the first thing i feel is just really bad stomach pain idk where this anxiety stems from but i just feel it so strongly in the morning when i wake up idk why that happens
she was my first love and the girl who i thought i would marry and spend the rest of my life with
i am 19 and have felt unwanted ever since i started going to school i was always numb to things around but always felt that dread of being lonely
i take seroquel and lithium also she said the remeron is a sedating medication i was hoping it would help give me more complete sleep right now it is broken i can fall asleep but i wake up frequently tried ambien but it does not keep me asleep for long stretches so hoping this will thank you
this post is going to be a long post but worth reading so please bear with me if it is too long scroll down for tldr
i experience intense anxiety mostly all the time i find new experiences very intense and exhausting based on a mix of high expectations of myself low confidence and social anxiety but i rarely appear anxious to others i am friendly polite and quite bubbly most of the time in public
everyday i listen to cigarettes after sex and cry for hours i miss him i wish i could magically bring him back
i was in a car accident when i was 14 years old which led to me having my left leg amputated and honestly have not been happy since i am now 23
i will be sitting there playing games with my friends or hugging my girlfriend and being full of happiness then it just hits me these depressing thoughts
i could not deny i love her and it made me feel awful i am an amazing person and if i set my mind to it i can accomplish this
here i am sitting outside while the wind is thrashing about and it is dark i normally enjoy the wind but i am tired today well all day
yes i sound fucking dramatic and i am the piece of shit in this situation for cheating but everything in my life leading up to this has been absolute shit and you two were literally the only people i had left because of this stupid bpd plus social anxiety or avpd shit whatever the fuck it is
you can not change a cheat you can not just wake up over night and not have anger management issues they are constantly yelling at me and i feel like they are right i also can not stand how i look
this has been eating me up inside for a while now i hope this fades away since maybe i am still processing the initial shock
i feel like an idiot for letting her back in and for believing her for allowing myself to keep pretending i am happy in a relationship that has felt wrong for months for trying to be supportive and kind and putting my concerns and needs aside because she is constantly ill or in some family crisis or a work crisis or some other reason it is selfcentered of me to ask her to listen to me
i feel starved for love and affection if i could just sleep all day and night to not feel like this i would
i have nightmares about people trying to kill me i have flashbacks of being bullied i hate everything about myself physical and personality wise i often eat until i feel like i am going to throw up i cut punch and bite myself i pick at my skin i have become super impulsive which has led to me running away and chopping my hair off among other things one time i went through a phase of starving myself i can get super excited out of nowhere like my emotions just flip being in two minds so much that i argue with myself out loud
3 bottles of 200mg motrin 40 count all of these easy to swallow pills the older i get the worse life seems to get with no signs of ever getting better
they laughed and watched me get mad i pretended not to care but i was very sensitive to it and i cried in my bed
i am bored and i have not slept and i have to work i am here in my bed it is 721 am and i am hungry
for the past year or so i have spent every second of every day with some kind of horrible thought in my head
i seriously want to do things that would probably require a hospital visit because it just seems like ecstasy and i have never been to this place before
it happens all the time no matter where i am i feel enclosed in an area and it makes me really nervous and sort of fall into despair
most days i am happy with my own company and reach out here and there to touch base with family and friends weekly
she also said she loved me it was so confusing to hear and i was so hurt i have grown out of it but i often think of that stage of my life
i felt so upset and empty that i had to go on tinder to talk to someone to feel a bit less alone becus all my friends are not here so i felt helpless
i also spent over 5 years developing websites but i hate working on them now have been hoping to sell them
i used to try to think of myself as a stable knowledgeable person but my self confidence just can not handle the reality i feel when confronted with how i look like
so my sister and her boyfriend put on swimsuits grabbed a water resistant speaker and played music well playing in our large kiddie pool with the dogs
for years i have not have the energy to regularly shower or brush my teeth i get tired just from doing literally nothing
she also texted me the same way and i gave up he did not left me food to eat for lunch and dinner
change of plans i might not be alone anymore this week end so it will be harder for me to kill myself i know this subreddit does not give any advices or suicide plans but can someone please tell me if this is a bad idea and i will just survive with a fucked up health
the topics i wish to touch on are the masks the false confidence the draining side of both of these also struggling with routines setting goals hitting a almost script as my therapist calls it
i was giving off a more positive vibe because i was focusing on the positives instead of the things that i did not like
at this point i was over her as she became trans and now here i am i left our friend group we had but am hoping to remain good friends
everytime something overwhelms me my mind immediately goes to alcohol it is the only thing that takes the edge off and keeps my thoughts at bay
and this have nothing to do with the quarantine it is a feeling that has been dragging me for at least three years
i do not want to be here but must stay to be there for my husband and other son so i keep living for them and try to keep smiling through the depression
i did not do very well and my parents kept pressuring me so i pressed forward without thinking too much about whether i really wanted this for myself
a week later i sent her message on her twitter as she unblocked me on a few forms of social media again
i honestly do not know how he would react if that happened i have no one to reach out to no one cares about me
there are other reasonsthe paranoia and trust issues and the perceived or real risk of pushing people away due to my constant need
i always tried with them eventually i just tried to stay out of the way once i realized how much their mom just did not want them to have any relationship with me
for the past year and 6 months i have been working with an international firm that is now setting up in my county i am their first and only hire so i am alone at work all the time which has its own dangers for a female working alone
i am suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder pureo and major depressive disorder recent college graduate 22m beginning graduate school mpa program parttime while working entry level job in my field
how do you cope with it again i do not feel guilty i hate myself perhaps a bit but i know that i was not at fault and so i mainly just hate him
then today for the first time that i felt that i can do this because i have already spent days preparing for the presentation
the idea of her and i that i held onto for 7 years after we teased the idea of being together and slept together was not at all what i had received
diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 4th ed washington dcnational institute of mental health the numbers count mental disorders in america and social phobia social anxiety disorder
i do not want to apply for jobs anymore i do not feel like pretending i give a shit about what is going on around me or about my life i am tired of thinking about my future or my parents future or their feelings or my feelings
but again she did not text me like she did before i thought maybe she was still going through what she was going through
i guess there is a thrill to it excitement temporarily though what is the science how does it relate to evolution survival caveman instinct it does not seem like a good way to live long term morally etc
we have been kind of messing around since we broke upstupid i know which he started after we broke up i mostly do it because i am lonely and miss him
i thought okay i can do this it is been more than a month now and i still feel absolutely heartbroken and cry a lot
after my last exam there was a barbecue we went in the basement and we kissed then other people came and we stopped
but by the time i got to the bar my ex was already pretty tipsy and things got bad at the end of the night
the thing is my ex is moving states away in a month i desperately want to see him just one last time
no generic advice please i have already spent a lot of time googling she was surprised and gave me a bottle of water and watch me as i take my meds
so it is been over a year since my break upi can not so i will not it is what it is rightall the people who have hurt me are happy
she never liked him for his moral values regards dating and relationship because he is all for openrelationship and is not a religious this was the explanation after we decided we wanted a clear exclusive relationship without having any destructive distraction from former contenders or what and obviously clean up our meaningless contacts
we were going to spend new years eve together and i was going to ask her to be my girlfriend again but now she is spending it with him
my plan is to overdose on live stream as soon as i get enough money to afford the meds to do so
even the smallest things will make me freak out i often break down crying or go into a fit of rage
is this just extreme depersonalization i have asked my therapist and she is not sure this seems to be very unusual to her at least
eventually i leave and i spend the rest of my day with my friends later in the night texts me saying she is drunk and that she is sad
i do not want feedback or advice or sympathy i just need to post this somewhere because it feels like if i do not i will start screaming
but i can not get rid of the feeling like i need to say goodbye i feel like once he moves i will be able to move on
here is the bottom line you are initiating any sort of contact with your ex direct or indirect you are chasing after her hence you are unattractive and often repulsive hence she pulls back even farther
feeling anxious about doing it i hope i planned it out well enough not really doing the things i wanted before i died just staying in bed
they are using my weakness of naivety they got me to attack the people i love because multiple types of therapy multiple clinicians i have tried meds done a lot of inner work spiritual work as well
how are you going to know what you are if there is nothing that say you are not against what compared to what in relation to who you have to make things you have to say it for it to be real and repeat it to make it stay
i do not know how she comes up with these things but she literally aggressively tries to convince us to convert to whatever these crazy obsessions are
but on the other hand my lonleness really hit me when i was working on something i could not enjoy i think everyone desires to have someone around themselves even when they have a fulfilling work
i also have ocd and i really want to help her get help when her parents can not give her help if you guys know anything that either of us could do to help properly diagnose her and get her to recive help please leave a comment thank you so much for the help and ideas
i do have a girlfriend who is about to go to the other side of the country for her studies and she barely gave any news for a week
it did not instead she began to leave the house and sleep at her moms house or her kids grandparents house
i have recently broken up with girlfriend of 8 years and nothing feels right anymore we said we would give it another go and it lasted a week before she said it was over to pursue things with someone else
i cried for no reason every other night and it is making me so confused why do i even cry i did not think of anything when i cried
but incompatibility eventually won out and he ended things because he could see that it was destroying our relationship we both agreed we wanted to leave things before they got sour
there is a high school that i needed to go in order to go abroadi made sure i was qualified for the school that i applied in and i took every steps carefully
a simple touch would set it off and its absolutely pleasurable i would be messed up for hours my friend always asks why her mother is like this and why she does this
forgive my bad sentence i get cold today so that i do not have the energy to write good sentence but he just said he got into another relationship we met in october 2019
it is hard to want to do anything really most of the time i just want to die because everything feels so fucking hard
it hurts he let us her behave that way and that he chose a life with less of me in it so that he could have her
i think an interesting tiny contribution to the loneliness epidemic would an app where if you are truly desperate you could flag yourself on the app and give a selfreported score of how lonely you are
she is called me a weirdo and a freak pretty much simply because i still care about her and i used to have feelings forward herloved her
feels good to be writing all this nonsense thanks if you read it allmy heart constantly hurts in a lingering pain of wicked loneliness
i might sound like an asshole but those are delicate matters and he brought that up at the wrong placetime and we do not know each other really well so wrong people too
this is what scares me because just accepting them as the truth without constantly fighting them has been feeling kind of comforting even though it is not and therefore i now think that all of this is true and that i truly am what the thoughts say i am
i really admire you as a person and you have made me feel ways about myself and feel types of ways in general that i never have before
i am a singer a song writer and write music and that is helps me so much but got a feeling this will end soon
almost all the people who i want to talk to are girls i am not sure myself if its because i want to be in a relationship or not because i feel like i am not ready but i miss being in one
talking about the most important lesson in life i love this one such a personality and such an energy i said it was obviously not true
your relationship and how both parties feel is a reflection of yourself hold a mirror up and really look inside and think about where you were lacking emotionally physically spiritually financially etc
but anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need
other mental health disorders can occur along with avoidant personality disorder treatments in these cases will be designed to help with the symptoms of each disorder a few of the conditions that most frequently occur with avoidant personality disorder include
the last times we were together it felt forced and i felt lonely being around them i feel like i am forced to make excuses
i have a decent job as a plumber and make decent money but every time i go out on my own i just fuck up somehow
if you want to check it out the link is httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvp7s9ikjpuhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvp7s9ikjpu to be honest i never finished it because it was too brutal and now i am even sort of considering just removing it let me know what you think
i figure i need a place to ventdocument things i have been needing to do this and it will either interest you or not
now as a 23 year old adult i have wondered if the same thing would happen or would it be worse i do not really want to die in pain but i am also scared to die
i wish i could have a normal life wish i could die without any regrets but mostly wish i would not die this alone
was it the right thing to return the funds and break nc i plan on going back to no contact but i did not want to have something that she could use since i know she can not save money
we broke up long story short because i broke her trust nothing too serious like cheating but because i had issues with mental health and addiction for the time that we were together she could not handle it any more
i am mostly fine thaey are giving me some antibiotics and standard treatment in iv form as well as some pills
so todays already been a bad day and it all started when a got a call from an unknown caller id now this could be anything telemarketer whatever but the last time i got a call from unknown number it was my ex who said things to me that still hurt me mentally today
a lot of my depression and i mean a lot of it stems from the way i look i am 65 and i used to weigh 295lbs
i hate myself so much i have been watching youtube videos and asked my mom for a hug i just feel so alone and unloved
my phone is so dry i know no one else considers me a friend because if no one is trying to talk to me or message me or tag me in stuff etc then that means no one ever thinks about me and that means no one really cares for me
to these pds symptoms also include thought distortions such as paranoia of bad events or thinking that people you see on the streets are talking about you
i keep a mask on everyday in the hopes of not looking like the lonely and depressed piece of shit that i am
since i began my teenage years i have been struggling a lot with ocd mostly in the form of checking things over and over again not trusting my memory which lead to doing things like refusing to hold knives just in case i cut myself and would not know covering my mouth in public so i would not think back on it later and think i said something offensive unintentionally checking emails and papers for the same reason intrusive thoughts so many other things
it is the only thing that takes the edge off and keeps my thoughts at bay my friend tells me this means i am an alcoholic even though i only drink twice a week max
i just can not do it anymore i am all alone my parents are not here with me and they would not help me much anyway
1 i can not open up about what i like what makes me happy or satisfied i tend to not showing my real and sincere emotions in other words i mask my real self because i feel like whenever someone knows what makes me happy for me it becomes useless and this thing does not bring pleasure to me anymore
i have not been getting along with my parents at all my stress levels are 1010 i am crying uncontrollably i have no desire to get dressed or leave my room i just want to be alone i hate myself and i have no desire to partake in any festivities

i have never been in any kind of relationship i am a virgin i hate the fact that i am attracted to girls because of their bodies i do not selfharm physically but i do it mentally because of that
i am jealous that they call each other boo and bby i am jealous that he is even thinking about giving her a christmas gift
i look terrible on photos and spend a good amount of time trying to change my mind about it yet i just can not fool myself into thinking beauty is just perceptional
i enjoy spending time with them but i do not feel anything romantic and cut things off because after a certain point i feel like i am just leading them on when i know nothing will end up flourishing with them
living day by day is a constant torture and fantasizing my own death would bring comfort there had been multiple attempts to end it all but i chicken out the last minute because of the amount of physical pain from committing the deed it is a blessing to others and a curse for me since i do not live in a country where firearms can be easily purchased
hi so i know some of you are avoidants here and might have experienced calling off a relationship because of your fears i wonder if you usually move on quickly after the break up or you still think or miss your ex and regret breaking up with them
the rest of highschool preparatory school i was alone again a group of girls took me in but mostly i was just there to not be by myself and even when they were nice and chill again i could never relate so we did not had much to talk about
you trusted them yet they took that trust and threw it away like it was nothingnow tell me how is that your fault
i was almost always with grandma in my younger years and to me she was mom when she died that was pretty much it
i think he is made a rash decision in his grief but i do not know how to change his mind except give him space
there are kind people in this world i am in tears because someone cared they may not be in front of you but out there in the universe are caring and generous people
yesterday he accused me of trying to hack him i did not and he had no proof instead of asking me directly he asked my sister
we decided new years day 2020 that we would make 2020 a sober year a better year for our health we had drinks on nye and have not since
psi did not mean to upset or to be rude to anyone if you felt like it i am sorry i know i should not be stalking her social media but its hard not to
this caused me to think nobody cared about my emotions and i became it severely depressed to the point of self harm
so the front row was never my choice as i grew older i realized the importance of education and the perk of being at the front row
i have had severe social anxiety due to trauma and attachment issues nearly my whole life and it keeps getting worse each year
i am sure by tomorrow afternoon i will have forgotten why i felt this way and go back to drifting aimlessly through my meaningless life until the next time these feelings boil up
it came out of nowhere to me we were laughing and talking like normal until she got off work last night and broke up with me
no man is an island we are not solitary animals the anxiety and emotional breakdowns i have been through because of you are irreparable
i even lost a sweet friend i made on reddit because of how pathetically slow i respond to people fuck this shit
but it should have been clear after the acetone incident i do not know how to repair hardware and have no business trying to do so without proper training and instruction
there was two more attempts in the hospital stuck my head inside of the toilet while in a second that the nurse got distracted damn toilet flushed now i have to remember that forever they noticed right away took me back to the bed gave me couple paper towels to dry my face i kept one of the and tried to chock myself with it they noticed again
we lived together the whole time we were always togethertldr i watched some spooky internet stuff and am freaking way out over it
she talks about nothing else except how shit her life is despite having a house a job she likes we have never struggled financially but nothing is ever good enough for her
basically i hate that no one bothers to talk to me along with that i feel like i will never be anyones first choice i am just there when the others are not available
i remember when one of my long term relationships went up in flames after months of reflection i recognized that the relationship did not end just because of my needy qualities or my exgirlfriends toxic quirks it had a more prominent issue on a fundamental and collective level the core values and beliefs between me and my ex were mostly incompatible unsurprisingly this caused massive friction
i am nothing but dirty no one would love someone like this wholly the doc wanted to keep them there and they agreed
i am an amazing person and if i set my mind to it i can accomplish this i almost have these passive suicide thoughts everyday that is becoming more active by actively planning my eventual suicide
however because these guys find me attractive they want to get to know me more than just in a friendly kind of way which makes me feel bad because i know that at some point i will have to awkwardly bring up that i only see them as a friend
we got back on our feet and made a life here well her mom died and her family is selling the house she is currently in
sometimes i have to ask myself who told me or if you ever had an experience with someone who turned out you are thoughts were true try to compare them and see this might not work but it helps me cuz most of the time it is all in my head
it is as if i awoke into a nightmare with everything i cared about disappeared forever in the darkness i walk alone
the girl friendzoned me for a whole year and made me her puppet because of how much i craved another persons warmth
and this is why i am asking what do you struggle with the most when it comes to social interactionsbecause only by knowing what the real problem is you will then be able to overcome it
now that they know i just feel like less of a person to them i have pushed them away and hide away in my room i do not hang out anymore
i am going to drive somewhere to hopefully find a meal i wanted to see my family so badly but mental illness forces me to be weak isolated and alone
in the past i have had my mother and two of my siblings attempt to kill them selves and i do not think i can handle this i love him so much i am panicking i can not imagine letting him go and i do not want him to feel this way i have offered to stay by his side and to get him help he is declined everything i have offered is there anything i can do please
i was adopted at birth and all i know about my biological parents is that it was a random hook up and that they were both single parents who each had kids of their own
how do i get over this if he did not do anything wrong he did not cheat he was not a monster he did not have any big issues so what do i do now it is hard to not talk to him every single day
i hate seeing all the christmas stuff on social media even pre pandemic every christmas so far has been nothing but pain
so this post goes out to anyone prospecting to see a escort they are getting more expensive and i am going to it is not worth doing it long term
i feel like i can not get over her and that i do want to make things work with her again but i do not know if that is a possibility anymore
it makes me so depressed i feel like i can not do anything i starve myself eatting once a week to avoid as much pain as possible
tldr was in a mutually toxic relationship ex does not want anything to do with me aside from when he wants sex do not understand why i put myself through this when i know i deserve better or should be trying to move on and focus on myself do not know the steps to actually trying to get over him do not know if he still cares at all or why that even matters to me
i am so bored so tired so desperate for privacy and so lonely and my city is about to enter another lockdown from coronavirus
i thought my world ended with the loss of my ex i lost weight from not eating it is been 3 months with no contact and i still have dreams of her
my only wish for this christmas is for me to be able to get through this until midnight so i could tell my family especially my mom about my health condition
what ended up happening i would notice myself staring at the code cursor blinking and it was as if my brain would refuse to work on that
antidepressants i do not know i take pills for my heart sickness already which effects my sleep i get almost no sleep and i can not get up in the morning without forcing myself
any nice subreddits ppl on reddit are so mean and toxic i just ask for help or a question and ppl hurl insults at you and unleash their bad energy i might just leave reddit
this went on for a little and one time when we were out having dinner she even dropped the i love you and i thought it was super cute and sweet but also worried me a little more about how fast things were moving
when i was little i did not now it but i had a pretty messed up childhood you try and get help but all they do is diagnose you and drug you
i have never made a reddit post before i am sorry if this is jumbled but i am hurting and i do not know what to do
i felt like i was left abandoned in this world i never had the opportunity to go out after high school and learn and experience things
my general anexity and inability to be what society deems normal kept me from getting a job well almosti worked for the family construction business starting at age 15 to 21 where i had wrecked my back
it just fucking hurts so much when my friends are in a private room on discord i tell them to drag me in there and i just end up sitting alone on the general chat
do you know how fucking traumatizing is to change in a boys lockers roomhaving a rib cage that is not a size small it fucking sucks
at that moment i felt my hearth broke like never my ex made me so insecure and i lost 20 pounds after we broke up
i did confront her about it and she says that it is because she does not have the chance and that she likes texting me
i did not want the story to end there so i agreed to stay friends but deep down i thought that if i stuck around and put the work in i could win her
i hope you are happy we were going to have two dogs a cat a rabbit and fish a ton of fish
then when she got to the city where i met her where i live she must have slept with 30 guys
this bothers me so much that i try on daily basis to distract myself and not think about how this feeling of loneliness feels like there is a black hole inside my belly
when i was receiving the man i was not crying anymore i do not know what to do i wish i had not spent so much of my life alone
it is not even anywhere close to the first time for this to happen to me and i can not even say it is not my fault i am an alcoholic i make bad decisions i risk things i do not feel good enough or accepted by anyone other than older men who want to get into my pants and then i am surprised and hurt when they decided to force that i am literally fucking stupid
i also lost interest in school which i liked before i even lost contact to my best friend for several months
and honestly if medication and therapy does not work then i honestly think i am fucked to live with a mindset that is just constantly degrading me and reminding me of how much of a bad person that i fucking am
problem is i have no support network since all four of my friends moved from my town during last year or two
only i got the opposite i had a couple people comment that i should not be putting my problems on that platform that i am just trying to get attention
my ex broke up with me a few months ago a very messy break up we continued talking for a bit but it ended in a negative but neutral way basically i said if you want to reach out later once things cool down we can be still be friends
we promised since the beginning communication with each other is the most important thing after all these arguments we have taken a break it did nothing
i feel like i did not try hard enough or show them what they meant to me i did not put in enough effort
another thing she does is if you even dare to disagree with her she completely over reacts in a weird way
i do not know how old it is but it is black and white so it is pretty old5 years he lost his job due to covid and i was still working ft
this medication made me very emotional it made my thoughts even worse and deeper by this point in my rant i do not feel like saying anymore i want to kill myself
nothing i say to my therapist comes with insight but everything comes with the expectation of improvement everything is a personal fault not a fault due to others than me
it is always just been a day to really drive home the point of how alone and removed you are from everyone else
has different desires such as sleeping with other people having sex with them etc does not give a flying fuck about the way i feel
strength does not come from what you can do it comes from overcoming the things you once thought you could not i mean i have good days sometimes but i always get put back down quickly
i am graduating 4 years of college and yet again it seems as if the one i fell in love with is no longer here
during this interview you are free to skip any question you want somewhere that i would come home mad all the time to you i wanted a happy balance
and for the first time i was brave enough to talk do not give up do not give up on people do not give up on yourself
he lives in the hood so it is not about money she told me she is been having sex with him in our bed
if i am not romantic enough she will get mad at me if i do not text her for like a half a day she will get mad at me
anyway i have always felt at my worst when i have felt powerless it is always felt to me like that would be the right method i have just never imagined it with such detail and so often as i have these last few months never has the fantasy felt like such a cool wave of relief
my sister is having a baby next year so i figured i might as well kill myself beofre than so i do not end ruining that childs life either
what i am wondering now is whether it is okay to keep reaching out to him every now and then so he sees i am really there or whether that could mean additional stress and make him feel worse about himself
i was scheduled to be induced and she was perfectly healthy at the time however due to doctors negligence and not paying attention to signs of distress
i am a 17 year old male since the pandemic started i have struggled a lot with depression anxiety and stress my sex drive is basically nonexistent and i rarely get erections anymore is this a normal symptom of mental issues will it get better if my mental health gets better
we talked today and she said i hurt her so badly that she does not know if it is a good idea to get back together
so what if i have experienced suicidal thoughts for the first time ever this year because it has been incredibly catastrophic for me does that make me less deserving of an answer i was in the law but never saw anything like this shitshow that just happened to me this week
what is the point of having all these people wishing me acting like they care when in reality they are just following social customs all i am asking for is a group of close friends who acctually enjoy talking to me not just messaging me because its my birthday
this is how it has been for a long time i am introverted as well and do not have many friends here
when going through breakups it is totally normal to fall into multiple episodes of negative self talk self belittlement or selflamenting the challenge is getting yourself out of these episodes
but with this mindset i was able to after that yeah she did her friend took my side in all of this truthfully
every time i go out somewhere it is almost all white people and i am constantly envious they do not have to go through this because they are the majority
please help me for moving on in fact i still love him he said he want to marry me someday but i got betrayed again man i can not believe what he said back then before he dumped me this is painful so i want to forget him and everything he said i just want to be happy and have no trust issue thanks
the task you gave me takes at least 3 hours to complete and you gave me one i went to ethics
got the facilitys certification revoked now criminal charges are pending against a few in managementi think i just need to remain single for a while and continue doing therapy
i did not really elaborate on the situation in my last post but i have lived with him for maybe 56 years before he broke it off with me
whatever break up you are going through write down this first of alli just recently went through a break up and its been taking a toll on my health
when in social situations a person with avoidant personality disorder may be afraid to speak up for fear of saying the wrong thing blushing stammering or otherwise getting embarrassed you may also spend a great deal of time anxiously studying those around you for signs of approval or rejection
for every moment we are given we have to realize that we must be thankful and grateful for it this analogy always creates a sort of confuzzle inside of me
and the fact that i found out he lived a neighborhood over like a few months ago he told me he lived the next city over but that was a total lie
i am scared now though i wrote them a long message about it and confessedi have been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 4 years 18m
i am back to being alone this is one of the reason why i do not have instagram who is going to follow me anyway
who do not disinterested you by the first few interactions i cried really bad then because on nights when i would not even see my mum she was always there
i am a drama queen a princess a baby every time i show an ounce of emotion so i bottle it up and we will explode
it does not help that i am in so much pain because of him i genuinely think i have ptsd from it and no one of our mutual friends that know how much he hurt me are willing to let him go
i have wasted the last 23 years of my life and i can not see myself doing anything with the time i have in front of me
so i got to do what i got to do and try to move on as best as i can not sure how long it will take but i know i must keep trying
tried to made me think it was all my fault and saying that i lack the love it requires to forgive and move on
i basically do not care anymore about learning how to do thingsi love you angie hope i helped you in some way
yet she haunts my dreams i do not know what to do i wonder if he thinks about our time together and wants it back or why he has not reached out
after four years relationships i only sent him a message leave me alone and do not try to find me and blocked him everywhere
i had a walk earlier today and walked past the graveyard to go to a coffee shop to buy some breakfast and i saw this young couple walking towards their childs grave it is so sad
instead today is a painful reminder of my ex friends and how they still have people close to them but i do not
i genuinely think i am garbage even though i am trying to work on myself people sometimes think that i am talking to them
i am so fucking lonely my mind is totally fucked up and i can not socialize i had kind of psychosis and my iq has dropped tremendously i have a few friends but they are not consistent contacts i do not know what to do
basically i think i like someone and want to talk to them more and become a relationship but then as soon that night when i relive my manly urges i feel like absolute crap and i realize i do not actually like that person and that would be fine i think if it was once or twice but this happens every single time i think i like someone
she let me hug her before she left for the last time and i started sobbing on her shoulder basically begging her not to leave
and when i tried to drink some more i just could not stop hearing my sisters and my best friends words in my head
it is hard when people do not take it that seriously or basically imply i need to get over an unfortunate comment made by a counsellor
when i was 11 i tried to talk with my parents about it and i basically got no as an answer i never tried again i kept it to myself and it got worsewho could have guessed
and if you do by some miracle get your ex back with all the scummy quick fixes fake gurus feed you the relationship is just going to fall apart again at some point since she is going to see that you have not really changed
anyways to get to my point i hate the way i view things now my exams will start tomorrow but i have not studied my fucking lessons
he was tired but he called me and told me that he is going to take a month off and get back into the labor force
when the episode ended i asked to make the bed since we slept on it with no sheets the night before
why does she want to meet me i have told her multiple times i do not want to be friends i can not be friends with someone i was or am in love with
after a lot of deliberation i have decided to delete my facebook idk if anyone can relate but ever since this breakup i have been feeling alot of anxiety especially the fear of seeing him with someone else so last night i said fuck it and deleted both my facebooks
we had a conversation about love languages and he said his was gift giving n stuff he really likes crabs and crustaceans so i bought anything and everything related that i saw
sometimes i see myself talking to someone in some store or something and think if they can really see me or ear me
is this normal do you always love the people you once loved or am i just not doing a good job at truly letting go and dealing with my feelings
i am honestly most at fault as to why we did not work out my words he would never admit he does not want to hurt me
i can just look at the wall all day and just be sad my chest feels emptyimagine a perfect gift the one that makes the recipient eternally happyyou can not think of anything tangible or practical
today has been the day when i have finally end the relationship with my father i was tired of being the because of every that went wrong in his life
i do not want anyone to feel how alone and worthless i felt and still feel typing this out i can barely hold it together and i just do not want to feel this anymore
after a lot of good days and bad days more suicidal thoughts and thoughts of worthlessness and my family being better without me i am doing better
he has not made a genuine effort in finding his own home for the seven months i lived with him even despite the large amount of money he makes per year
so i guess my question would be why he felt lonely though i wanted with all my heart to be there for him and i was there for him every day
maybe it is just me but putting a stop to a certain activityhabit is easier than to have to start something new
i guess the pictures and stuff made me realize i missed her a lot more than i cared to think about
when i asked my mom a few weeks ago to take me to that doctor she said that her the doctors daughter was getting married and that we have to wait for a while
every time i feel sleepy when it is bed time i have to go and eat something first even if i am barely keeping my eyes open and then go to sleep right away after
i hope my friends realise that i was not seeking attention and learn a lessoni hope my family realises that i was not sad all the time for nonsense and learn a lesson
in these holidays he went to see his father that lives in wa and did not realise he would be moving so i was just lying in bed browsing reddit and i get a text that i am not coming back from wa this is not a prank i just did not realise i was moving until i got here
and that is the most destructive thing of all i have found is the constant hope that things will change even if you change
i have mentioned this to my doctors and to a therapist all pushed it to one side the problem is i am not overweight or underweight so nobody sees a problem
i finished grad school my ex had the audacity to say that his undercutting comments while we were together about me doing my masters were his way of motivating me
i am over here having a panic attack all day long damnit why today why i just feel so broken sitting around and wondering if he will ever realize what he had
but the fact is if she keeps on calling me messaging me with her photos and sending me pictures of her prepared food
i gained a porn addiction very quickly and am still far far from getting anywhere close to beating iti need someone to talk please chat with me
i can not think of any comments that would make me feel better and i rarely get interaction from this app anyway
and now that he told me that he is with her i realise that like the day he texted me he missed me he was already with her
how do i tell them that i am not comfortable talking with them about this matter and say to my mom that i want to start therapy
and i also personally took offense that you would put that much thought and creativity into gifts for your friends where all i got from you is a novelty wallet and all the crankiness and unfair tempers
i just tried to talk with my mom about what she thinks of marijuana and i could not change her mind in the slightest
but be an adult and be upset he told me it was lemon water i tried asking if i could have some because i was thirsty
i also have a long history of failing to find the right solution to this problem so whenever i try something that should actually work like meditation this feeling flares up like crazy and makes it very hard to focus
anyway now the wedding is over managed with 1 just episode at lunch in 2 day wedding and the rest of time was fine
or at least just realise that there is someone out there who could care about him so much that it is okay to let people get close
i did this like 45 times but i stopped after 3045 seconds each time that is the closest thing i have ever done to an attempt even though i thought i was better
i can not lose her i need her forever in my life please help meso ig i lost a really good friend over breakup
it was one of those situations that felt like a last opportunity and now i sit here feeling like my chance are gone there is no hope etc
to me it feels like she regrets her decision but is too afraid to let me know because ever since the day after we broke up i went radio silent and have not been posting on social media at all
i got fired from my job i was with for 10 years 6 months after my gf left then covid started 2 weeks after i got canned
i will meet a nice girl and then run her off because of my strange bondforming behavior i usually love being alone
i had a break down of selfharm three years ago resulting in me having a sort of falling out with god
ok so last night i busted out crying for the first time in 4 years my mom came and talked to me
sometimes i envision myself in a nice dress makeup done for me lying in a cold dark boxwhat will happen when i cease to exist what will happen
i wish she did not have a choice and that i was the only option but that is not the case her friends are no help either for me but that is expected
it is been harder to resist texting him he mistreated me and sometimes i feel deep pain and anger because of it
not shit in a i want to kiss or hear them say they love me kind of way it is more of a
i am leaning more towards lazy currently like i have a good job despite the pandemic i own a home with the love of my life
i wanted to know that if and when things got better there would be a possibility of us growing into something
i do not think i could do this if you do not move these are the things i was talking about somthing changing
redditcomrsuicidewatchcomments25igd7whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt which is always linked from our sidebar community info on mobile guidelines what is wrong with me why do i feel these ways
i dated two girls both were toxic and the first one yelled at me for hours about how i dropped them the moment i got bored
the best hypothesis i can come up with is that it is some kind of defense mechanism that has managed to divert whatever chemical that causes depression to my pleasure sensorssynapses
i was getting into talking to friends working on myself doing things i enjoyed lately however it is been harder to not think about him
it has taken time i am working on it everyday every moment through the ups through the downs through my own moments of lack of faith and trust god always guides me through and allows me to know that everything is for my highest and greatest self it really is just that the hardships we experience the anxieties the set backs are really solely for the purpose of realignment our greatest gift
but i am just tired i know when the clock hits 12 i will not recieve any merry christmas any you are special in my life my messages will be empty like any other day some of you may send dm i appreciate it but i know i will not finding meaning in any of them and i do not want to feel shit anymore i want to be free from everything
this has been a rough year for me22 m 3 major surgeries and 5 complications later my most recent surgery was 2 weeks ago i have been struggling to keep my head above water for a while all of this has been emotionally exhausting
i feel like a car with two drivers and the two drivers want to go in complete opposite directions part of me has a deep love for humanity and part of me has a deep hate for humanity they both feel equally real and valid and i feel them influence me in everything i do
the good moments were really good and the bad moments were really really bad lots of fun lots of cuddling lots of laughter and joy but also lots violence abuse crying pain loneliness
not only this but i had this desperate feeling of needing to cry like a feeling of emptiness and as i write this i am sat alone in my room crying for no reason
one of the hardest part of being lonely or thinking that you are lonely is having that realization that people actually do not care about you
i asked her to go to some art exhibition early october now which she initialy declined but then asked to go because she wants to take some photos
i knew the week following up that something was wrong she was becoming more distant and did not see me at all

is it making me escape or elevate it is making me escape it is not an elevate you started to hide from me and not care how i felt about your lack of effort
i still feel like i am a little kid hiding behind a chair a little kid being forced to sit in a mans lap

i just want to go in an be normal for once or least add onto things without being weirdand if you do not have discord then message me on this i am sure we can figure something out

we went out with a group and one of his best female friends 34f was there there is just noone i can reach out to
she had repeatedly lied to my face about it not once she did ever say they were sleeping together and she chose to lie about it
life has been miserable for a good long time now i mean i can not really ever say i have ever been all that happy but the last 67 months have been a new low for me

if you wanted an 116 inch laptop with a matte screen and great viewing angles then you should have spent the extra money to buy it instead of spending the extra money to buy hardware you did not love two times over for gods sake stop doing this
if someone asked me to rate life i would give it zero stars all i have ever known is sadness and disappointment i have either been hurt or hurt others there was never happiness peace or fulfillment

my mom is scared the old lady might have covid the tests come back negative they compare me to my other friends on top high schools and better kids in my year
grieving a relationship is so hard in covid you can not go outside so it is hard to get my mind off of it and i do not have any friends really so i can not have help from them in whatever way and my family is not emotional so besides here there is no where i can really share this and him and my pain
after summer i started college and i started hanging out with less people from my highschool i just hanged out with a small group of them the ones who i thougth they really value me after being with them i started feeling less and less lonely and more apreciated but the key point that changed how i felt was a change i made in my mindset i suddenly did not need others judgment or aproval for being happy with myself when you start apreciating and loving yourself no matter how lonely you feel you migth be able to find inner peace
i could not live with a feeling like i will not ever see happiness i was thinking at least 3 times a day about how would i end it all
keep repeating in my head all the time for 4 months i spam her and she then puts her instagram on pause to get me to stop
i feel like i was always a disappointment to my parents they always complained about something and even if i did the opposite they still complained and they only ever cared about their reputation and honestly i truly believe they would prefer a dead son over a gay son because they made such homophobic remarks when asking me if i were gay because i was not dating but i was antisocial specifically to make it look like that is the reason and not because i am gay
it is pretty much all i have known since i was about 1213 25 now my parents older siblings never really took any interest in any of the things i was interested in
does anybody have success stories of being persistent in changing and winning their exgirlfriend back i know everybody says an ex is an ex and nothing can be done but i am shure she was the one for me
i feel like my heart has been torn out and is 1000 miles away thanks for reading this and letting me vent
going to try keeping this as short as i can so basically i have struggled with anxiety and depression for years now and it is better than it was before
its like all of my efforts towards the relationship are worthless at this point why do i even try some men are fucking clueless
and beside no one would miss me maybe in the beginning yes but a year later no one would i can even say i do not fully know either
she went on a rant about how the way my family including me behave during christmas is the reason she does not like christmas anymore
love life never happened cool and fun experiences never happened sense of being close to someone never happened dating never happened women never happened not even women friends no nothing friends never happened nothing happened in terms of actual meaningful real connections and relationships absofuckinglutely nothing n of t h i n g big fucking nothing happened
might sounds cheesy but i could drown in the pain or take my power back n get my shit together hold no animosity and move forward that is my plan i have no regrets 2020 let us try it again next year with my full heart and effort
merry christmas although i have not been celebrating it neither considering it as a holiday since i was 12 she was able to help me see my body positively after my ex ruined it
every time someone does something shitty to me now all i can think about is them regretting it after i kill myself this year
but like i said it did not work out i did not manage to get it and i did not have the money to pay for it
i wish my mom did not have a miscarriage then she would have stopped after my sister and i would not have been born to this family and go through hell inside and outside my family
since then i have found they bought a house and got engaged she was adamant that they were madly in love and they have been together since january
i do not know how to handle it or if i should say something at all and how she is jealous of me
one of them a boy i will call c was hands down the most decent person out of all of us and probably the nicest in the school as far as i could tell but he was lumped in with us for some reason anyway probably just because everyone else had their established cliques and he managed not to piss off n
and you know how much i love animals that i am no longer pain she will be able to grieve and then hopefully move on with her life
i am worried about him but i have finally accepted that there is nothing i can do to bring him out of this spiral
i can not help but think to myself that the teachers are rating my assignments with high grades because they feel sorry for me because of my history
i really do have feelings for her and feel really sad right now but i just need to know if i am making the right decision because i have never dealt with schizophrenic people before and just need advice
i blame it on having such a good life that i just want a bad day to be normal however i am starting to think this may be a sort of unhealthy masochism
even now in current times i have been dating a boy for a year and a few months now and i wanted to tell my parents about him
i do not know i have been enjoying one persons company the most and the thought of seeing them again is honestly amazing
i also have no friends and have extreme difficulty even being able to get through a single conversation like it almost hurts me to do so and not just walk away
but we had to end it because it was too malignant for both of us a bit like a toy she was not considering anymore that she went back to because she was bored
i always go for guys that i do not find physically attractive at all it is like their personality brain washes me because we get along so well
a lot of my life i have had nobody to talk to about my feelings and what i go through or have gone through
i do not have the same optimism she has for life nothing i have been born with ensures me a long life several of my eleven diagnoses only lead to death with or without medication i have since made my peace with probably being a statistic
i feel like i will be completely forgotten about to waste in a ditch and burn in hell i am scared and something wrong with me
i am just stuck in this environment that hates me and it is my own fault for being stupid enough to smoke in the house while people were still awake
i was so close to her prior to this but she became needy and wanting my attention all the time but now i do not even feel interested in talking to her is it normal to lose closeness to a person in a snap of a finger
i plan to do it somewhere out of the house so nobody close to me has to be the one to find me
i just do not know what to do anymore and whit each day i am getting more and more tired of trying it so i am even starting to think i should just drop out which i can not really do because a lot of money and effort was put into getting here
i brought her flowers i wrote her a love note on the back of our favourite photo for her to keep and i brought a promise ring
essentially like a mechanic who could with all the proper precautions and care to not damage anything in the process investigate the issue identify what it really is with sufficient accuracy and precision and then offer a path of safe tests and fixes that culminate in a lasting solution
or i take things he says or acts the wrong way these things lead me into crying a lot do not go out and burn something down
any future i would have would be lonely and tiresome and i do not want that i want to live life fully but do not have the capability to do so i just want to go now i am done
they would take responsibility for their actions probably come up with list of goals or something and live their life in a way that gives them a sense of meaning and purpose
i follow the voice and i try to swim to the top but when i get there there is ice its clear and really thick but i see them the people yelling
the only exception to this rule is when you spend your money on experiences with other people so if you took that extra 10000year and spent it on some weekend getaways to new and exciting places with your friends or family then you might get happier
and as cliché as it may be i also think about the inevitability of death one january 2nd i plan on ending my life
and no matter how jaded or cynical or misanthropic i become i still realize this that is why i have tried to reach out and be with others no matter how much it sickens me
my class split into 4 different sections each with some people it is not a big deal all my friends are still in the same school but still the interaction lowers
i was saved 7 years ago instead of killing myself i went and checked myself into a hospital they kept me there for 4 months they explained to me that despite all the evidence i had to the contrary life would get better
he did not live close so we literally would only hang out here especially when my roommates were gone so it feels so weird
3 months fast forward i found myself letting his interest in front of mine he would not be so sweet anymore and i started to catch myself that i am behaving very needy and clingy
i am so used to being on the other side mostly this would not bother me because this has happened a couple of times now but this time
my now ex gf f18 let us call her j broke up with me f20 yesterday she seems absolutely wildly in love with him like there is no way she is going anywhere
i am a very caring person during this pandemic i have reached out to everyone i know especially to those who may be struggling more than others but no one has reached out to me in return
i studied a lot yesterday than i usually did since my attention span became low due to my depression had proper food pulled myself up and went out did not know how i felt but i just moved on my own
i have been crying so much and i never cry i have been very upset with myself telling myself terrible things about myself
first of all please excuse my mixed up english i am not a native speaker i was never mrpopular but still i did alright for myself
she is a really great person honestlyi do not want to be the reason she hurtsi am worried because she does not need this toxicity in her life
5 years and i never had any doubts i was so in love and we often would talk about getting married and having a future together
needless to say i was ecstaticon sunday the topic of saying i love you and me having trust issues was brought up again
no one can tell you how to stop your depression but there could be things to help you get through this
i also can not stand how i look i self harm nearly every night that is the only thing that makes me feel alive
my girlfriend of nearly 5 years just broke things off with me i am heartbroken i do not know what to do
a few hours passed and i calmed down i sympathized with her and apologizedit is a sign given by mafia boss or capo that the one given that kissis going to die
what got me was that she did not think of me i really felt like i was not important to her and so she is unaffected by the breakup
i know that if i tested my luck that is how the world would retaliate it is just something that seems so me
nothing feels quite real and everything feels alien even though i am home i do not quite feel like me like i am an observer looking out
i am trying to move on since we are filing for divorce in a week i have been doing okay mentally so far but these dreams are bugging me
this christmas is hard for me since last year it was these festivities what in a way triggered my break up
a few months ago in a text they mentioned that they have been struggling recently and have moved back in with their parents due to this
i feel so fucking guilty i have started believing he is looking for therapy because of me he tells me it is fine but i do not believe him i can not believe him
that i rewarded his behavior towards me i just wish i could forget i wish i could move on
i recently graduated with my masters degree and am finally living out my career goals i just landed my dream job this year
the relationship was good we cared about each other and we still talk everyday this was a great relationship but it was not a this is the love of my life relationship
now many halfbaked projects fall apart in reality but there is nothing wrong with trying and learning from failure is there anyone out there with some software skills who thinks this is a decent idea and wants to give it a try
do not treat any ops post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can not change their minds or be helped anyone who is able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living even if they have also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide made a suicide plan or started carrying it out
they are so cold too i do not feel like they show me any support i just feel anxious around them and i try to avoid talking to them
me and my bf has been together for one year and we are 20 now i am his first gf and he is my first serious bf too
i wish it my friendships or even companionships could last enough i do not want to look anyone in the eye again i no longer wish to be seen
when one of my friends dad got arrested i gathered everyone up and got a care package together and went to his house to clean it up his dad was an alcoholic single parent so friend had to take care of himself at 17 i have my most fond memories with all of them together and individually
i have been in serious relationships before and have watched them enter new relationships it hurt so badly but not as much as this one i really wore my heart on my sleeve for this guy and i still can not believe it is really over
i guess i was just irritated because it was holding you down and i wanted to whisk you away to be mine and shape our future too
it is been a rather lonely ride here and given travel restrictions this year i have been unable to fly back and forth as much as i usually do in any given sane year my familys peppered all across the globe and i have been on my own without travelling since february
i will not go anywhere in life despite being privileged enough to have a roof good food and a family that loves me even though they definitely do not understand what is going on
i waited 3 months for a scheduled meeting with the new therapist only to find out the insurance would not cover it
who he was following what he was liking people who he had hooked up with in the past that he was still following that he wanted to stay close to because he believed in meaningful relationships
i no longer believe in people and life seems to me not worth trying because apart from pain there is practically nothing
and now i do not get that there is no text and that is so hard have game night with people but nobody ever wants to do anything
i almost immediatly moved in with her since we were both 100 sure we would spend the rest of our lives together we both never felt anything like this before
how do i stop crying for someone non stop who is not crying their selfs to sleep over me i can not keep feeling like this it has not even been a week
she brought him food from time to time and found out she was trying to rekindle things he told me he chose me and he is trying to cut her off but she was just persistent
it is fine to spend some time being unproductive because of the breakup but if you continue down that path you will only make it worse for yourself
because eventhough i am pretty sure i do not have an eating disorder i think what i do is not quite normalso where is the line when do eating habits etc classify as disordered
suddenly about a couple hours ago i felt my heart beating a bit faster and i had a sense of anxiousness and i did not know why
i try to have fun i really do but i can not i just can not stop thinking about killing myself it is starting to get to me
i worked most of today i am a community carer and we had a bit of cheeky banter i though that maybe she was going invite me over for a bit but instead we had a cigarette at the door and that was it
do not ever come up to me and act sorry or with feelings of regret i already gave you chance after chance for years and you messed it up every time
but they are getting older my dad in his earlymid 60s and my mom 6 years behind it is like i am grieving them as if they are dying or dead when they are still here
i do not mind being single i am even glad for it since i got my life together i just feel haunted by them
today at christmas brunch i actually broke down and had to leave and i have never had a mental break like this before
please tell me what i can do to make her feel that is its okay for me to have a little alone time without me worrying about her trying to take her life
silly i let him but i just was not ready 5 days agoi have developed this fear of meeting new guys but i am innately lonely its this weird conundrum
i do not enjoy living at all not a single bit i just hate it and i want to end the pain once and for all
11 years of doctors appointments clinical trials surgeries and radiation and nothing has changed nothing will changei had a discussion with my ex just yesterdayit was about our brakup
but then other times i am like fuck it i want to just do shrooms with friends and self medicatei really wish things would have worked out between us for the better and wish she would have fought for us
relationships come and go in life and while it does hurt when you lose one it is far from the end of the world
they have not been the nicest to my mum and i feel that if i start talking to my cousins my aunts would want to talk to my mother which will because drama
she also said that she believes that we are soulmates and i really agree she also told me this when we broke up
and her dad was murdered the week that she was scheduled to come here with a marriage visa and shortly after her first and only marriage ended in a divorce
we have all hit rock bottom at some point relative to the rest of our memories and though they can not all be treated as equal humanity shares a general base for suffering
thank you and may you all have peace love and safety i am here at walmart parking lot in my car it is what it is there is not anyone around but it is a safe area i have blankets and pillows
i am looking for communities that may be able to help me but i am not too sure whether i can find help here
i am sick of everyone judging me and i am sick of people treating me like i am the bad guy i am so angry
my parents are also very religious and i am not on the surface ppl think i am cuz i am surrounded by religious ppl
a good example is that a high school friend of mine invited me to a discord server with some of the nicest people i have met i talked for maybe 3 days then i never messaged any of them again
i told her i do not plan on having another relationship any time soon as i plan on chasing my dreams which happen to be in the royal marines
but nothing happened after that day nothing more was said and the only thing that happened was my office getting moved
not only do they not like you but they are like an injured cat ready to fuck you up with their claws
4 the paranoid thoughts would give me hours of anxiety each day and then i would realise they were just stupid and felt relieved then the cycle started all over again
any and all help will be greatly appreciated thank youwhat is wrong with me why am i empty am i insane am i real who am i what is true
i am the only one probably who still did not receive any notification on home page about the facebook dating today i told her i struggled with the lack of communication and overall neglect
i hate this feeling where i am afraid of my ex yet i still want to be with them is it because i am afraid of loneliness is it because i have not moved on yet
there is a lot out there about what to do during the coronavirus and all of it involves staying in the house when it is acknowledged that such an existence is incredibly lonely welcome to my entire fucking life it sucks does not it but you get to leave it eventually the advice people share only helps if you already have a friend group to do it with
on saturday i had to break up with my boyfriend of 6 soon to be 7 years his drinking had been problematic for quite a while
other than the person looking dazed or staring into space without seeing anything are there certain things that a person does i once read something where someone was described to be sitting in place and trembling while brushing his knuckles against his lips for about an hour or two before he came out of his dissociation for the lack of a better term
friends and girlfriend left me months ago i have no one to celebrate with feel like no one gives a shit about me
so well my post deviated off tangents plenty times forgive me it probably even gets contradictory many times you can probably say its my rotten head causing it sorry
at the end of the day it does not matter who falls asleep next to you but that you will be the one to pick yourself up in the morning again
this shit is so hard to do on my own and all i keep thinking is she is talking to other people already moving on and i can not even bring myself to do that
i lost one of my best friends to covid and he was pretty much the one i video chat with every other day he was working on a video game and he always told me about how hard it was to market such a thing in a giant market he kept pushing back the announcement because he always felt not ready and scared
i met a man who was 11 years older than me he persuaded me that i was mature for my age
i think i will use again and then i will end it i am all alone for christmas it seems fitting for the last one
last night i took a xanax and an old ssri from the prescription i last had i slept ok for a while but woke up in the middle of the night
i am a 17 year old girl in october right after i got covid i was trying to fall asleep but could not for hours
she cuts and has at several different points cut and then immediately regretted because it was too deep and she was scared
i have done a lot shitty things in my life just trying to pursue some kind of happiness my good my bad from my deepest regrets to some of the best moments of my life
i wish i would just die in my sleep i have nobody who would even care if i did why the fuck can not my death just happen already
at first this is difficult only because your negative will power will do everything in its power to stay in power and stay alive
despite this i have worked hard in my studies to show my worth and put all the effort into things i can do like write go to class hang out with friends and other things
he is my best friend relationship or not he is a genuinely good person that i strongly admire and want to be around both platonically and in this case romantically
it seems that i am comfortable in my anxiety because when i am calm and stable i can clearly see i am stuck in a deep deep horrible empty sadness
i can not believe i am here now chilling in my own house with my cat binge watching travel shows on bbc and i am just so calm so
it is been close to a year now of her humiliating herself apologising to this guy asking him what exactly she did wrong
i am just giving out my new product to get the word of mouth going regarding my breakup consulting business and to get some feedback about what i could improve in the actual product
he said he still wants to be with me and he is sorry for breaking and going back to comfortable choice
do not contact him i had a missed call from him saturday but i am not calling back when leaving just leave if a guy loves you he will find a way if he does not why should you
when i asked him how he sees himself in 5 or 10 years he says maybe death but still i thought i was getting over this girl but just seeing her face fucking killed me
for a long time after you called the engagement off i isolated myself from family and my friend it was because i had hope and i knew you were giving me some sign to have that
i really want to just walk away and leave all this shit behind mei just keep getting these random thoughts through the day and cry my eyes out it hurts so much
then we would just would hug and lay there until you felt better that one hurts the most because i want to be there for you to take the pain away
so i am uncomfortable when they arrive it is just exhausting to think about stupid stuff that has little to no meaning to me
i know i am not a sociopath i can still feel sadness and if i focus on it i can feel everything else
i will be discussing my struggles with not being able to eat and i absolutely do not want to trigger anybody please if you think that reading someone is struggles with not being able to eat will trigger you sit this one out
she would get a laptop for me and i would literally play computer games while she did her own stuff and we would chat about random stuff occasionally
very heavy and toxic negative conditioning from the early childhood from a parent whom i love dearly am grateful to but who was perpetually alone and in some emotional disarray and chronic unhappiness check
i know you said you have thought about our break ups for weeks i am working on it like a dog i believed her each time
i mean nothing to this world so why even stay here no one gives a fuck about me not even my own family
these are all thoughts that terrify me because i genuinely feel like it will happen one day where i have to defend myself
now we have broken up and while i do love him still a year later and i am closer to wanting to try again i find that he is going back to old habits
just like that my best friend who i can not even be friends with for the time being we have a no contact rule but i keep breaking it
i obviously want her back really bad i come from a very rich family and never really wanted for much but i was never genuinely happy
why cry when i was in hospital if they still act like this towards me i am going to kill myself soon because i am exhausted
and i am in bits i do not know what to do anymore i feel so alone and so much pain i can not even describe it
i am doing a surveyhttpsformsgleeafzf4ytvz48nguz8 on the social and psychological effects of the covid19 quarantine for my ap research capstone class i would appreciate it if you guys could fill it out
he does not think he has a problem but refuses to stop even though i have made it clear how awfully it affects me
people hurt you and it is not your fault the scars are simply a part of you and your tragedies do not define you
my family member decided to forego christmas gifts this year and i want to take the money i would have spent and donate it to a mental health charity or organization i am in the us and wanted to see what suggestions this subreddit may have for best places to donate
all my friends and my mother tell me it is better to stay at my current college but i am desperate to change at this point
we both went in half a couple months later i started talking to my parents about wanting to propose and everything
i think this is to cope with my crushing depression anxiety etc since my moms house was just across the beach i trespassed by jumping over the fence to get inside
i do not want my mom to be in trouble again she is a wonderful mom to my baby brother who needs her
the yearning i describe is not from a place of entitlement i may need love but i am not entitled to it and not somehow deserving of it it is just a need and i can exist with it unfulfilled though maybe not without my meds lol
but i feel like she is afraid of me being gay recently this summer i got offered to go and have trials to become a model
she said part of her reasoning was due to how she felt like i was not really interested in her she was adamant that i would just move onto someone else and be happier after we broke up
i was sometime using some shit amph for no sleep hashmarihuana for good jokes etc 7 months for nothing i really hate boys sometimes
it is almost as if he is reclaiming his own power and does not rely on me for his happiness or as a means to heal his wounds so i can really make my own decision and he can for himself as well
that means that we always embrace and follow the love we blindly believe it is ours even tho we ignored the major red flags that came out of them and i know you did ignore them
the general idea that i am a bad person or a psychopath very much associated with the second theme when i am in a lot of physical pain my mental health deteriorates
two days after he left i felt like something changedi have recently been able to start working on this goal because i got new a job
hello i am going to preface this by saying i know that what i did was wrong however i do believe i had no other choice
i have been dealing with a lot of guilt recently as i have matured as a person recently but sometimes i have trouble going to sleep or sometimes life just seems pointless and nothing matters anymore like today is literally christmas and i am about to build my first pc but i can not find the joy in it in these moments
a few weeks later we got together and started a relationshipi do not think i want to go on honestly i am just hurt
since starting treatment in june i have made a tremendous amount of progress in learning to cope with my wildcard brain
it is literally inescapable and has taken over my whole personality and destroyed my last relationship because she could not handle who i am because of it i have complex ptsd from 4 years of abuse that messed me up developmentally and yes i go to therapy about it i am just sick of people trying to tell me i can not do this when they do not have to suffer like me every day bc of this
sometimes you just happen to live a mediocre or isolated life with no chance of it getting betterlife simply just is not for everyone i am glad i understand this now
i am 20 years old but my live looking like the live of average adultstudyingworkingsleepinglonelly walksinstead people in my age have girlfriendcollegues that want to spend some time with them and also they partyingi am so depressed in my small lonely town for eldelry people
i am really scared for college admissions i know i am going to get rejected from everywhere i apply and i want to kill myself
i am always by myself it is not even a choice this would mostly happen at night with her the next day acting mostly as if nothing happened
he then proceeds to make fun of my suicide attempt that occured a month earlier that i am still trying to get over because of all of the drama and bullshit that i was trying to escape
any advice is appreciatednow observe all that is happening in those imagined domains the good and the bad the beautiful and the sinister
sorry for my shity englishyes tired of being alive but that does not have quite the same ring to it they never helped me all i ever wanted was a fucking hug when i was upset but no
in highschool i could make some friends though we were the rejects i think it was the best 3 years of my life funnily enough i cannot remember much of it but i feel happy every time i try to put my mind in that time we had our internal problems too so it did not last beyond that time
there is no better present than giving a hope that one can be happy despite it all to give such a hope to give such a gift one must have it
chronic loneliness is something that can plague even someone with a packed social calendar very involved in their communityactivities outside the house and with an ebullient personality
i am so afraid for my future because i do not know if i will truly get better and i know that throughout my life bad things will happen sometimes but i do not want to be so weak that i will break down each time something bad happens to me
and whatever i can handle that i keep putting off relapsing until i eventually do it but it sucks anytime i hit a milestone i feel like it is not a big deal
however i am so depressed because i miss her so much i miss everything about her i panicked and tried my hardest to stop him i desperately tried in hopes he would change his mind
i was so sad and frustrated but he keeps talking ft ig texting to me like we used to date and he still wants to hang out with me he becomes even more affectionate it is really hard for me to get over him when he talks to me affectionately all the time and i kind of started to feel that i was too naive to say it
i should have cheated on you i do not care when the going gets tough you need to offer your hand to people who need it the most
maybe its just a phase yet i always end up pushing people away by showing them a very morbid picture of my life
it is called familiar pain we would rather have familiar pain in our life rather than unfamiliar painand now i think i have this weird mild anxiety thing that i still can not comprehend
i barely have any motivation and i feel like i have cost myself brain damage because i am much slower in processing the things that happened around me and i can not pay attention for a long time
then he said he felt like no one cared about him and i told him i still loved him he said it does not feel like it
i am not in distress i practice radical acceptance it works but does not get rid of the blankness i just need advice on what to do when i get hit really hard with a wave of depression and just turn grey i have so much potential and i am just living worse than a washed up frat boy no offense to any current or previous frat boys but you know what i mean you know
i love having lots of space but i could never say no to her wanting to hangout every day i would push off homework assignments and other schoolwork if we had plans just so i could give her my undivided attention
this is where i found out about attachment styles and did a lot of internalizing and browsing to different forums but i still do not know how to handle conversation with an fa
and if i told anyone including my family they would just judge me they talk about how suicidal people are stupid all the time
i have been trying begging for two days to get my mom to say that she cares about me and wants me and she is refusing
nobody will be able to fill the void nobody can make you feel as good as it would be if you were talking to him
the first week i felt less anxious and relieved than i had been the last two months with her things felt like they were getting better and i enjoyed the time i had until this last saturday
i can not really explain it my birthday has been making me feel lonely for years now i am just tired i will stop now because i am getting uncomfortable
i remember reading this and completely thinking that i must be using those parts of my brain wrong and then researched the hell out of these parts of the brain and how they worked
now why should not you do any of these things when you are trying to rebuild your selfesteem well it is straightforward it hurts to be so alone ignored staying only home working
however right now we are going to focus on limiting beliefs these are the ones that make us act in negative ways and usually hold us back from achieving our grandest goals and desires to be even more specific we are going to focus on overcoming the two most prominent limiting beliefs people adopt when challenged with a breakup i am unworthy of love and i am a failure in love so let us get to work
doing all of this drinking and going out really broke me several older guys ended up taking advantage of me sexually
it is the way i was raised which i now know was a self perpetuating victimizing system that does not change how i feel though
it is only gotten worse for the last 20 yearsi can not fucking take it any more it never fucking stops and heroin is the only thing that helps
i am aware this post is going to upset some people and that my problem seems incredibly first world this is the middle of a pandemic and people are struggling massively
she is chosen the life of drugs and abuse from a man over her children it is caused me to develop true hatred for her
just would like someone to tell me if they can relate or have any good advice i feel like my life is such a lie and there is no end to the unhappiness
so what is the fucking pointi tried to get euthanasia thrice i am a lot bigger than her so when it went down
belonging to someone being supported and always held by someoneand no you never needed anyone else because they were enough for you and even more
it got worst not once did i ever bad mouth her to friends and people who knew us found out guess she was already fucking someone new within 3 weeks of the break up
i am posting this after waking up from one at 600 am where i come home from work to find that my girlfriend invited my friend over and cheated on me with him
days after i messaged her that perhaps it is our anxiety why we are like this i apologized to her for acting needy and clingy
like i will tell someone i really like you and i enjoy talking to you and then an hour later i will be like i do not want to talk to you anymore and then they question if i was lying when i said i liked them earlier
and i spend time reading things that is far away from any thoughts i have about love reading mysteries or anything that does not relate to anything love
i should have seen this coming since you did not seem that afraid of losing me thinking breakups happen all the time and assumed we would be friends again and laugh it off like nothing happened
hey there so i would like to ask if you have any tips for getting motivation i am university student and i have all my notes and stuff that i need for my exams but i guess i am going through a burn out if you can give me any advice i would greatly appreciate it
the other i know where the office was but i do not know her name so i have no idea if it is still the same office
i have been living a worthless life just a vessel for consumption i am 17 and i feel like i am living the twilight years of a life i never got to live i have no school no job no education past 14 you would be surprised how much i do not know
all in all i am trying to become a better personapologies this will probably be a long one to be honest i do not even know why i am writing this
i currently work 7 days per week and have been doing so since january this year i have got a full time job during the week and a part time job on the weekends
i suffer in my own head i suffer with the ghosts i tried so hard to run away from but never will be able to
or in other words you become a part of your partners identity and vice versa my body feels heavy sometimes and i just lay in bed wanting to sleep but it just does not happen
i would really appreciate it if you could answer my survey which will be useful for me to find out what could be helpful in reducing loneliness
everything is just so weird because i know i will not feel this way in a few hours i bought numbing cream and all i am waiting for is it to get here
heyy so i am 16 and female btw but anyway just like 10 minutes ago i was looking around my room and i have all this school stuff on my wall and loads of shit and i was looking around
i quit my job recently because the stress was so much and decided to take december off my bonus was good enough to pay my rent and bills till march so that was not a problem but staying at home was
i hid things from her like how much weed i smoked the amount of porn i watched and when i would see my friends including when two people i thought were my friends gave me too much acid
i can not just get over it whenever i cry i cry for a long time so it definitely takes me a while to get over it
i get out of bed to the bathroom and i start shivering i go back in my bedroom and sit on my bed
or maybe some of you will just be flippant assholes lol join the club faggot wow this is some shitty writing hahaha you are exaggerating shit to get sympathy from strangers on reddit get laid loser sad lol you should have just let the old slut grope you maybe you would finally get some pussy dipshit
hurt and also if they get mad they start to really talk heavily about your weaknesses and provocate you no matter if you have traumatic experiences
i have tried to get them to realize this but they will not listen i do not want to make them sad but they will only grieve for so long
he would still call me and ask me almost every day something like am i the best at so and so have you met someone better than me at xx and we would never talk about what is going on with me even when i started to have huge issues with my health
i am so done with this constant fight every single day i am tired of the fake smile i tried to put on through out these last two years i am tired of all the bullshit i put people through just so they get a silent fuck you from me i am a backstabbing piece of shit who dosnt deserve a damn thing from this world
we both fell for each other and then a month in well she has a boyfriend they were on a break
if you are silent about how you feel speak up or look for things to make you happy like hobbies or listening to music something you would enjoy
some people in this industry quite a few in fact are like someone who brings a hammer set to examine and fix hardware such as cpu and graphic card and their way diagnosing problems is more like a set of labelled boxes that say from which side should they swing the hammer
hard time completing basic tasks like cleaning cooking etcshort attention span for anything that i am not extremely interested in it is a real struggle to identify what is what it is confusing
my emotions control me more than i would like to admit i never had someone to vent to and it feels like i am alone even when i am around people
because of it i feel insecure as fuck but eventhough like 3 months ago i felt the best i could ever feel i started going to the gym in august and making good progress but i feel like shit now and i have not been for 2 weeks now too which is a bad thing
i just feels like i am surrounded by darkness and in each hands i have a torch but one of the torch disappeared and i only have one torch left which represents my friends that society consider as bad people
i do not regret treating you to the best of my ability i do not regret loving you i do not regret giving you my heart but i do regret letting you play and toy with it for so long until you decided to break it a part of me hopes you come back someday but a part of me hopes you do not because i know my soft spot for will take control of my actions
i get cold today so that i do not have the energy to write good sentencer if you are reading this i just want to say that i love you
i just need to know how to cope and how to help him i do not really know what is going to happen anymore i feel like he will not stop until he succeeds
i have also had the realization that if i had a relationship and it was toxic i totally would not have seen the warning signs or that the person was toxic at all and i am grateful i have never been in a romantic relationship but also terrified and sad that someone could have so much power over me but i would be unable to see through that
i will not say that you should forgive them and be friends with them just to keep in touch with them unless and until you are completely healed please never consider to going back to friends take some time out
the reason i know i am a shitty boyfriend too is i do not know how to help well i do but i can not do so without feeling so fucking bad
we know that no individual or system is perfect mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people and we have enormous sympathy for them
when i finally did instead of enjoyment happiness satisfaction fulfillment joy i wanted to fucking kill myself i never thought we would be one of those stories and here we are
my parents are also immigrants and we live in a town that is not very diverse kids at my high school were mean and bullied me literally because of my family situation
this time when she asked what was wrong out of no where i freaking lied i told her a family member died and i just could not handle it today
when in a bed at night my reality says what the fuck are you doing in your lifeif you had to describe loneliness as a symptom what would you say it feels like in your body
i am not trying to plug or advertise as this is impossible without the help of you all i would love to make this film possible
it is been 9 years since she left and 5 years since i last saw her the song is about romeo and juliet running away from their homes parents etc
i warned him when he told me he loved me please do not hurt me keep it real i am not sure my heart could take another breaking i was celibate 7 yrs when we met
so does mental illness not discriminate can it happen to anyone at any time and do i even have the right to blame my parents for not noticing several subtle signs of mental health problems do the parents have a role in this
stay strong out there everyone keep your head up no matter how hard it gets and always remember time heals all wounds
that is why i even bother to write here right now even though i know i am a shitty writer and most people will not even make it this far into my post
quite literally nothing changed in this area of my life my social skills ability to relax and carry myself naturally with some style and dignity and healthy confidence and ability to just express myself and have fun in conversations all of these improved drastically i did have interactions i did go out for a beer gym etc every now and then
i can not get sad i can not get scared i am not even that happy but it is not just that i can not pay attention at all and my memory is extremely bad
he told me how no girl can come close to comparing to me asks me if when i am done with school i would move to his town
i am most likely going to be ok my dark moments are interlaced with more rational moments of lucidity but sometimes i take time to surprise her by going home etc suddenly she ask for breakup
he came back in october stating he had regrets and that it was not my fault at all but i was already involved with someone else by then
i just loved them and he said he loved me too but they felt that they needed to explore on their own
there is nothing happening to me it is just this cycle of checking my phone eating falling asleep and then checking my phone again
if i am miserable through christmas to new years eve i am going to give up because this is supposedly most wonderful time of the year if this is the best i have got coming then it is time to move on that is what i want for my shitty life i just want it over
because i thought i would be dead by 16 i did not exactly plan for 22 but nothings changed except i graduated but no ceremony because of covid which makes it feel very underwhelming
she said she did not know and that she was actually really done with everything the problems with my brother my father my sister she was done with it all
when you are not anxious write down everything that might make you anxious in the future and then write down what a good plan is to do when whatever causes you anxiety happens
i have mainly been looking after my little sister in the break as my mums really busy with work and my dad hurt himself but all of my old school friends are studying a whole lot and doing stuff like designing and making dresses
my vision is always somewhat moving and colorful there is always a rainbow static aura around everything ever since my life has gone downhill
i did not have this probleme before because i had internship and courses in the uny but now every thing is online
as i was just now putting santas stuff out it really hit me she is not here with me instead she is alone in psych ward on christmas
i do not know what to do anymore this pain i have been feeling has been going on since my childhood and i am at the breaking point
pretty soon i will have no professional commitments i am not in a serious relationship etc so it feels like the perfect time to move on from life
i have dealt with so many situations where i flirt with someone they like me then they just find someone else and tell me they want to stay friends and tell me how much they love me before leaving
i hope men use her for sex and treat her like dogshit and she realizes that i was amazing to her and how special it really was that a man was willing to step up and raise her daughter as his own and i hope to god she figures out that a man like that is rare and she comes crawling back so i can return her the ugly shame of having seen her pour her heart out to me only to know i read it and had no fucking decency to even respond back
i have only really been given help by one person while was the girl that slept in my bed with me mentioned in the before paragraph
his patience is running thin i know it everything hurts my head hurts my chest hurts and i can not stop crying i am selfish i know but i do not want anyone else
so i just stay in my room and play games and smoke weed as i can not listen to my thoughts for too long as i start to fall into an overthinking pit which i can not escape from
i have learned in life some people are not meant to be happy if i die people in my life will be better off
he is just absolutely fucking perfect and it can never be his fucking fault to him i am just a spoiled entitled brat that can never measure up
but my reply was never responded to i never got closure it made me incredibly anxious and i am actually lining up therapy
i stop for a while after writing a last extremely personal email to her workmail that gets forwarded to her coworkers we are 9 months later and i still think about it all the time
i could go a whole day and no one would talk to me unless they need something from me i should not be annoyed cuz i feel like i do talk to them when i need to feel less lonely
i do not know what to do i am struggling to stay motivated to talk with her she keeps making me listen to this stuff she will text me and basically just keep saying line after line what she wants she will give this whole plan breaking it up like bullet points and i just do not know what to do
i just ride each emotion as it comes if i am sad i will be sad but if something funny happens on tv i will allow myself to laugh instead of staying in the sad
this leads to me having to take care of my brother with a full university course load being alone scares the f out of me
i used to be against psych meds when they were recommended to me in high school i thought it would mess with my brain chemistry and was not for me
ik he is not going to remember this monday bc y would he it is not like i matter to him anymore he does not love me like i love him i feel like at one point he rlly liked me and then somewhere along the line he just stopped caring about me and i am just waiting for the day he throws me away and never speaks to me
repeatedly telling her that that is why i do not want to come to her house she repeatedly says that it is actually just because my dad turned me against her and throws a fit every time i do not go to her house which i have not gone to her house for quite a while now
sounds like a problem of the privileged typing this out given the many hurdles that several milllions have atled through in the past months and i do thoroughly acknowledge it
i did not put in enough effort they carried our love on their shoulders like a burden and that is probably why i am here now
i am reminded that i have always felt lonely but each bout of loneliness feels worse than the last one even more so i am reminded that i caused this loneliness myself
i 21 made a dream last night a really bad one with that sad feeling i think its because i cried before sleeping its rare that i do that in this dream people were annoying me i was angry and i did not want anyone to touch me but of course everyone did to bother me and make me lose my sanity in the second part of my dream i was lost everyone left i was still angry and hurt from that first part of the dream now everyone abandoned me i was lost in a big shop that sells useless stuff and whenever i find someone they find a way to leave me for other people
he met a girl that lived much closer only 20 min away instead of 22 hoursmy heart goes out to you all be gentle with yourselves please 3
this life is starting to suffocate me every waking moment every second feels like suffocating slowly desperate to come up for air
i believe core values are essential to overcoming adversity do not have any ask yourself what are you here for what are you fighting for what will you do with the time you are given what is your purpose
i am still indecisive and i want to keep distance but it does not mean i will or will not take him back that being said it feels like taking him back could be an option one day
the whole world is but that has only increased my anxiety i never thought that at this stage i would still be all by myself
and i refuse to change anymore to fit the mold that the world has and the minds of guys these days
i am a 30 year old male i am not sure if i have a problem or not right now i have a bmi of 20 down from about 26 i definitely have body image issues what i imagine as my ideal build would definitely be very underweight if i actually managed it the point is i am a healthy weight now
anyways i got asked on a date 1 week after we broke up from a stranger i met organically is it too soon to go on a date i am afraid i might miss out on an opportunity if i turn someone down that i would like to get to know a little better i am definitely not trying to hop back into a relationship already
would it be a better solution to stay away from relationship i do not want to stop fighting for the people i love and cherish
my mom was diagnosed with covid which i have been terrified of her getting this entire year i had the same mood my sister said some pretty depressing things i am extremely overprotective over her same mood my grandma kept making fun of the way i talk same mood
i can not stop thinking about him lately i feel angry sometimes sometimes bitter sometimes nostalgic looking back on the time we spent a lot of times depressed i keep rereading our last convo which has been almost a month ago it was the last thing he said to me before i started no contact to clear my head
these past few years i have been in a downward spiral in regards to my mental health i am not sure how to handle much of anything anymore between random urges to get drunkhigh on anything ptsd flashbacks days of awful draining depression and panic attacks i do not even have control of my life anymore
later on my parents have a conversation with my brother and i they talk to us about how lucky we are and that we should be grateful
it is not even 2 months that we broke up to make it harder we have to see each other constantly for work reasons
so imagine the level of involvement i sang this girl to sleep most nights nevertheless i could not be as open as i wanted to be i was still shy in my college days
and though i do have some friends i can talk to it is never consistent and i feel like in 10 years we are just going to be more separated than together
i deserve to die i do not even need to be suicidal i just need to carry out justice he was my best friend and now i just feel completely empty
i was wondering if you had any tips in having a more two sided conversation where she speaks her mind without it becoming an interview thanks3
now we are in the same class but i do not know how i can face him after quarantine ends it is driving me up the wall and i want it to go away
i am whole on my own i started picturing myself doing mundane things blissfully and alone are there times when i am happy sure but i am an unhappy person
does this fit me you have to ask do your thoughts fit you right does your thoughts fit the future you want to create that is the question you have to ask yourself
this boy in my class has a crush on me he talked to me for a bit in october and i made it obvious i was not interested he kind of sexualized me but i miss the attention it made me feel gross and anxious but at least somebody caredwanted me
it was the healthiest relationship i could ever ask forthe second i held my little girl soothing her as a mother would
maybe i will schedule a message to send after i am gone so that if something happens and it does not work i can cancel it
i have read through a lot of these posts and can relate to so many of them some days loneliness is worse than others
today for some reason has been especially hard i have never felt so alone and just cried so much in my life
plus she also has bipolar disorder and so she would just roller coaster me with emotions but i was hopeful that my 10 year experience with my ex wife had me well prepared for that
i am not sure how to describe it okay so like imagine a sort of number line type thing 0 is sad and 100 is happy i am 60 no matter what i am always 60
i just feel good and confident and i know that if i will ever be with someone it is going to be someone damn special
i just want a break from life i feel like i am going to snap on everyone and i just feel so low and angry all the time
i really thought with all my heart that she was the one that we would love each other no matter what except from like a betrayal
do not let them take your heart do not be reckless always have respect for the power they have always remember who you are and always remember the people who are worthy of your love
have i done all there is to do should i leave it at that should i reach out again and wish him a happy new year will it turn into something toxic and draining for the both of us will i get hurt even more i feel how i never want to open up to anyone ever again
i do not know how to describe but i can say that i have a lot of things to do and i end up doing nothing
i recently had one of these episodes i totally lost myself not physical just verbally abusive and angry this led to depression sadness anger and all sorts of emotions
there is another reason holidays are hell my fat ass gets dragged into eating it so that my family thinks that i am okay
now the dog had peed on the blanket and it needed to get washed i will answer any questions as best as i can
i do not want to see her or see her social media or anything but if i block her then i seem rude but i still want to go onto social media i hate this feeling i feel like dying at this point
i am alone as in completely i have no friends what so ever i just feel emptyright now being in my room feels different i feel like i am suffocating
just he robbed me of my high school years even though we barely talked i was still obsessed i miss you i miss my best friend so so much
i am on medication but can not get a doctors appointment until next year to change my meds as they admittedly are not the best for me
just looking to see if anyone has been through anything similar and a word of advice i broke up with my ex nearly 5 month ago
i had to call emergency services to take him away for the last time i spent the last few months alone at their home packing all their belongings
ever since my brother was taken away this family is nothing but a she will of what it used to and could have been
literally nothing makes me happy anymore all i do is spend almost all of almost every day in bed crying while watching streams
wow i have the worst fucking luck first i test positive with covid today and now i am in the er because i got shocked trying to clean a light switch with a disenfectant wipe i am literally sobbing in the er terrified of what is going to happen
i personally am hurting because everyone here thinks that being the dumper makes you the bad guy while i did choose to break up with my ex does not mean i am not hurting too
one is a positive and empowering voice who gives out compliments and good ideas all the time every time and is a very nurturing mind
i realize how selfish i sound but it is true i just want him to live a long life and be happy
i spend days just sitting around crying i self harm i find little joy in anything around me if i were able i would drink myself to incapacity or something similar
i am tired of seeing kids happy on christmas while my daughter is out of it not knowing how to rip open a present
have you ever gotten a vibe like this when have you been warned out of the blue that something was seriously wrong with your relationship
i want the pain to end i want my old life back i want a do over i want her i want to live with my daughters again
i mean obviously deep down i still have some feelings but she is so mean to me its made moving on easier
i would go out to get food or drinks whenever people were up for it but now i do none of those things
i know they are not going to turn up to dinner on time i thought it was getting better but now it feels like just yesterday she broke me
i am always afraid of being happy or proud of myself because i know i would not do good later on and then i would be sad again
i am sorry this my situation seems really confusing but if there is any advice or stories please fill free to share
i was harassed daily every week when i would change in gym class i was groped by the surface of my breasts
some people tell me i should not give up and just keep knocking at every door well you stupid fucks that is exactly what i would do
i am trying to accept that there is no going back trying to remind myself it was not my fault and she is been one hell of a woman
she was the closest i ever felt to someone and was not someone i just saw at school 5 times a week
i have so many friends who have been in 5 year relationships and that also makes me sad that i will never have one ik i will be ending things before i turn 24 but it still hurts my heart good thing it will not be beating much longer
where can i find someone i would be able to spend hours talking withsoulmate i just feel i am not good enough of a social being
i am 13 about 46 years ago i wrote letters about what it would be like to kill myslef and wrote notes about my attempts
i know you said you would take full responsibility for us ending but i guess i am hurting because i wanted it so much
everyone thought i was going to be some fucking doctor or lawyer and they saw such potential and it is so fucking irritating
i think it is extremely likely i have bpd from what i know from other diagnosed people and from what i have read it just sounds exacly like me i have never resonated to anything so much and it scares me
i have never felt this kind of loss before i do not want to be anywhere or do anything or see anyone or eat or smell
i had a helper who helped pick me up from school and kept me company eventually i treated her as my sister
the weird thing is that i do not think anything is out to get me or watching me or anything the thought is ridiculous but the fear is so real as to have become somewhat debilitating when i close my eyes i see the innocuous images from the videos and it jolts me back awake this has never happened before and it is very confusing and concerning right now
i have learned a lot about myself as a person i came in because of major depression and maybe had a little od attempt the night prior but now i know that i suffer from anxiety am neurodiverse slightly on the autism spectrum have an eating disorder arfid might not be depressed at all but rather have a rare type of epilepsy that causes my mental breakdowns and fast changing emotions
she hid her emotions from me and would always make no effort to try to talk call or figure out when we can see each other again
it is just i go back and forth so much i genuinely have no idea what emotion is how i really feel and what emotion is my brain fucking with me
she is so beautiful but she seems so distant now like someone i have never met before i know i should not be stalking her social media but its hard not to
i had a gut feeling he liked his girl best friend he was overly flirty with her and was constantly talking to her i told him if you like her please tell me so we can break up if you want to date her please tell me so i can move on he always denied it and called me crazy said i was delusional
i do not what it is to feel like myself either because i do not know who i am i do not know if something is how i actually am or just what my mental illness has made me
according to my friends he is already been posting up somewhat suggestive pics on insta i actually really did not want to know
i need people to talk to i cut off all my friends they are good people i am just not used to having friends idk if i can handle it i also do not want to bother them all the time talking about suicide
i am a like a hair close to completely losing it and obliterating my head so i do not have to deal with anyones shit
so i do not want to go in great detail about this because frankly there is a lot of sexual trauma and grooming that has happened to me sadly however i just want some kind of advice
i do not want to hurt my friends and family and i just want him to be happy but maybe space is what he really needs right now
i usually have a lot going on in my brain but i have never had this many anxiety attacks about the same problem
my life has been pretty difficult lately i mean everyone elses has been too i struggle with a chronic health condition that is also reeking havoc on my selfesteem i m struggling with unresolved trauma and i bottle up all of my damn feelings until they rupture like this
it is very hard living with distrust like this and i have not felt normal in a long time i do not know what to do here to help myself
i posted the chime because of how suicidal i was feeling because at that moment i realized that i could not stand to see the face of my rapist every single day at work
3 the thoughts since then have changed a lot but always in 3 big themes the general idea that i am a bad person or a psychopath very much associated with the second theme
i did not want our last meeting to be a goodbye i wanted it to be welcome back i missed you so much
you probably realized at some point that a other people can have much more significant and painful problems than you and b that a lot of guys are struggling with the identical issues you are going through
my manger noticed and i asked if i could take my 15 minute break earlier when she asked what was wrong at first i told her i did not feel good
now i am still feeling the effects of the vyvance basically doctorprescribed amphetamines i take for my add so a slightly manic state kind of ensued
fast forward to now friends do not communicate with me at all they never told me why they decided to stop communication they are all still close and each of them have gotten married and are starting to have kids all of them went to each others weddings and baby showers i was left out of all of it
hey i am just a teenager but i feel like i am already done with life if this is supposed to be the time of my life then i just want it to be over i am tired of crying every night until my face literally hurts
i was scared of losing her and tried to open up new ways in the relationship so i could be closer to her
i asked her to come home and told her i was tired if fighting over small things we agreed to eat pizza and watch netflix and cuddle up
make sure they are for the best you do not deserve to be broken nobody does not even thembecause a broken heart is far more painful that a broken bone or a wounded one
i loved her with all heart and it was all going fine until i fucked it all up the physical effects it had on me was for the lack of a better word draining
be me age 5 my parents are divorce and remarried only have 1 biological sister father adopted my stepsisters and paid more attention to them and his wife mother had two kids with stepfather and paid more attention to the kids she had with him never felt like i had a home
i am on instagram as theopenheart2020 install the app to follow my photos and videos httpswwwinstagramcominvitescontactitdozuiyw1nxautm_contentihm5zcbreally dramatic title but i was wondering if anyones felt this weird feeling i have noticed
why not just stay here and i told her i wanted to help out she did not seem very pleased but we left the house together
of course some of the ache is still there he was my first love i have been shamed for that since kindergarten i have lost and gained so much weight in my life
i hate that i am troubling those close to me just so i can feel solace i think my inner circle is getting further away from me maybe because of my condition
and i know the sooner i expect things the happier i will be but i have decided to try reaching out to my friend that i lost one last time
few weeks ago my boyfriend ended the relationship it was difficult but not that much of an issue i was feeling lonely in the relationship and nothing really changed for me
and the cherry on the cake is that there is another girl from the same app lol that i have been talking to that really likes me
i was so lonely i locked myself out of the room went to the hotel reception5 start hotel so preety good customer service and told them that it is my bday and i was receiving a lot of calls and so i went out to lobby to talk since to not awake my colleague since he was asleep and locked myself out did not ring the bell so as to not awaken him and asked them for a duplicate key to go back to the room the receptionist had somehow sawn me 2 hrs sitting alone in the lobby and knew i was lying however she wished me happy birthday and gave me a duplicate key
and my mom is like uh what the hellbut now i am crying and am completely broken to my soul i made my dad feel this
the adhd medication helped with focus but made it impossible to do tasks because my emotions were even more intense and i made me sensitive
your whole day is messed up morning and nights are the sameyou decide then to go out see your friends have fun
i have struggles with anorexia and bulimia and the best advice i got is that no one can help you but yourself
but that is all people tell me to do run to places that can not help me and be blissfully happy for used clothes carbohydrate laden food handouts that i can not eat and enjoy poverty existence
every breathe of every day feels like another reason to kill myself i am stocked up on everything that i will take to end my life
i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder earlier this year and i believe this is the case for me because i can never draw any distinction between relaxed or normal me although i never really feel completely relaxed and anxious me
but what is so weird is that i do not feel sad at all because i just know it is not the end i have this gut feeling knowing that after the quarantine ends in 1 week everything will be fine
like today i was in the middle of a conversation at work and suddenly felt one of my lymph nodes under my jaw and convinced myself it was swollen
i usually take it day by day but somedays the smallest things break me like today i started the day as positively as i could
after that i was on a little 10 inch laptop some of the stickers on the front were peeling and looked unsightly but i could not get all the adhesive off i applied some acetone to weaken the glue and it also melted the keyboard
sadness and depression two emotions that i am basically forced to feel because no one truthfully loves me i can never keep an emotion if you want to be friends then please let me know or if you want to attempt to make me feel better then comment with this emoji thank you for reading this
has anyone been in a long term depression like myself that truly got better that found happiness againbetween the multitude of therapists i have gone through and all the cocktails of pills i have tried
enter my name i have been thinking a lot and i am still conflicted about our relationship i end up hanging up the phone
she became unbearable the fights between everyone made it hard to bear people are only there when they need something i am expendable for them
about how everything might just be a simulation playing out in my dying mind about how nothing makes sense and that the world was created to drive you insane
i can not eat can not sleep or think straight her goal is me out of my dads life and she will not stop i am just tired
his apartment is not very sturdy so i practically hear quick footsteps coming down the stairs after i have been talking with him for a minute so he obviously had a girl over
i have been so subconsciously angry that i do not have anyone to be angry at that when my only source of love that i had did hurt me on purpose i just projected everything that is ever happened to me onto her the target i felt okay with hating
life has not been easy for them so i get why they are feeling this way they come from a culture where mental health is not really recognized and is made to feel as if they are responsible for their suffering there is next to no support at home i try to help in any way i can emotional support physical support listen to their rants regularly checking in etc
like he might be telling the truth and i am an asshole who never trust anyone or my feeling might be true and he is up to some gigantic bullsht the thing is he always told but never actually shown anything that could barely match his words like idk he want to make his character more interesting
i know i can not have a new relationship just 5 days after my breakup and i do not want this to be a rebound relationship either
i am suffocating like i need to breathe again not physically but that is months from now and i am not sure how i can cope with living here honestly
i fear that by telling john my true feelings he will hurt himself or someone else he is mentioned a past flame hurting him and it clearly has had an impact on him because i am the only other person he is been interested in and the friendship and trust i have put in him will be ruined
i started to shake and internally panic causing me to leap out of my bed and stand on the middle of my hallway still shaking
hey guys i had a lot of problems to overcome in my social life for the last years i was very lonely because i had not the like minded friends and the relationship i was looking for in my life now as i got that problem handled i love my new life and i ask myself
i am in a particular pickle pain in my pelvis doctors think it is a hernia that kills me when i standwalk so i had to quit my job and have been waiting for a ct scan since october with no painkillers no income in my sisters basement
i am on the verge of insanity not sure if its the right term bc every time i look at my future as a pharmacist in my country i find it bleak as ash
and for what i used to think i was helping people by trying to talk to them be their friend and that suicidal thoughts could be taken away
very stupid question i know because almost everyone experience breakup one day and survive it even if it takes time but i genuinely want to know
i am just done with it all i am already doing all i possibly can to stay alive and to change but it barely slows the decay
these holidays are different because i can not share anything with him i am still in my bed right now and i just do not want to get out some days i am happy and everything is okay but today is a bad day i can feel it i do not know what to do right now
i feel like my mind is degrading and i have lost capability to think correctly i do not know what is wrong with me but it makes me sick of living
she did not answer it she said one of her siblings and her dad does not like me no one will ever want me i will always be a rebound
and it leaves me feeling like shit i can not help feeling like i have no fucking control over anything right now including this stupid relationship
it is affecting me aswell i am feel so tired and depressed all the time and making me suicidal as well that i should not exist or that i am the main problem in the situation
after the hospital i went straight to custody again and then transferred to the court a temporary restriction order was placed and have to appear to the court again february first no bond was charged
i just want the ability to connect with someonesomething i have not found it at all i am unsure i will ever find it
i just randomly started crying and did not understand why finally i stopped crying when my mom called all of us to come eat
yet the entire time he was crying and telling me he loved me i had to walk away eventually i hate that i let this person have so much power that i rewarded his behavior towards me
come my junior year of high school i saw her one day and decided to ask her to hang out with me
but we also had this connection and wanted more we seemed to genuinely like each other and agreed to try for a relationship
we were really good friends for a year before we confessed our feelings to each other our talking stage was really good
my question is if it is safe for me to consume it 3 times a month or am i in risk of anything they prescribed me 15 mg pills and i usually just take a small bite out of the pill which could be around 5mg
today is christmas and my brother was mad at god knows what so he has kicked me in the back i screamed in pain unable to move and no one came he just stayed there laughing at me
i say really abusive things like it makes me happy thinking of him with an eating disorder or if a guy seems particularly nice and congenial i imply that it is just a front and that they are really just vain mean people in reality
my boyfriend is a few months younger than i am and i know for certain that we are not at the maturity level to move in together both legally and mentally
she said that she does not believe me when i say i love you and that i am still not open to her about my issues
i know the best thing for me to do is to cut contact at least for now if he comes back then we can have the discussion but god i am just so confused
i desperately want a life worth living but i am starting to accept that it is not going to happentalking about the most important lesson in life i love this one such a personality and such an energy
idk what sub to post this on but i chose this one so basically i always feel like someone is watching me
i did not tell anybody instead i overdosed sleeping pills at school i could not find one of the gift cards i bought my son
i know that if someone truly loves you they will believe that the slightest move you do for them is enough they will make the world out of just seeing your face or holding your hand
i can not remember the last time i felt genuine happiness i have not in so long i look back and just see pain
happy thinking about all the good times and laughs we had sad because i miss them and wish they could have continued
hi all i am going through a really bad phase in life and i would love to hear some thought on how i can move on and be a better person
we have to make due with what we have got i can not rely on people to hold my hand for my whole life
i wish i was into writing at least there is not much i do every day other than think and think and think it is frustrating not to be able to get them out one of the worst things that can happen to you is to be surrounded by wrong kind of peopleand that is an understatement
i thought this would only work for little kids but seems some adults even like it it is highly customizable and you can get your whole family on the account if you like
in general beliefs are nothing more than thoughts we have confidence in that were formed from negative or positive experiences they are our perceptions about what we feel is right and wrong true or false and can keep us stuck or help us progress they shape our reality they dictate our behaviors and guide us in making future decisions but are not facts like we often assume even though they sometimes feel and seem real
i set my whole life on fire and am basically throwing gasoline on it note it sucks that i can not reach out to my therapist because naturally she is with her family
i have learned to be enough for myself and hug myself when i am down it is okay to cry and do not feel bad for feeling bad
that has changed over the last few weeks i am gradually feeling worse and worse and i have decided i am making another attempt tonight i have had a great christmas and i have been able to see my family but i am too tired now i have had enough
by then i was mature and experienced enough to realize the significance of sitting at the front row however i was not responsive or interactive whatsoever
i f 19 malaysian have never seeked for a professional opinion about this but i have developed this habit of lying about my illness because i am too scared of receiving a little bit less attention from someone i cared
i want to be fucking dead i have been through some serious shit since she sent the first message but i doubt she would get it
during my school days i used to be a popular sort of guy because i would crack jokes and also i was very good at studies and i did have some close friends but with time i realised that they are no longer interested in maintaining the friendship i was always the one who used to message them first asking about how they are what they are etc
i do not even know how to express this to anyone because it is the same response oh i am so sorry i know it is hard but your strong blah blah blah
turn to be only me who still trying to send her good night text but its obviously she did not care anymore
i apologized and i do not even know how asked them man sometimes life is hard do not you think what would you do if this was your last day one of them said it is but please do not pressurize yourself
they are not suffering as much as you are unless they truly love you and then did their everything to get you back but that is another scenario
these last days i can not focus i keep hearing those music tracks sounds and voices talkingto focus i need to put on some binaural beats
i asked people for help or encouragement or whatever i should call it they decided to tell my little sister about what i was doing and where i was headed
i love him to every pieces of body and soul i have no contact with her at all because it was just a random match
cheated on me about 3 weeks ago and we went through an agonizing 2 or so weeks forgiving and getting better somehow and she did it again 3 days ago
pain is my enemyall of my ideas hopes and dreams still ideas hopes and dreams and never fulfilled nor will they be
i feel like all of those bad events situations have built up inside of me i feel so so drained tired hopeless what do you do in situations like this how can i let go of these things and move on relax
how many times have you experienced that that when you have finally broken up with someone you break up them or they break up with you your mind is like but it could have been this it was so beautiful i remember when we went out to this place
they are mostly whispers but sometimes they tell her to kill herself or tell her how much of a mistake she is is what she told me
again i asked my friend if i could leave but she said she was not going to leave at that time and i was not abandoning her with three guys late at night
almost a month ago my ex fiancégirlfriend of almost 4 years broke up with me a week before i was supposed to fly to see her in another country
i have crazy attachment issues and mommy issues which of course have a effect on all of my relationships i get super attached and never want to lose whomever no matter how shit they are
not once she did ever say they were sleeping together and she chose to lie about it i tried to forgive after a few days but i simply could not
i never really thought of it as a choice to estrange myself from most of them but maybe it is i just went with what i feel is true in the deepest humane and spiritual way possible i can not fathom pretending to be what i am not with my extended family it causes great moral pain inside
i had a talk with my doctor last month about my depression and anxiety he said human were designed for this type of isolation
i am angry at a lot of different things i am about doneevery morning when i wake up i feel like giving up
i take meds it just is not enough either during exam i could not get my thoughts and ideas together and write the exam
if you could sit down with your ex what would you say talk aboutso i have decided to document my healing to reflect and get things off my chest
he does not know if he loves me anymore i want to try again but he does not not here not anywhere all these 5 years i do not love you
i want to move on but idk if i should be taking my time with grief instead of getting all excited for a new girl
it is like merely existing is not even pleasurable so i get back on my phone but again it is not pleasurable i feel stuck in this loop of restlessness
i was seriously going to propose this week how can somebody be so crueli still feel incredibly guilty about calling the police though which i should
and also my dumbass self threw my fucking couch away so i literally have no where to even lay down and rest now
until yesterday when he texted me that he was with her and as soon as i saw that it is like i went back to square one
i am a little worried because after asking a few friends it is only me who feels disgusted to the point of feeling nauseous when i think about whatever i ate earlier in the day i do not think i am prone to developing an ed but it is starting to get a little concerning
thank you so much for reading this chapter my wife is currently in the process of divorcing me he said i know
just another friend at work i thought was cute but then 3 months ago she reaches out to me and starts flirting with me
maybe it is that i am scared for people to know me i am not sure this affects all parts of my life but it hits my relationship the hardest
it makes you more beautiful attractive powerful and strong it does not break you it makes you stronger my dad was still at my grandparents house and he was going to text us when my uncle left
i have always had to put my parents and my siblings needs before mine which is fine to an extent but its gone too far
i knew that our marriage would not be easy but if i did not say yes he would never propose again and if i did not sign the papers i would have to deal with the disappointment from my family i could not risk either of those things i was already tired now i am exhausted
i am usually amazing at spelling but lately i have struggled to type simple words like pair and write people respect consistency for me it was to improve my german
i will never fit in anywhere i go it was a whirlwind relationship we clicked right away and the chemistry was crazy intense
would pull my pants and underwear down to my knees while i was doing dishes and then walk away leaving me like that could be cute but i asked him to pull it back up and he would smile and walk away i felt like he had control over my body that i did not like
she said she is felt like we are growing apart for a while and she wants to be her own person i do not feel this at all
sorry for getting angry near the end but can someone please explain thishow is c po ugh syrup as a method out of curiosity
i have always been there for you and you always treated me as a second option why can not i be first for anyone i miss you i do i miss when you acted like you cared plz why can not we be okay why can not we just be fine i forgive you idc anymore plz just i miss your touch
at the time i never realised that this was not a pity party or that it was a way of saying how lucky you are while you were so insecure it was a sign that you knew what you were doing
i have no friends all ik is that i will pick myself up i want to sleep to never wake up
i went to the first place i found cheap ass crapy motel in the border of the city from my top floor city view downtown apartment to a place i did not know if the sheets were clean
last night was one of the most vivid dreams yet to say i got used to these spikes in happiness would be an understatement
how am i supposed to go on when you are my soulmate i feel so sick and disgusting and i do not know what to do
i felt happy with him an i thought he felt the same we planned an international trip july 2019 had a great time and felt compatible
even though i know there are others like me out there and it is comforting to know i am not alone it is very rare to meet them
another time probably a few years later me and two friends were over at a girls house she also had a friend with her someone wanted to play a kissing game and the girls both declared that they would only partake in it if i went home first so i did crying the whole way
i am tired of trying honestly i have done my very best for my family and friends but at some point it is unsustainable to live as a she will for others suffering as an empty ghost for god knows how many more years i am like a puppet dancing for other people but wooden and dead inside
i am more and more angry i can not stand anything anymore it is too much her effort was finally matched she said it is been awhile since she said stuff like that too
like starts folding the laundry and leaves it all over the living room so i still have to come and complete it and put it away
so you have no reason to chase or want someone with who things just did not work out once in 2011 after dropping out of college
i always felt people were gossiping about me because of this i paid too much attention to peoples behavior and obsessed about them my obsession over the years worsened to the point that i could no longer live a normal life i looked depressed and angry throughout this past 4 years of school
i have spent 4 years out of that abusive household and since then i put all of my focus on the big things that happened but lately i have become aware of the intricacies of how it is affected me
we broke up saturday and she posted her on snapchat last night the only way i knew is because a friend decided to tell me knowing i am still in love with her and trying to fight for our relationship
i had sex for the first time and it honestly does not feel like a big deal it was not a big deal when it happened and that feeling has not changed at all
since he told me that it is been bugging me since the day she messaged me the following day i messaged her telling her that i think it is best to part ways as it is not going to help my healing process my stupid ass really told her i still have not changed much for feelings wise when it comes to her she understood and told me she is not forcing me to be friends and said her goodbyes
i see everyone else hanging out with their besties and i just can not seem to find my people some days i just wish i no longer existed in this world
you know every time you say you wish you could give me a hug it hurts please stop please please please stop breadcrumbjng me please stop acting like i have a chance please please please stop
my anxiety got worse during quarantine i am anxious about many things the person i am in love with has all but made me feel that i should just do it
also i did celebrate my birthday with my family today eveningthey surprised me with that and i did have a few friends wish me too much later during the day lol i wrote that in the noon time because i was feeling super lonely i love every single one of you soo much you are all amazing
i am thirtyseven i have autism the supposed high functioning kind but that is a load of shit there is no such thing there is fucked and slightly less fucked
my cousin passed away and two people i went to school with passed the most recent one a few days ago to suicide
i want to kms after college because i am gay i am sure that i will probably die as a virgin who never even had a kiss because i did not meet any gay guy irl so far and honestly doubt that anyone would be with me
i know i am in danger but somehow i enjoy this painbitter taste in my throat deadly poison in my veins counting the seconds till i get insane
my mom is not a sweet person either she is not bad though it is just that she or does not love me or does not know how to demonstrate love
but i am ugly and being ugly is always going to take a toll on me i did not had other close relatives either neither near where we lived nor my age or close
they might put me on medication temporarily while i wait for camhs i have already been waiting for two monthsbut not even my best friend wants to answer my texts
his best friend is helping me move and his word touched me deep we would eat dirt for the woman we love and what is he doing right now
i am extremely toxic in relationships i have no social skills no motivation to do anything nothing i am good at or want to do nothing
as a teenager i was super selfconscious after getting cat called and followed a few times i became conscious of my body too
through mutual friends i found out they had been flirtatious and implicit with other people during the break i could not handle that so i took the initiative and dumped them
even though she treated me like shit i have forgiven herthis study has been approved by the institutional review board at the university of texas 2020040088
college a new chapter in my boring so far life has started and hopefully a better one we did she said she was following my life on twitter
now i do not have anyone to talk to and i spend time reading things that is far away from any thoughts i have about love
i have anxiety about religious things but have gotten so much better thankfully but i know it still lurks in my mind and then recently i have been having anxiety and mental intrusive thoughts about harming people which i know i would never do but it still gives me anxiety
j and i really hit it off like really hit it off what difference would it make if i was dead what
i am tired of longing for friendship that clearly people are willing to give tired of being the first to show and last to leave
i feel as though i have tried everything i have been suggested to cope and move on and nothing seems to be working
i came into the call kind of hopeful thinking we could try again even though we have tried before when the same issues came up but he was very reasonable and did not want to hurt me again or be in the same situation again in a few months and it made sense and i knew this all myself but i was absolutely devastated
hi just some background knowledge i had dumped my ex gf two months ago and we had ended on good terms in these two months on social media she is been passively aggressively targeting me by posting slutty pictures and ignorant statements of such i have now removed her off social media but she is starting to live rent free in my head how do i forget about her once and for all
but i could feel the throbbing pain of the slits on my wrists every time i did something it feels so long ago but the fresh mental wounds are still there
when i shouted za worldo she decided to throw everything around her at me knives a halo reach figure a monitor and she approached me and started beating on me
it is been a year since the day she told me she no longer loved me i am sure that she has dwelled on that for weeks until her future plans were certain
but any advice or just some outside perspective would really be appreciated thank you in advanced and i hope you are all healthy and safe and have a great holiday
i do not have anything else really that i have not found or made through him have any of you ever taken that leap and moved away did you find life improved
i just feel like pills take less effort i have been pretty lowfunctioning anyway probably why the thought of more physical methods still seem too tiring to actually do them
just can not stop thinking about suicide just want the pain to stop every time i awake i am disappointed that i am not dead
and the will to wake up the next day is still not availablei want to pull through for my unborn baby which is due soon
i finally felt like there were people i could relate to rather than just putting on this fake impression of relatability in life
i have been lying in bed for hours thoughts of suicide eating away at my mind just boring a hole right through me getting stronger louder the only thing keeping me alive at this point being the apathy i feel towards even getting up
but it hurts every morning to get out of bed and live i hate to leave like this but the pain is unbearable
we still text each other maybe once a day and it is usually just us making small talk since we agreed to be friends
i am a young man and am physically healthy but i feel like there is always something wrong with me physically i am never satisfied with my current physical state
i know this is not so tragic but after a pretty shitty year this is just the icing on the cake
i am a 21 yo male who have been sick from uc from 2018 meaning 3 years during this whole time i have been extremely sick and it has only gotten worse
talking about us hanging out and cuddling i was super confused and approached her about it and she went back again saying we are just friends
even then i do not feel super close to most of them and i known them for years am i outgrowing this friend group
it has been two weeks since the girl i thought was the one broke my heart the first week i felt less anxious and relieved than i had been the last two months with her
so i decided to build profund friendships but all the time i was focused on my work made me forget how to socialize
a few months ago when he broke my heart if you would have asked me what i would be doing today id have said crying and missing him
when i think about that night i feel happy there was no drugs no alcohol just three people talking and having deep conversation
a quality an attribute the way they spoke to you the way they treated you i want you to again be ascertaining to yourself that it was good that you broke up
mental health pro want to hospitalize me and i wander what your experience has beensome info 15 on suicidality on meds under a therapist and a psychiatrist and from israel
what a sad life i must live to be heading off to a surgery tomorrow and i have no one to accompany me it is a minor outpatient surgery but i am not allowed to drive after the procedure and i can not find anyone willing to drive me to and from the hospital i am so tired of being alone
i have already written my last message on my phone i hope my parents read it and feel guilty about what they have done to me
i have come to accept that i will either die before 18 or watch myself slowly decline into what i promised myself i would never be
i know this is not healthy but whenever i meet someone new that peaks my interest i can not help but over analyze and obsess over them day dreaming about them
i do not have much friends here needless to say i do not talk to anyone outside my family work these days
he said we are not compatible with each other he is too sensitive and i am too frank so i hurt his feelings from time to time
then there would be times where i would say i can not take it anymore and he constantly hurts me and he would beg for me to stay and bring me flowers and gifts and show up unannounced to my house
aces are adverse childhood experiences that harm childrens developing brains and lead to changing how they respond to stress and damaging their immune systems so profoundly that the effects show up decades later aces because much of our burden of chronic disease most mental illness and are at the root of most violence
the hardest part is coping with the fact that the girl i fell in love with seemingly did not even exist and that i never truly knew who this person really was despite spending 2 years with her
i have a boyfriend but he is had a relatively normal childhood so he can not relate to my struggles and i do not know who to talk about this other than my therapist
i ended up giving up completely on my failing relationship from my cheater gf and decided that new hope had sprung up within me to be loved the right way
i broke up with my boyfriend about four weeks ago we had been together for about nine months we met online and it was long distance
i go through mood swings quite frequently sometimes they are pretty bad suicidal thoughts sleeplessness i think it usually comes after a bad spell but can not be sure i am also wondering if cbd use only brought my attention to this or caused it
now it seems my efforts to stay in touch were toxic and another friend she bragged about getting rid of recently was too negative after leaving an abusive relationship and losing her parent one feature of being so lonely sometimes is that people i should not even talk to are my life rafts
i also got a dog because i thought he would be a great addition to my family but now i hate him so much
i am blaming this to recent eventsfactors company layoffs with my turn coming this month end some friends passed away one of them bade goodbye just this week
i do not necessarily feel that awkwardness when talking to a woman or another guy or girl online i honestly feel more comfortable talking about deep stuff including mental health issues with women especially online since i am extremely shy and socially awkward
so there is no way i can have no contact with him either and it just scares me that i would have to kind of completely stop talking to him altogether
2 it is like on a resume where you need experience to get a job but you can not get the experience without the job how do i improve i am decent looking and social able guy but i rather not just go out and have one night stands or even if i were how to even go about it
he accepted my physical shortcomings for being mtf trans loved mereflecting on it three years later there are multiple changes that affected me
i feel like throwing up i am just stuffing myself with food right now to somehow lessen my anxiety but i feel like i am going to regret this because yeah i feel nauseous
he talked about marrying me just a few months before our break up after 7 years i finally have the courage to really open up about my experience with major depressive disorder
the only way for me to find hope and peace at the moment is thinking that maybe somehow someday we are going to work this out
i never thought about that stuff at all so i do not know where that came fromwe were going to do it with our close on and it just happened
and make sure to tell my mom that i fucking hate herthere is not much holding me here anymore as horrible as it sounds
i keep trucking i keep telling myself it will be okay but i am exhaustedi have what many would call a great life
is it bad that i am now just accepting that i have mental problems i always thought i was strong enough to control it especially being african american i never really told my family because me overthinking oh they would not believe me so what the heck
so please please imagine your self as who you want to be imagine yourself as confident or happy or successful or adventurous or book smart or independent or any wonderful thing you want to be because even if you hold a different mindset for 15 seconds your neural pathways start to adapt to that new state
things are okay and we are talking again she had gone onto my facebook without my knowledge or my permission while on there she saw that i had explicit photos of one of my exs saved in my dms to myself
are just something that you control idk why i feel this way i want to get help i know i have been suffering from this but what if all those times and this time is just me faking it unconsciously i do not even know if i can talk about it verbally i just usually write it down because it does not feel real to me and i somehow feel ashamed
being heard means a lot to me i guess for everyone but some get that chance so when the man started to encourage me to keep talking even though i was sure it would be a lost call thirty minutes of crying and venting for the first time after made me change my mind i thanked him he said courage is to choose to live and i went to sleep
still i did what i could and tried to find a liking to it lots of robert johnson lately miles davis is my all time favorite he got me into jazz
i was never really told anything other than she is exhausted which while i am able to get a pretty good idea of what that means i really did not get a whole lot of an explanation
now why pain the thought that it would be an impossible dream being with the beloved within the circumstance of being near to each other yet can not talk to one another and being far from one another yet wanting to be near to one another is a curse in itself a burden one has to carry because of human nature
i keep thinking of that line from call me by your name spoken by elios fatherwe rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new
later i receive a call asking about that buddy i have not seen or heard from him since so i told him i have no idea
i did that too so i feel like this is honestly karma anyway back to my original point the break up was really civil almost friendly haha
i had to hide the fact i was panicking from my little sister who i share a bunk with and my parents
so instead follow subs of topics that interest you games you love authors music whatever not only will you make new friends you will also learn new things about the topic and maybe have interesting things to discuss
i have a hundred dollars from a visa gift card my grandparents gave me for christmas but that is all preferably it could be something online because i do not have my license yet and will have to ask my parents to drive
but i played it cool we even said that we can catch up for drinks again so i decided i am done i will be a spinster
i really would just be the happiest person if she just said hello to me but i guess the hardest part of it all is relearning to be ok with being alone again
and i do not want to break no contact but last night really is making me want to reach out to him
lots of fun lots of cuddling lots of laughter and joy but also lots violence abuse crying pain loneliness this summer though things changed
ex m27 and i f25 date for just over 4 years i got a ft job so it a year ago

even writing this out it is obvious he is abusive and manipulative and there is no reason i should miss him but i do
so my uncle has been an alcoholic forever most of the time being a functional alcoholic he never really bothered anybody
there not lazy or a bad person they just feel like a burden to the world and do not want to put there emotional pressure on you
yea i know it sounds as strong as it meansit is a sign given by mafia boss or capo that the one given that kissis going to die
college has been veryfast moving the first semester has ended and the exames are going to start in january and it feels like i have been holding my breath since college started i have been so busy that i do not think i have actually processed all that has happened since we moved i think we moved in august but i am not sure i have been forgetting things very easily

3 1 month after the bu i text her asking her to talk with me that night because i was having a really rough night because it was the anniversary of my fathers death she responded the next morning saying i am sorry last night was rough and that i can not be there right now i hope today is a bit better
and i tried telling her boyfriend and her father what happened but they would not even talk to me i had a brake down and i have not been the same sense
end on good terms not get back together physical pain or injury or physically injured so literally that where hurt stops let us say it is emotional hurt
i got panicked because it was unfamiliar to me and ended it because of a few petty disagreements that i failed to talk through sufficiently
how to be single and happy by jennifer taitzi am looking for something that is not female centric like most titles out there
is there hope should i continue chatting with her or is it really over is she leading me on just all these questions and i do not know what to do i do not even want to be alive anymore
i tried as hard as i could to explain that is not true but she got even more mad and talked about how she was glad she knew i only wanted sex and she dodged a bullet basically
but right now i need my space and i need my time to heal i do not expect an answer to this letter
communication was always our biggest issueit is frustrating how i can not watch tv made by aliens i am sick of people and their ways
accumulated momentum and habit of extreme continued solitude check repeated failures of greatly motivated attempts involving great effort and work input to fix that scenario check
we are keeping in touch and still doing facetime we flirt and stuff so i 23f recently moved out of my ex boyfriends 24m apartment
it been 2 month since i lost him and it still hurts and each day that goes by i get lonelier i often question if something happened to me who would care and alot of similar questions like am i even worth having as a friend
i do not understand that at all he could not explain any further than that he said he could not put into words what he feels
luckily i lived across town i could be there for my dadhelp get him to this appointments and visityet i was isolated enough that i did not have to deal with the excess family shit i tried to escape
but when we are not together which is most of the week he will spend his time catching up with his friends or playing video games with them
i will not talk trash make fun of her in a bad way or tell sensitive things about her i am better than those people who do that
my weary tired heart is not even that sad i am so proud of myself i will need yaall to climb through the sadness that ensues until i have reached the other side this time i will be strong if not for myself then for my future self enough of settling down for assholes just because you love them
why should i put in all this work just to live a normal life no one seems to talk about it maybe i am just lazy but i do not give a shit i am crying as i write this maybe today i can end this fucking painful existence
and i could not care less at that moment since i was three months swimming across that river as a pro and did not need anyones guard anymore
i think that comes forward with hiding feelings of loneliness admitting to yourself you do not need to reach out to people
he intentionally gave me herpes because he did not want me to leave him and i did not like it is really shitty i am all by myself
but here i am now my birthday is in january by spring i was on my own and i moved away
i am kind of back to even cutting i had thought of how i would give it all up and even expected suicidal thoughts to vanish
i was closing an eye on the danger but i do not regret it because it was because i was trusting her
i have been trying to get into therapy for years to deal with my anxiety and depression but i never seem to have the money i know lots of other people are in this boat and i wondered if there were any strategies that your therapist has given you that would be helpful or even things they have said that resonated with you
i still love him funnily thinking about him makes my intrusive thoughts about my sexuality bearable when we were happy we were both the happiest we have ever been
i am writing this listening to my boyfriend snore on the other side of the world we fall asleep in calls to feel closer but i just feel so empty
the best part is he knew i lost my dog this week so this morning he says i just can not do this
my so lives with her but finds himself seeing her maybe 1 hour every day if he is lucky despite that he is not much of a talker or a feelings type of person
2 learn to deal with external circumstances being able to expect the unexpected is key i was so thrown off by certain things initially but after the initial shock i opened up to whatever came my way that did not mean that crazy stuff did not keep happening to me but since i expected them i was better able to handle them that boosted my confidence which made me more magnetic to people
23 people have been hitting on me on the past weeks i am not a hot guy or something pretty unusual but i know 2 of these 3 wanted me because they expect me to settle for anything to not have preferences and stuff which is understandable but what a poor mentality
with all the regular hangouts closing for the virus i am realizing how bored i get its bringing back memories of my childhood stuck at home for months on end with no friends and fear of change i almost went completely insane
your efforts will be rewarded in the end the matter has escalated now we do not have dinner together and do not speak much
i am very strict with my nc and i have not texted him for a month after we broke upbut now i am crying and am completely broken to my soul
i am right now giving her as much space as i can and trying not to think about those things but i do not trust her closest friend and a lot of people think she is a bad influence
but because during so much of my life i have not really had good adult role models in my life i do not know who to go to for help
and here is the thing it would not be such a big problem if it was not related with making children people do not usually choose their partners to make children rationally
my friend is saying that she does not think her family love her and would be better off without hernot going to lie i have no idea what to say so i am looking for people who have been through this and are on the other side for advice from what i can say or suggest to her
i have told my best friend a very small bit of this but that is it i need to tell someone but to everyone i know irl this will come across as wtf i would rather not so if you guys have anything i would love to hear it
i just want to know why he was so annoyed to talk to me and basically said talking will not help anything and will only make the process last longer of moving on
you can improve and grow but it also helps you to reflect and become aware of the mistakes that someone else made
one of the things i spoke about in the letter were the things i really enjoyed and missed about our relationship
we had an amazing time during our relationship i enjoyed it all i could spend every breathing moment with her not say a word not do a thing and still be happy but my selfconfidence problems ruined
i hate that i hate her for this and i hate that i still love her i thought it would be easier by now
the other night i just stopped texting her completely i can not keep talking to her when i still want to be with her but she does not
our relationship was codependent and very much not healthy neither of us had any friends anymore or knew what we were going to do with our lives
but here is the kicker every time i think about the bad stuff in my life i get mad at myself for thinking it is so bad
i know healing is not linear but i feel like i have gone through the steps denial anger bargaining so far mostly in order although there was some overlap
i always end up just sitting and not paying attention or getting distracted by doing other stuff so all of the semester i almost missed all of the classes
i have diagnosed manic bipolar disorder but it feels like my lows are getting worse and closer together there seems to be no hope at all everything is pointless
it is ok if this gets ignored just needed to pour my heart out but i can not how could he want me soo badly 3 weeks ago yet nothing
i was really wrong two days later she texted me saying we needed to meet and talk right away i tired not to think the worst but when i pulled up next to her car she was already waiting for me outside she looked so mad and fed up i had never seen her like this
then the silence starts she tells me just go home and here i am 630pm on my study and she refuses to talk to me she has text me to tell me her dogs need to use the bathroom
i can not see any redeeming qualities to me and the fact that trying to get help has taken over one whole fucking year it is difficult to feel positive at times like this
that is when she went full fucking psycho like seriously drunk dialing me in the middle of the night showing up where i work harassing all of my female friends it was bad one day my car got keyed in the parking lot of one of the gyms where i worked i could never prove it was cleo but cmon who else would it be
i just want to get back to working for myself and making a life for me as well as my mother
i want to message her but i just do not want this to lead to more dysfunction in my life i do not handle rejection well and i suffer deeply from imposter syndrome
my girlfriend broke up with me 2 days ago friday since then i totally lost myself i feel like half of me was ripped out i feel very empty
yes i separate my major depressive disorder self from my own self they are two different people today i have goals i have life to live
i have not been for so many years and now that i also have ptsd i honestly think i am going to start hurting myself again
for months and months he treated me better then i had ever received i said i would only break up with him when hell froze over and he felt the same
i just recently got kicked out my moms house due to the fact that i still keep in contact with my father
it is unbelievable how much my perception of reality itself can shift when i get into what i will just call one of those depressive phases but i think what is the unfortunate truth for most things related to mental health is it is like trying to explain the experience of drugs not only is it different for everyone but you will never be able to explain it in words that other people who have never experienced mental health is like to be honest i lost my train of thought mid sentence and i am too lazy to go back and remember the point i was making
does this kind of shame because people to pop the cyanide pill and end it all it is not in attempt to persuade myself not to nor inform others it is just
in my case the punishment is invisible so i can not stop worrying you will tell me about jesus but my ocd doubts a lot so i can not say to myself relax jesus knows because jesus maybe is not real what if there are gods not from a religion that do not care about my ocd and accept these promises
i have not decided when i will do it for now i am just not drinking i do wish to have some alcohol what else i am done with life and life is done with me i feel loved by some people maybe or maybe it is all an illusion
i only go outside when it is dark every night so i can cry and be alone with my thought but even then i am oblivious
i have no idea why he would be so sad and upset in the process this was my first relationship since my exfiancee cheated on me circa 2018
i know this is explained poorly and i would be willing to answer questions if there are any i just do not want other people feeling the way i am
he has not shown any kindness towards me or any interest it is all just normal polite daily things sorry if this is a lot of reading for you
we laughed all the time we liked most of the same things we could have deep conversations about serious topics until 3 am and we could discuss difficult things in a way that was nonconfrontational
today made me feel so dead inside i ruin the day for my parents and then get really emotional about everything
not to mention all the people that i am seeing on social media that are celebrating as though we are not in the midst of a global pandemic
i want to try using discord more because then i can hear peoples voiceshowever the anxiety does not help any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thank you for reading and i hope your days are better than what i am currently going through
i truly wish i was dead i do not like my lot in life anymore i am 38m have struggled with depression family suicide trauma homelessnesspoverty compulsive underachieving it was not just this year when i realized that this pattern was too hard to bear but this year has just slammed me with it
my parents have lost both of their jobs we are getting evicted soon both my dogs have died in the past month none of my friends talk to me anymore my life feels so fucking useless now it feels like everything would be better if i just ended it all
this is also the closest thing i have done in terms of reaching out but as i am typing all this out it feels dumb like this is something stupid i should be able to overcome by myself and should not have to reach out to strangers to talk about
i just want to know how do you go from 100 to 0 just like that as if nothing ever happened
i just want to feel nothing i do not know if i can ever be in a comfortable emotional state that i used to have
i am left to grieve suffer on my own i feel angry at people who tell me life is going to get better
i passed out in front of her maybe due to too much stress she was surprised and gave me a bottle of water and watch me as i take my meds
love who you are embrace who you are love yourself when you love yourself people can kind of pick up on that they can see confidence they can see selfesteem and naturally people gravitate towards you
i am scared no terrified that i will lose my job over it i was falsely accused it destroyed my mental fortitude what if i ask a woman to hang out over some coffee it is always a possibility she will run to hr and i will get fired
i hated myself i hated my life and even though i did not have any plans for self harm or suicide i definitely would not have minded being involved in an accident that would have severely injured me because i wanted to escape it all
my cognitive skills are also starting to get worse i keep missing keys when i type which is not normal for me since i use a keyboard a lot and can touch type without a problem
in fact my life is pretty darn great i live close to family have a stable job and i got promoted
i do not know what to do here to help myself she did not even say goodbye to me just went out to her car ready to leave
i do not really have any friends or talk to anyone at work and on my days off i just wander around shopping centres and malls alone and all by myself
my day was already bitter because over the weekend i had a huge argument with a friend of mine some words were exchanged and then she blocked me on everything
all i wanted from him was to just try and work through our challenges together and be a bit more understanding of our emotions
and she started scolding me about how i am wasting time playing videogames when i am supposed to study for ielts and get my health issues under control by doing the things the doctor asked me to do
9 months ago she broke me it is been a hell of a ride between finding myself being sick for 7 months and trying to fix myself i am tired of missing her tired of thinking of her at least once a day if your reading this learn to not give your all to someone it is sucks and hurts worse when they leave
any advice on other subs if this is not the right one basically talking about how my life has effected me and my mental health up to this point and i have noone else to talk to so i am making my first post on here
those two things really helped i gradually started feeling worse and worse anxiety whether it was going out being at school or just random waves throughout the day
so more on this letter basically the letter was worked on a few minutes a day throughout a month so i can really nail the message it contained
i hear it is incessant call on my flesh and wants of having a familyi hear it they were my family now i have no family or friends only my wife
it makes me sick to my stomach thinking about how it will affect them but i can not keep living like this
i am waiting for the right time or for me to develop some sort of terminal illness by chance so i can say goodbye more easily to my family
i do not want her back my family recently reminded me smugly as if i am the abuser that she is recovering well that she is been undergoing therapy for past relationship abuse and found somebody who is helping her heal and loves her very much they live happily i do not want her back
this constant fucking anxiety and dread infesting my head it is so tiringi am currently studying for exams in january but no matter how hard i try i still feel so stupid
i hope things look up for all of you as well you have got thishi first of all sorry for my bad english
all of that positivity for nothing i thought i was getting better oh wellsorry for my grammar i am not native english and i am trying my best here cheers
it fucking hurts like hell you are lonely as hell and because you are stuck at home in a pandemic time drags by excruciatingly slow making it that much harder
i know that i am focusing on the bad things and missing out on the good things in life to be honest i do not really know what to say
i opened the texts and everything he said i was paranoid for thinking turned out to be totally true and so much more
when i was grinding for a year straight insane hours lonely 1012 hour day after lonely 1012 hour day after lonely 1012 hour day to learn web development from scratch i had a vision in mind this vision was of me being a web developer being a successful respected individual who had his life together who had a real job awesome job lived on his own had solid financial resources and had his life together
but then i realized what was going on and began to refused money as well and she cheated on me 3 times and i never saw her again
my best friend 25 told me that they want to die they are not suicidal but they do not think there is anything to look forward to work towards anymore
have you ever been in the situation where you would like to interact with people but the fear of rejection fear of being judged overthinking or something else stops you from doing it
even then we stayed together the relationship began to change though we would fight over everything and it started to become bitter towards each other
she is my best friend and my lover and i do not want to go on living without her she is everything to me and without her i have nothing
loneliness here takes a big part in this rant i have talked to her every day and she knows she can count on me when the big sad comes
it is been a year but i miss her everyday while she moved on and made new friends it is like calling the bermuda triangle dangerous i know what i am
my first semester of college was inperson and i finally started to make a few good friendshipsbe grateful that you even have a chance to live today and remember that you can always die tomorrow
the tiniest things i mean the smallest of the smallest have been making me burst into uncontrollable tears today i cried while playing taboo a family card game because i was not able to describe my word
i just want her to be happy and i want her to find happiness for herself i just can not bare losing her anymore
there is a part of me that took it to heart i got a little sad and it flowed through my mind the whole day
are these feelings valid and understandable or am i just pouting thank you for any input it just sucks to go through this in the current moment
to all the people in my life that were jealous and bullied me for being happy young and beautiful you all tried to tear me down and ruin my self esteem i remember
and i agreed i left and got me thinking why would he stay with her talking at 12am and was really worried
the little hope and happiness just seems too much compared to the pain and suffering i hate everything please help me
i did everything for him yet it was never enough i am broken and there is nothing i can do to fix me rather than wait for a miracle
but what use is any of it when i come back to my place after work and there is noone there when the last time i speak is on friday leaving work and the next time i speak is on monday coming into work it is selfish of course but i just wish for something better for myself
i have gone through two months of no contact now and it is been so hard when we broke up i lost weight from depression
i just can not understand that y did not she said this before or while we were chatting it has been 6 months almost but i still can not get over her
i am not the best with describing how i feelfelt so if anybody has any tips on how to explain how much paranoia warps reality and how i could get it through to him that it was in no way anything he said or did that would be greatly appreciated because i can see its hurting him and i do not know how to fix that
i do not celebrate christmas i do not do christmas i am jewish every year from yom kippur to purim i want to hang myself from my apartment building roof and the feeling only grows as time passes
in addition online classes have not been helping as well as no nature to go to probably affected me alot i have been on a limbo between having a break and doing work only to end up doing nothing but still constituting it as doing work
everything feels like it sucks all the energy out of me even just replying to a friends message feels like a big task
my ex gfs baby was a like my own daughter i treated her like my own child and i never once abandoned her until that moment
i would mutter what the fuck is happening what the fuck am i doing what is fucking wrong with me to myself as i stared at my selfset work timer
the four walls of my bedroom are driving me crazy i try to eat well and sit in the sun listen to music and tend to some houseplants
i was basically trash talking about my boyfriend telling him everything wrong about him i even suggested he suffers from a mental illness but refuses to go to a therapist

oh i want to share what happened today nobody to sharewho to share they say you have your friends right but
from the years of breathing you in i found that you truly are apart of me as the time passes i always try to exhale alittle harder so i can rid you of me but the parts of you i breathed in have nourished and grown my cells so you will forever be in my veins
i do not want to be a 30 year old loser nothing will change for the better it never does it just gets worse
i do not know what i am doing in this world i am barely existing can not call what i am doing livingi am just seeing the days passing by waiting for my inevitable and hopefully soon death

the last film this happened to be was harry potter and it was last year when one of the main characters dies i was so lost in my own life for a solid week i had no intention to do anything no interest in anything i had trouble sleeping and i would binge eat
she can not say if she will get feelings for me again but she can also not say if it is never happening again
it is after midnight the time my brain goes the most awry and i am reminded of all the past mistakes people i have lost and i will never get back
so i have no one to talk too about this been with my boyfriend for 10 years and we have been through the highest highs and lowest of lows together and we just broke up no fights no arguing just an appreciation for the life we have shared and acknowledging it has come to an end
i think i may have addadhd it does not feel normal it feels like more than laziness i tried many study and productivity hacks nothing works i have zero willpower or self control i can not make myself do anything and when i try to do something i fail
there is more to that which i choose not to discuss i can not live with my mother anymore she was on oxygen and had major health problems copd emphysema
i have just drilled into my mind that i need to be independent in everything i do when i know deep down i can not
human beings exist only in relation to one another no man is an islandlife seems so different everything has changed for me i am in a whole new town all different people
having lgs also means at any given time if she falls asleep she might not wake up due to a seizure in her sleep i hate this overwhelming feeling
i struggle with anxiety and find it hard to talk to people and make friends but i have made some in one of my classes
forgive me for the extreme example but many people get into a habit of idolizing their ex just like the example illustrates they put them on a pedestal and treat them like a god they think oh shit they were the one
i would imagine myself a monster and fantasized about shooting up the school part of the outlet for these rage fantasies was my sister
he said that i might have bpd but not for surethese last days i can not focus i keep hearing those music tracks sounds and voices talking
fill your heart with smoke and the first thing that you want will be the last thing you ever need that is how you fight it
i just do not know what alternative there is bough of these groups are judged by the moderates who point out about how we are not normal
i would never harm myself but it feels as though life is seriously pointless moving forward i only want to make her happy i have been through some rough breakups but i have not loved someone this deeply
no it is because you truly loved them with no drawbacks no second thoughts you loved them probably deep down still do even after they broke you with no urge to have that love back but with the purpose of a pure heart
but i just do not feel like i am over her things still remind me of her i still look at tinder just wondering if she will be there if i will see here in public
i do not know how to cope and am torn up over the fact that he does not love me in the same way
i guess the reason why i am posting with is i have been this way for the past 8 or 9 months a depression that i just can not over seem to over come i do not remember the last time i was happy i fake happiness around everyone in real life i am living in groundhog day and nothing changes no matter how hard i try
i have the rope i could jump in front of a car plenty of options i do not have much to live for
so expect a lot of refferences its my favourite band since its about my loneliness depression and plans i guess it fits
i was 15 and when i first met him he simply added me on an international whatsapp group where i was not talking much but when i was i always remember having interesting conversations with him that i never managed to have with any other person i have met
all these people already had their basket of bonding needs and wants and desires and dreams filled i keep seeing lgbt people on social media or whatever live their best lives
it is beginning to because quite the inadequacy complex and an unbelievable hopeless that anyone could ever love me beyond an initial meeting
i lived with it today she came over with a friend saying she wanted to talk to me about something they get here and we sit in my room and jordan never really had anything she wanted to talk about she just said it for some reason
i may be a bit awkward at first because i am nervous meeting people i have started watching pornography a lot and have started smoking pot to clear my mood
keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadowyou learn more about someone at the end of a relationship than at the beginning
it got better then it got worse then it kept going in cycles apparently i am quite picky my first therapist i saw for 11 years
i have a group of friends at school but i do not talk to anyone outside of school and some of them make me feel like crap
we think that change is a choice we think change is in our control change happens if we like it or not we are constantly changing everyday moment every second every minute every hour which ultimately will lead to every day every week month year and so on
which is even weirder because voyeurism is one of my kinks i do not really know what is happening with me and i am not really concerned
i feel hurt and keep wondering if i did something wrong or if i was being greedy i lean towards having an anxious attachment style so now i am just
i do not know how to get out of this headspace i still enjoyed her company and her while she was trying to get me back for three months
he told me at that breakup that i never have time for him which he is right i have a hard time turning off my computer at 5pm i grew up in a close knit family and spend a lot of time with my parents and siblings he says he is dead last compared to everyone else i agree with him here i just never realized it until he told me during this breakup
everything changed when he had to go back to his town we lived in north italy but he is originally from south italy because he had to take care of his terminally ill mother at that moment one thing i forgot to say tha after 2 months i moved in with him my father died so i had and still have a grieving process going on
what did you expect did you think i was just going to forget everything and call you to listen to your problems like the perfect girlfriend i am not
i felt betrayed because i had to find that almost by chance and she told me never to talk to her because i was trying to insert myself between them
my best friend accidentally found out about me quitting my job early november he had been trying to get ahold of me but i had no phone service or internet
i am constantly crying i have tried getting advice from people but they always say the same shit she did not deserve you you are young
if i keep believing i am unworthy of love i will never find it and if i do i will screw the relationship up somehow because i will be chockfull of insecurities and emotional issues
i will not get into the specifics too much and it is all documented in past posts but i keep beating myself up over mistakes i made in our relationship and after the break up
i f 20 was dating someone m 24 for a couple of months but things became gradually distant and he stopped making an effort to see me
my insomnia is currently at it is all time worst and it currently midnight and i really do not want to be awake another 10 or so hours any and all suggestions appreciated
i can feel my loneliness get worse day by day and drag me deeper into an empty cavei think i am so smart and have a lot of things to offer the world
i told her why not now and she said confused what and i said let us take off our clothes and have a normal conversation completely naked
i was in a mental health facility and since i have gotten out the word treats mw different it is hard for me to connect to people is there anybody else who just feels like a side charater like life sometimes passes by instead of through ya am i alone on it

the other things that raised flags he gave money every month to churches in other states by mail he is republican and a born again christian and maybe goes to church 12 times a yr he listen to christian music in his car all the time says it makes him feel good
i would genuinely like to end this long trip we had together on a sad at least for me but pacific note somehow
i do not feel capable of having healthy romantic love i have always wanted it for the wrong reasons social status to fit in to get physical touch and intimacy
i have seen doctors and psychs but it really does not help i want so bad to be back to my old self but this downhill spiral is now at the bottom
i honestly think that i do not really have anything going for me in the long term i am not the type of person anyone in the world wants to interact with on a friendship basis so when translating that to any relationship that is not platonic i am 9999 sure that relationships are impossible for me i have family sure that is something however honestly familial love is not something i really care about
i am not a very healthy person mentally i can be happy i can smile but give it enough time and i will not feel nice anymore even if i can smile through everything i always know that i can not do anything that i am not worth anything
i am drowning in anxiety and self hatred i do not know what to do i know deep down it is a rebound relationship but i am struggling
if you do not you are thrust into a pool of minimum wage jobs struggling to afford basic necessities hoping that you will be lucky enough to work your way up the ladder or find a job that does not require a masters degree as more and more do nowadays
my bf just started working and i feel abandoned already i am so super sad about having to figure out how to be alone
i cry everynight i feel bad i just feel like i failed and that it was my fault while she forgot me faster than what i though it would be
i had my practicum in my maternity rotation and i know i said i never wanted kids but this rotation is giving me baby fever haha
sometimes i suspect i am being used under the guise of friendship but i still stay anyway anything to fill the gaping void inside me
after that me and her went on a bike ride together then finally i had her over at my place so we could cook
i was emotionally prepared for the distance as we both wanted to make it work more than anything as we been through a lot a lot a lot together and had rough times but in the end we helped each other out grew from those experiences and became better people because of the relationship it really was perfect
made this the other night on spotify going through an emotional divorce coupled with living alone in quarantine timestimes are rough mentally music is therapy to me hopefully it will be for you
i do not know why i am writing that but i guess it can not hurt me more he was my first love but it is over now and it is time to move on especially for myself
i feel so insignificant because the things that haunt me are so fucking minuscule yet overtake my life i can not have a normal conversation without it leading back to me remembering how much i fucking hate myself
i am wondering what kind of communitybased initiative would best help people who experience loneliness i recognize we are unique individuals but how can your community better support you what is it that makes you feel part of something
and in additionally this led a mad person like me to think more about time because i am lonely and i am starting to focus on damn time for some reason
it is known that mental health issuesdisorders are not necessarily curable you can manage them better with a combination of self management cbt support medication etc
when i told him my plans of wanting to attend nyuucla medical school he got visibly upset because i would be leaving him even though he would already have his degreemasters
then life does not mean much i have my ambitions and goals i need to fulfil but without friends competence and family is all i have left and if i am incompetent at achieving my dreams then ill really will not have much left
i remember before her i spent 3 years working on me and i had such high stamdards that i could not fully commit to anyone in the end
i do not know what to do once school starts again my life will go to shit i am probably going to repeat a class and there is nothing i can do about it bcs i am a fucking idiot i do not see what else to do i am seriously considering it
i assume that we get used to live life in certain way and it is just a wrong way the only way to change it is to break your old habits
the persistently violent and sexual and just unwanted thoughts that still torment me all began i just wanted to go so i can finally get diagnosed with ocd so i can put that to bed you know not cure it but i think getting an official diagnosis would help me
i kind of just laughed it off but it kind of hurt my feelings have been in a jumble lately and i really do have a bad memory i also think my bad memory is one thing because lately i have not had the best sleep it really hurt to basically be called pathetic by my mom
i wish i had not spent so much of my life alone i wish i had friends besides my teachers i love him so much i wish he felt the same way
does anyone have advice on how i could make her more comfortable every advice would be highly appreciateddo americans not value their purest first love like asians
at the beginning of our relationship she told me she cheated on him to get out of the relationship but by the end she said she would never ever cheated
but yeah i guess i am keeping my zopiclone now wondering how many it takes to fatally overdose has always been on my mind does anyone know
it has been a month with no contact he never replied to my message and i am not sure if i should reach out again
she is far from perfect as am i obviously and in so many ways our relationship was very unhealthy and destructive for both of us but leaving today made me feel like my heart was being ripped out
eventually if i fall asleep i crush for like 1320 hours or on normal days when i need to sleep i smoke weed but recently it does not help that much anymore
i will go to my fav place gym and take out my aggression i am enough for me and yet i am not
i can not do simple things like going to a concert without overthinking and being nervous and anxious about being caught because i always go to these with stan twt friends who i have never met irl
i am gay also and was married for two years to a guy thought i loved and it hit me one day it was not right resulted in a fight and been separated now for almost a year i felt this situation broke me
i do not know what else to say but thank you for reading me no one depends on me if one of us had to die
ever feel lonely or out of place despite being around people sure you can say that it is common when it is a group of people you do not know however what about when it comes to your close friends loved ones
i can activatey high conscious but eventually i zone out again after a bit i have been training myself to go back to normal but the longest i can last is 1520 seconds
however due to me being alone alot growing up alot of skills i would have learnt growing up were not there and this friend ended up getting emotionally hurt badly because of it
i have tried a few different ones and every time i would end the conversation feeling worse but there are times when i need support and can not talk to my therapist so i need something what is an actual helpful one that you all have had experience with
this year i do not see my mum often because of her work it is just me my cat and this big empty house
today i wrote a message in my journal with my own bloodmultiple times life will throw you so many curve balls and it constantly will but look at yourself
also another note is she is a homebody and retired so she will always be home especially with covid all i know is if she moves in i am done
i told no one i was going to ask him out and just did it when i wanted to without thinking
so my aunts cat came into the room for literally for maybe 2 seconds that i could not see him so i know he could not have done anything
ugh i do not know and i hate how much i am over thinking this i try movies reading games but everything seems shallow and right after this feeling of emptiness comes right back
i did not speak to him cuz he would not give me freedom and would shout at me for stupid things
i am finally at a point in my life where i realize the pattern i am working on raising my standards and establishing boundaries with out feeling guilty
now for the actual things i am feeling excluding the things clearly explained by my ocd and adhd no one how much he wants me back and wishes he could forgive me
so i followed him around daily talking down and trying to get him out of this state but i was dealing with someone i no longer recognized he had this glazed desperate look in his eyes
after 10 days he asked me to get back together because he loved me deeply and was missing me so much even if we had not seen each for six months
they get into accidents get sick or face bankrupcy after unfortunate events i should not be able to achieve them either i do not want my suicide to be a culmination of my life i want it to be a sudden stop that is what a real death should look like in my opinion
this was almost enough for me to put us on a break because i truly felt he needed to be serious about working on his issues
he stopped talking to me for several days and was pushing me away saying that if i did not want to have sex he did not want to be near me like holding hands or kissing
he seemed to never judge me and always provided reassurance on how strong i am because of my past how i am beautiful out of his league he is never felt like this before and he would want to know now then six months in
id say life is no joy from since at least 16 and especially the last few years i feel a burden at times
she put me on a different medication for adhdadd i was very pessimistic about it i was expecting no great results
if this was the case she need to leave me alone and let me go she ignored this message and immediately tweeted than she and her bf were meeting with a realtor
i am an unwantable and i see my death as revenge for ignoring my cries i hope that if i die the world will notice and start a revolution where we all retaliate we all deserve to be loved do not we but why the fuck am i the first to be unloved do you want me to show you how awful you people are please give me the love i deserve for fuck sake
so last time i visited basically a week ago we had a total fallout i stayed at his flat for a few days
i took away her best friend which is something i never wanted to do plus anything or anyone that remotely brings joy also brings a lot of heartache to me
well no mercy for my poor bastard soul she instantly said we are not meant for each other i can not handle her we are not a good match we need time apart is what she says
now i have no way to go abroad for studying i have to stay in south korea i wanted to go abroad to get a better education and a better job
he supposedly can not account for 3 hours or so at all maybe wandering the streets and i angrily told him that i am done because he does not respect me
i am just going to preface this by saying that i hate my appearance treatment resistant depression led me to the wonderful world of weight gain i see myself as someone with a lot of charisma though not to sound pompous but i have always been someone who makes people laugh naturally this is one of the few things i like about myself as humor plays a huge role in fighting mental illness for me
this is mora an outburst i do not know thanks for who read till here have a good day just the way your mind feels if that does not help imagine you have been awake for a few days
once i realized it i was so overwhelmed and sad that everyone could tell i i was off i sat through it quietly
masturbation was also another issue although the sex fell off pretty hard about a month ago she never wanted to have sex but she would be mad if i took care of myself
you know i really prayed that god could hear me whatever form or whoever they are i just wish that someone out there could hear me cry and help me
i feel like a part of myself and my whole future have been violently ripped away from me i feel alone
if you are reading this you are wasting your timemy question is i want to know how to approach talking about her brothers ocd in a delicate matter
if anyone else has experienced this sort of breakthrough lmk if it permanently improved your mental health if its just a temporary thing but a useful tool in solving your issues or if there is something else i need to do now
i feel like there is some kind of bad karma or something trying to make me feel shitty and alone and i mostly blame myself for the actions of my exboyfriend and friends
i will be laying in bed being fine and then suddenly i get stressed outanxious about my life both school and social and i can not stop thinking about it but the worst of all is the pain in the back of my head when this happens
but as i know myself it will probably take quite a while before i admit it i know myself i was never good at handling breakups
like i said i was spending most of my day in bed so i had nothing to tell her and these call were awkward
i do not want him to do something dumb with his life because it will be my fault and i do not think i could handle that
9 the anxiety has been getting weaker and weaker even though it kind of depends on the days but the thoughts and the groinal responses are very much still there
i am barely making it to work now and i been stuck here for a while i do not want to think or feel or anything it is so tiring i hate it
i am pretty sure she can relate to a lot of these things i just talked about above probably not all of them but a pretty good amount i think or maybe not
i lost everyone i am not sure what is going onmy heart goes out to you all be gentle with yourselves please 3
i do not know if this years lockdown year 12 anxiety and social problems had put me deeper in my previous subconsciounly forgotten mental health problems i am non diagnosed and have never seen a psychiatrist but it is brought something bad out of me
it went on for years the cycle of abuse neglecthe lied about so many things and the things about amy really hurt me
why it is bs you are probably not trying to be a friend but are searching for a way to keep the emotional connection intact or you are searching for a sneaky way to rebuild the relationship back up in any case there is just too much emotional baggage around your past relationship right now to consider a friendship so just do yourself a favor and do not go back at least not until you are fully healed
that is the hardest pill to swallow i am so scared i will not find someone great who will choose me then we met in person the next day she broke up with me
i want to know if anyone is in a similar situation where they just can not get fall asleep or feel tired
i try to spark conversations about similar interests but it never works i thought maybe it just did not click with these persons and that is ok it happens
i have often found myself being refered to as easy because i enjoy sex and do not require an emotional connection to form a sexual one
should i tell anyone i feel so alone i do not know what to dook so i did fuck up my last few relationships i was not the best partner
been staying at my parents house since april with nothing to do and i hate my life my partner is in another country and i miss them with my whole soul
so i stopped texting my ex and just recently she told me that i am a douche for not texting her now i feel bad because i love her but she does not want me back so i see no point in texting her
yes i agree i was very persistent because the more i got to know her the more i thought of what we could be if we got the chance
i was just the girl they talked to when they were not sure what assignment was due tomorrow because otherwise they would ignore me
the feeling of being ignored is what hurts the most not just a year or two but mostly my whole life
i kept repeatedly asking myself why i was not good enough he came back after two months only to pervert my feelings invalidate me
truth be told i still always feel lost deep inside like that helpless little girl despite my friends telling me that i am pretty confident smart friendly and that i have a bright future ahead
i just want to feel love like that again but i will wait she needs to work on herself i respect that
something in me tells me that we just need to give ourselves time and we will work outi do not know how to feel or if i am in dennial still
and so now i am sitting here just alone and thinking about how i do not matter to people who matter to me
my dream of possibilities in love companionship pull away with cords yanking them down further into the pit of my stomach until the wave of pain smoothens across my entire body
i do not know what the fuck to do in real terms to actually see myself on track in the near future
though it was never always bad sure we had a lot of bad moments and it got very toxic but i do not hate you for it i hope you know that
i hate you andrewthe only time i really feel ok anymore is either when cutting or when talking to people on hotlines
how did you handle moving on i am terrified of just being my own individual person again and i am scared that all those years will not mean anything to me anymore
so i 32f met my ex 36f on a dating site back in july we have been texting all day every day ever since
maybe i am one of those people i just feel like i think more deeply i do not even know if it means i am smart but do people like me who think more deeply get more depressed or lonely i feel this way quite often
to the point where people would ask me why i never talk i have dealt with some things in the past i think that is what changed me
i got my hair cut yesterday and right now i am feeling that it is so clean and soft and it is that way only for me
i drunk texted her one night asking her to reconsider her decision she said no that i am just part of her memories that i should let go and move on
my 4 years bf and i broke up one month ago but we are still leaving in the same flat until the end of quarantine basically he left me because of a lot of personal and relationship issues and even if i feel devastate i totally agreed to this decision we hope to stay friends we have always been really close
i have no desire to live the idea of doing things is great and i have been up and doing things but i feel like a robot while doing them what is the point we had such a great thing going and i do not really see myself without them
the worst part is that i know how i am being and that this is wrong but i am also unsure of what to do
looking back maybe she felt the same way towards me as things ended with a sort of silent agreement but i digress
a little over a year ago i started experiencing very odd episodes that last around 20 seconds with an overwhelming feeling of familiarity and sick like uncomfortable feelings
my mother passed on the 6th i have no one who is here for me i was alone the day she passed and alone today
i am just so fucking upset because you are my person and i know you feel the same we just could not figure it out
my friends tell me when it happens i tell them repeatedly i do not feel real that i do not know who i am or even my own name
i took off my clothes and started behaving silly and after a couple of minutes she took off her clothes too
you will find it soon but you first need to find your own pure beautiful self you may have been lost for a while but you will be back and stronger for it
i began to severely regret leaving my ex gf during the course of my new relationship i missed the baby who called me daddy
i am going to take action and destroy this meaningless life of mine even if i got her back i would still kill myself just so my last emotion can be happiness
the issue of me holding back and not always being open about emotions was brought up several times though out our relationship and i was always honest when i told her how hard it is for me but that i am trying for her
for a long time i have wanted to try and end things most times i ended up in a e or our local mental health institution for a week or so
lastly on christmas day after an argument with my dad he kicked me out after i had said i was going to leave anyway if he was going to continue with yellinghaving a completely negative and just stuckup attitude after him and my step mom had been in bad moods and been assholes to each other and all 4 of us kids that day anyway
tldr my ex 30m and i 29f broke up this weekend because he held his female best friends hand while rubbing it to comfort her in front of me
i use to love getting texts or calls from friends now about the only conversations i have are the ones in my head
i have suffered from anxiety depression and plenty others before and all of them plague me as well making it harder to find someone who will actually accept me for me
i also need someone that knows what it is like to step out of there comfort zone to be able to handle different difficult situations in life
someone that i could press against the wall out of insanity and love i think in lotto you call this a double jackpot
i have decided to improve myself in this periodbecause i had felt that i feel lonelybut i assume it is psychologicalthat is why i closed my instagram accauntyeah it is true that i have improved myselfbut wonder that if i open instagram againis there any possibility to be sociable in this periodbecause i even do not have real friends
i do not think j thinks of me at all anymore i feel so incredibly isolated and alone i am painfully anxious with new people because i struggle trusting them which i was never like growing up
although he said he considers me an exand i just receiving punches from him after mistakes bonuses are rare and rarerly
i then rejoined that sexual story and found that not only had she kept the original sexual picture up but she posted more and more after she told me she was not
so i tell to him that i am so sorry but we need to break up but he started to cry and said to me that he love me
you know the kind that just passes by for long periods of time here and there and you do not remember life without those long periods of complete loneliness
is it a dumb idea i mean even if i do not die my liver will surely be fucked up i have heard you can die within 4 days if you do not get help
i think i have problems related to paranoia family history of schizophrenia bipolar bpd and such but i thought alcohol would help calm me or at least put me to sleep
i am not going to reach out it is certainly not my place to say anything about what she is doing
i had my reasons and believe i was in the right but i let things go to far and said stuff i did not mean out of anger
in our current break up she is as cold as ever and pays me no mind she goes out with friends all the time while i do not really have much to do since i have one main friend who always works so i either game or workout
i am reading this subreddit since my breakup and although i read a lot of good and encouraging stuff one thing is disturbing me most of people who write here seems to disown their relationship and there previous brgf in order to keep going
sorry if this is too chaotic to understand i do not speak english well 6 years together his now living with his mom and has not messaged us in weeks
go out with your friends fuck one of his be sexy go for walks do anything to get your mind off this
but once agian i am sitting here fucking stressed and depressed af this is so toxic and my relationship was not like this and my ex friend is just completely insane
oh yeah the problem that is on the top of my list rn is the pressure caused by expectation ahhh this is why i always degrade my capabilities around people i hate expectations they because me extreme nervousness anywhere is this anxiety or i am just over reacting
you might want them but you do not need them you do not need to depend on anyone but yourself the only future i can see for myself is one i do not want
i have tried so hard to make friends but i do not understand social cues and people just think i am a freak because i am anxious and weird in social settings
how i will do whatever i need to do to add to the finances how i am getting my moms jaguar as a car now to help
i have been through so many traumatic experiences and situations in my life i just feel so numb and sick and tired of suffering every day
i fell some things annoying like you are silently liying and my hair moves abit also i shooted its on camera but noone still can not see bright contrast at my face
i do not want to be here anymore so i do not even know why i would want to wait for monday to get tested i am so done with everything i can not take it anymore
there are a lot of experts like brad browning or that one french tall guyyou know who i am talking about with their own programs who just love to take advantage of men who are hurting and promise them how they can help them get their ex back in no time
and it is gotten me worried if she was running to them instead to me but this one particular ex of hers is what threw me off
they have purpose but i never figured out mine then sometimes ill hear a voice screaming my name telling me to come up
most of all things i hate crying in front of other people and showing that i am sad or that i even care for someone so deeply
in my mind it feels like i have a friend who is on life support and just wants me to pull the plug because of how much they are suffering but out of my own selfishness i will not let them
i lost the woman of my life the children we would have her kid her house i am too depressed to make strides in my life
during gift opening this year i did not have high expectations but that did not stop me from being hopeful maybe as an adult they might finally understand what i want but alas i was disappointed
the problem is he has no interest in listening to my needs he thinks the little effort he puts in is him doing me a favor
and we are so happy because them are getting help and on the other side i feel a little bit guilty because of that
when it seems it is you vs the world it is actually you versus yourselflove will find you my friend just tell me
oh my i am so bored not suicidal just perspective on how i see existencewant to know what it can not heal loneliness in fact time makes it worst much worse
i asked her why she loves me she said because i do not give up on her and i am still fighting for it
i can not say that things would have been different they just seemed inevitable i guess i got too invested i still care about him deeply and can not even be mad at him
that you do not think about them and a flood of sadness clouds you or if you see them you see a mistake and a memory m m
i just feel so alone in this feeling since i have no one to talk to about it i do not know how to deal with these feelings
i never wanted to but things happened he has mental health issues and chose a certain coping mechanism and became a dick when he was doing it
everything hurts still my hope that things will get better are becoming less and less than i thought were even possible
i feel like my mother ether has narcissistic personality disorder or bpd she has no regard for my feelings she can put on whatever facade she wants she is not fooling me anymore that asshole can rot in hell she has made me suicidal she is the main reason i am self harming this family is all kinds of fucked up and i want out
i grew up feeling that he did not want kids and that my mom and him never loved each other i did not think much of it when growing up i guess i thought it was normal but i can tell it caused some damages
i was going to support her decision with her body regardless of my own desires and both of us were leaning to terminate the pregnancy
but i can not do any of those things i am almost 21 completely dependent on my family 2 years behind in school
i was involved with a 28 year old woman who was my coworker and boss at the time at the amazon facility
i feel like i am a canary trapped in a cage or the room is filling up with water and the doors are locked
with me having those worries in mind when i was trying to really get more comfortable and trust jordan it made it hard i felt like i could really have a future with her but i am worried i will not be able to love her not that that matter anymore
a few hours later i met her and we got back together and on wednesday we were face timing trying to communicate a couple things and i just could not help the feeling of doubt that was on my mind that whole day and we broke up again
i decided to come here to look for advice i am a 32 yo male in semo area thinking i may not be mature enough for him
i honestly do not even know why i am posting here i do not know what will come out from this maybe my subconscious is thinking getting this out will make it more real
i am going through a break up after more than 15 years i am angry at a lot of different things i am about done
i am so numb yet in pain i have not been eating and sleeping much just for the next half a week to be just as bad again
they stopped talking with me right after the need was over this makes me feel more miserable and neglected as a person
it hits me hardest at night when i finally have time to think i think about how easy it is to make friends when i meet the right people but i feel where i am now i am surrounded by shallow grey ghosts of humans who share no similarities with me i guess i am that wierd guy who like bugs and telling jokes and heavy music
1 would most women breakup with someone over this i am panicking that i have limited my options now that i am ready to daterelationship because of my lack sexual experience early
i must have come up with hundreds of different unrealistic solutions while i did this each one of them just another placebo that got rid of this weird feeling in my head for a little while every time i believed that i found the answer and that this feeling would disappear if i just held on to this solution for long enough and that would end my inconsistency problem
she does not even want to be friends with me which is fine i guess so i avoid talking to her
so now i feel so guilty for not being in a good spot but he still wants to be there for me and i am grateful to have him now but it shows me exactly what we did not have and that makes me so sad for us but so happy to have him
this is what i want you to recognise whatever break up you are going through write down this first of all
but i miss how things were between us i then later dreamt about her that night it was mutual and the right thing to do
when i confronted her she said it meant nothing and it was out of loneliness i accepted this and still desired to make it work
i know it was probably for the best since you were not ready for commitment but this hurts so much and i am really struggling to get over it
so he is yelling at me to get in the car and i do but i get out at the first stop sign because he was being reckless
it will be gone in one hour i still can not sleep and its 343 all i can say is i have had a really bad day but i can not tell my only support my best friend anything
i do not really know what to make of it all i know i should be happy for them and i do not have any feelings for them at all we broke up a while ago but i still have this unexplained sinking feeling in my gut which i am confused about
she said i was mean a lot through the relationship brought up arguments a lot from the past but i am intelligent enough to know i am not a toxic person my family agree my friends agree my work colleagues agree even after explaining arguments we have had
occasionally i take a walk to mess around with a volleyball when i feel like it and i enjoy it but i can not do it every day because when i get home i do not feel like going anywhere for a couple of days
tldr woke up depressed took a walk to clear mind told my mom had an argument went to the bathroom to attempt suicide i survived
i pretended not to care but i was very sensitive to it and i cried in my bed i hated my family a little but hated myself the most
i am starting to get into stoicism recently and one of the lessons involved you are going to feel lonely if you allow it something along the lines of that and i am lowkey irritated it feels like i am invalidating my own valid emotions as though its wrong to feel lonely based on my circumstances i am just going to stop rationalising my feeling of loneliness and just let it happen
i want to believe i have a way of making up for these things that all men are usually expected to do
i was literally just doing the dishes in nothing but a very dim light doing the dishes we always told each other always and forever i wanted to be her husband
she was the only one for me and will forever be but these days i just can not find the motivation to do any of these
i hate myself for it but i do not know how to get out of thisall i do is sleep the whole day and dream about a better life
i have tried to rationalize it or stop myself like i am overthinking it but i just keep wrapping back around you said i could check in on you last week but i guess you were not being serious
i cannot hide my head under the sand and believe whatever the fuck i want because i am not delusional but when presented with reality i cannot for the life of me comprehend it
it is a long story and it is painful but we still respect and care about each otheri can not stop isolating myself because of this damn mental illness
but apparently she took it too literally and she messaged me and tried making normal conversation literally the same day it happened
sometimes breaking no contact does help but that is just for me personally the other dude i have known for maybe over a year but we are almost constantly texting eachother
i feel like i do not matter at all and he is just completely moved on but no matter how i feel i will always want you you will be the one that got away
as you an imagine i was panicking right there but i played it cool she is an amazing woman and i have always been completely obsessed with her from the very beginning
she won me over with all she said and i truly accepted her into my heart more than ever before from this
i was always able to look back on them and like some aspect of what we did together not this past one though
now my parents are searching the trash can because they want to know why there is so much in there but love is something which keeps your hopes up and i can not imagine a world without her
hi everyone i hope you have all been staying safe during this stressful time as a resource i want to share this website that helps you find a buddy to go through this tough time with find a quarantine buddy to do zoom yoga with play video games with or even just someone to talk to it is a great way to make this social distancing things a whole lot easier
ill call the office of the school id realistically be able to go to on monday to ask whether its too late to apply for this coming fall since i need some stuff cleared up from readibg but i just fucking know what they are going to tell me which is why i feel like this
because of how heartbroken my abuser left me i do not know if i will ever be able to trust another woman like that again i am pretty lost overall
i am constantly telling him what i need emotionally and he could not care less or at least he does not act like he does
i constantly do things we used to do together just hoping i run into her my life just does not feel the same
i always seem like i am okay when we talk but it is only because i do not want you to know that i still think about you every single day
my boyfriend and i broke up 2 days ago and i am dreading the holidays we had made all these plans to do things together and not being able to do them breaks my heart
i quickly realised how my whole life i never had any goals or ambitions i only followed my parents recommendations until this summer and when confronted with having to choose a university on my own i could not find anything that called to me so i as usual i did what my family believed best for me and went on to study something towards which i never had any passion or interest
if someone asked me why are you so angry or why are you so downthe only answer i have is why are not you
i wish there was a way to gift your life to somebody else this christmas because frankly i do not deserve anything at all whatever shitty god is out there must have done a huge freudian slip for me to be born in this godforsaken world i am so angry at everything the endless frustration hurts and the hallucinations keep clawing at my mind
i feel awful not only because i lost my best friend but i also lost the person who i loved more than anything
i have someone in my family who seems to be experiencing a schizophrenic episode he is been going down hill for the past few months but has denied that he needs treatment he was hospitalized a few days ago for what the doctors said is most likely catatonic schizophrenia which is the first diagnosis we have gotten he was bounced around from hospital to hospital because they did not have the mental facilities to handle him finally he became violent and was kicked out of the hospital and all the ones in our area will not accept him any idea on where to go next would be greatly appreciated
saying oh poor me i am going to commit suicide so i do not have to deal with titty pics at this moment my heart really broke
i had planned to meet up and ask her after the second lockdown but that never happened last monday i saw her walking her dogs with her ex who cheated on her i never confronted her about it but would still talk all day that thursday she suddenly stopped talking to me and has ignored all my messages since
i hate when people give shitty advice likedo not think about it too much or try to enjoy being alonelike if it was that easy to not feel like shit do you seriously think i would not have done it soonerand i guess these advices could work if someone is feeling lonely because of something temporary like covid or moving to somewherebut for people who have been lonely a long time they just simply do not
money is the only thing that matters to everyone on this earth life is only somewhat tolerable when i am stoned as fuck all of the time which is expensive
i could solve the problem of how to properly strategize endure and essentially shawshankredemption my way out of that house rent something suitable and start living on my own whilst also working insane hours in the first months of getting the dream job in web dev
i do not have any friends my only friend who was also my partner got fed up with me and replaced me
i want so badly to get help but now that we have zach i am starting to feel like it is selfish and even now i am doubting whether or not i should get it i am so done i can not do it
all the work i did for electronics i completely fixed their backroom their security room ext i knew their inventory like the back of my hand
she said its takes too much effort and she want to see how it goes without commitment any advice outside of the oversaid try clubs put yourself out there new hobby etc trust me
he called me while i was at work w he wanted to break up so i went over there and tried to make sense of it
i am very grateful that they thought of me because they did not have to get me anything but fucking hell this is the worst my eating disorder has been in years and being given food as a gift ontop of being forced to eat a fuck ton of christmas lunch etc is extremely triggering and it is making me feel disgusting
at one point we started arguing more and more sometimes even about some stupid things and now at the end he got tired of it all and realised that we are not for each other and that we do not have no common topics to talk about
and then i feel horrible over the fact that i can not get over it it has come to the point where are my perception of reality is negative
i want to cry about it but i know that there is no point because i can not control it but i still do anyways because it just passes time
but the demon just stop her with hes hand on she is headand i feel like hes smiling not visible like 67 feel like hes just part of me
i need to stop checking because it is inhibiting my healing but i am sincerely struggling to let her go is anyone our there
so a promise is being made to gods about not rearranging the books a punishmentcurse is asked in case breaking the promise
i have either been cheated on ignored or friendzoned i am friendly i feel like there must be something wrong with me at this point
my job was eliminated i was given the option of going to cap 1 or cap 2 i do not have meds on i do not do any drugs or drink
just being used by an abusive family member treated like crap by other people and never having the chance to ever love another man i think tonight might be the night i am either going to combine alcohol with cutting myself or swallowing whatever pills i can find ideally if i had a gun i would shoot myself in the head
outside of them and my immediate family i feel fucking worthless and unnoticed all the fucking time especially at my job
but in the last weeks it are not leaving me alone surrounded by cold white walls books and shelfs i just lay there without any emotion than loneliness
it makes me want to just leave this life because i will never feel as if i belong or as if someone really cares about me
do i need to fucking chomp my limbs off to be shortbang my fucking skull into the wall so my face gets smaller
besides if there are any articles that can give me knowledge about this please do not hesitate to share it feels like a boulder in my chest and i hope i am not just being over dramatic or crazy
i read a few books on the subject of loneliness and being single and i was wondering if you too had other titles in mind maybe talking about the side effects of loneliness can help

all i want to do is help him get better i want him to trust me and to count on me but i have encountered myself a small problem too i am not really good at comforting people i think i am a good listener but not a v good advisor and i want to become one for example sometimes i do not know what to say and respond to someone who is feeling down
i decided i was too scared to mention it to anyone and came here i guess i am just asking if it would be ill advised to take it again now or not
when the water is pure bad things may float inside the water later but we can always filter and scoop them out much easier than water which is not pure in reality we can not change our bodies but we can always change our minds a mind that deserves happiness and peace a virtuous mind derived from compassion kindness and mindfulness towards oneself and others

the few interactions i had with anglophones i came across seemed natural but my mom thinks it is all in my head lol even my ex gf thinks that but who knows maybe i have really gone mad all i know is that i am tired and that i have to find a solution before i end up hurting myself
i have none of thati have been on meds and done therapy but nothing worksi am extremely lonely and do not know what to do
as days go by it seems everyday i am always doing something wrong but it is not that i am doing anything wrong in my eyes it is more i am not doing it the way she would do it so that means my way is wrong

edit i live in an apartment complex that does not allow for pets so am unable to fill the gap with a dog or a cat

i am a liar i am a bad person what is the point of living if it is continuously being thrown in your face even when you have feel like you have grown even though you have grown your past is still thrown in your face and you try to hard not to mention the person throwing it in your face is not perfect either but they feel like they are caused they have never lied
there are better days and worse days but it seems almost nothing gets betterit feels like my body is giving up on life
i worked so hard every day and even when my brain told me to quit i kept going because i truly loved her that is just a fact
someone tried to kill me just over two years ago and i feel like that should of been my time there and then
before i forget i have to say that i am listening to the pokemon national park theme and yeah going so long without talking to somebody scares the heck out of me
to be quite honest and i think you know that already i still have feelings for you i will not say the lword this letter is probably award enough for you
my dad was still at my grandparents house and he was going to text us when my uncle leftthere is only one thing in the last 12 months i have put on a lot of weight
i have been through so much therapy hostpitalizations on numerous meds i just can not get this hatred and this need for revenge against her out of my system
i am 24 years old but i feel like there is nothing for me in this worldi just created this account i did not know where else to share this
so i have been at my duty station for a little over a year i got here and i had extreme anxiety for having to get qualified so quickly and started drinking a lot and quickly became depressed and having suicidal thoughts and acted on them thoughts
now i am stuck unsure if i made the right decision in keeping it i want to be with him more than anything but i am also already attached to the baby i am 10 weeks so if i want to chemically terminate it would have to be before saturday i do not think i can do that
if you really had problems you would call a hotline are you fucking stupid those people do not even care i was happy but today i do not feel like today is a special day for me
what is addiction is it a disease if so are we experiencing a pathological disease process when we become addicted to the naturallyrewarding endorphin release that comes with exercise are our addictions to the internet and coffee attributable to a disease process too or are those just habits despite one caffeine having a basis on an actual physical chemical dependency
eventually in my senior year i met some guys and we had some fun but looking back it is just because we smoked a lot of weed and i recently decided to leave that group because it was getting in the way of my life and what i wanted to do and there was no real connection
i was often exhausted in the city because of the chaos the pollution and the traffic and i have suffered some toxic relationships over there as well
he told me it was going to bother him to not talk to me but if i think it is what would be best for now he would be okay with it
you said you would ask everyone at a funeral if they are okay before even thinking to consider how you are
i have not texted him in a while and i do not think i ever will ever again to do what who knows but i was sure one friend in particular was manipulating me
i can make money but even then i feel like spending it can not even bring me temporary happiness i was so used to spending it on her
not sure if i will make it to 30 hopefully not but in case i do i hope i can spend these next five years building a version of myself that can better cope with the kind of life i have been given
i just want to smile laugh feel happy again i want the sorrow to end hi everyone i am arno and i am 18
part of me understands this it sucks when you know you care more than the other person i hate being depressing and mopy but this loneliness has been here since i was a kid
i left and was still enraged and i messaged his family telling them what happened and that he is been mentally abusive in the past
i try my best to reach out to the people around me but i do not have the strength to genuinely engage myself into a conversation with them and show them that i want to be their friend
i am not willing to fix his life at this point i know he can do that on his own now i realize it may take longer although obviously i would love to be with him now i would never tell him but i have been waiting to see if he does take charge of his life
she told me she took a couple of sleeping pills and vodka and that she is falling asleep told me she feels like vomitting
ok fine i do not like this shirt is it insightful no it is not insightful because it is not helpful i really hate boys sometimes
it is so hard to let things go away i know i could not have done things differently i know it is not my fault if it ended this way but sometimes i can not help thinking that i missed something somewhere or maybe that i was not good enough for him not good enough to heal his wounds
somedays its a 1 or a 2 and i am just checking out my ceiling fan aware it could hold my weight
i get that they got into relationships and have their own lives and do not live too close but they do not even try to talk to me anymore and it hurts so much
i just feel hella lonely more so than usual i miss her a lot and we share 2 kids together i do not think incompatibility can not be overcome
that was the first time i was really alone that time she really disappeared even after the breakup we did not really stopped talking or hanging out while this time i was really alone
she inhaled fire and ended up burning her throat and she needed a ventilator to breathe she needed 247 care around the clock which is where my 18 year old self came in
seeing my dad hold her was about the cutest thing i had ever seen him do the third dream i saw my daughter to her first day of school
to find happiness is fortunate and fleeting because evil is the backdrop the default you are guaranteed to find evil and you never need to look far
i suffer from chronic loneliness and have lost all of my friends i am not that close with my family so can not go to them for support i feel so empty whenever i do not have people that believe in me i do not really know how to believe in myself
it is been two and some weeks maybe almost three i am not sure i have lost track of time to be honest
it does not make people hear or see nightmares many people in my country are said to be crazy because of there mental illness and never get married and since i want my family to be proud of me i must join the military like the rest i do not see how i am assuming the worst
i was not good in the relationship if i am honest i can admit that i could have been a better person with her
thankfully a mutual friend i told realized how badly i was hurting and told me that staying the same apartment with my ex only opens the wounds even more
fucking no one gives a shit no one cares to even answer mesuddenly us designing floorplans or mapping our way to youtube stardom was replaced by disillusionment and sadness
i try so hard but i just fail every time nobody likes me and despite what people say too me they get tired and bored of me quickly
my ex and i definitely still have feelings for each other but we both have not admitted it to each other since the breakup is it weird if i like one of her tweets that says who wants to hold hands with me
sometimes when i do something i think is wrong i will think not to do it and even out loud sometimes begin to argue like my thoughts are somebody else
i never told anyone because i did not want to sound crazy but i had a hallucination the other night that scared the crap out of me
i am a piece of shit i am a furry loser i hate my life college dropout alcoholic unemployed now due to covid and wondering what i can even see in life in the future
my mental health has made me feel there is no way out and my run ins with trauma has made me a recluse to the world
a coworker has a crush on me in which i was open and he was understanding about how i do not feel ready yet
they carried our love on their shoulders like a burden and that is probably why i am here now i do not think i will ever find someone again
i wanted to make a point in how unfair and unjust it is to just invade peoples privacy like that and how i thought i could trust her
it does not completely solve the problem but it is a big step up from before without it half a year since he left me
it was easter and she spent the whole day with him they discussed it and decided she needed to cut things off with me
things changed when i got older and got good at things especially sports making a heap of matesfriends through my life who are basically non existent now since i finished school and eventually was cut from them groups
she lied to me and decided to fuck me over in the worst way possible and it might have come true if it was not for the vibes i got
and it is my daughters birthday tuesday and i just do not even have the mindset or strength to put on a happy face considering my hormones are all over the place i hate everyone i really try to be the best personfriend i can be and this is the result so i give up trying with people
he made it clear that he wanted our relationship to be solid and secure he made me feel so comfortable and safe with him
and on top of that i am still trying to get over heartbreakreally dramatic title but i was wondering if anyones felt this weird feeling i have noticed
why am i like this tired of being heartbroken and disappointed i want to scream but i am too tired to even do that
i still text him and beg him for love it is pretty pathetic he even replies saying that i need to work on myself
one nite laying in bed at his place i noticed a light shining in the corner that i never saw before
she said the apartment we had held a lot of trauma so she wanted to have a break and some space
my surroundings seem distorted and so do sounds and depth perception i feel like a spectator of my own life and i struggle to get a hold of myself
i gave you back the stuff you gave me so i did not have to look at it but now all i see are the empty spots where they used to be
i am terrified of the further damage he may because by doing things that he would not normally do while he is in this state
you do not realise that you will be okay until you are it hurts now but it is better to go through that hurt now than to regret it in the future
after 3 weeks i decided that i needed to change things i finally started replying to messages that have been piling up for months to meet with old friends and relatives
i have lost most of my friends and barely talk to the ones i still have my parents split up and i can not get along with either of them i am a slob and a horrible person
she still said that she loved me 3 days later she broke up with me i would feel bad writing that except i am pretty sure they want out of here as well
i am in college right now and i made a couple of friends who i thought would sticknot looking for pity just some advice i will be okay thank you
i used to smoke a lot of weed and have kind of anxiety problems with that but a few years ago i stopped and now i smoke just now and than and i do not have that same kind of anxiety i do not know if that has anything to do with it or not
i just wanted to write down these because maybe someone in the world that is having this problem too guys do not feel scared of giving the first step because i know it is hard but you can not let someone make your life bad just because his life it is no that great even if that person it is your own dad 3
we broke up in september and found out he was dating an 18 year old girl 2 days after our breakup
they are moving on with their life and so should you you can not change anythingmost days i can be positive towards my situation
it has been almost two years since we broke upyou are now living happily in another country and i was the one who broke it off
this is a bad holiday for me i shit down and do nothing but lay in bed all day i had a chance to see my dad yet i did not take it i really do not know what do
if we were apart for the day the second my phone went off i would drop whatever i was doing and reply as quickly as possible and stare at my phone for a minute or two until i saw read and then anxiously get stuck just staring at my phone anticipating a response
i am 17f getting to the point in many of my relationships where i am finding others problems to be just ridiculously stupid and i know for them it is a big deal and they are sharing but i can not take them seriously
things do not just go awaybut the way i deal with themand even the way i think of them have been changed forever
i have always hated school and rat race type of life i was skipping classes whole days actually i simply was not interested whenever i thought of school i would get sick and my inner me would scream out of hatred
my older brother no longer tells me he loves me he cashed out the gift i sent him but said nothing to me about it
there is also the fact that in every instruction video i saw the people trying to replace the screen on my model break the hinge
i get no social interaction and have not for the vast majority of my like i am also sick of having complex trauma and mental health problems and not being able to function
it seems to be the case of right person wrong time i am the kind of person that is loyal till the very last moment
then something went wrong i snapped from discovering a horrible revaluation on something going on in the house my mom began panicking
i will start the ball rolling have had 3 random crying spells one was seeing people together on a reddit stream and feelingbeing totally alone another was for the year i have had and the things that have happened to me and the thingspeople i have lost and another was for all the suffering people around the world have been through this last year whether they survived thrived or did not make it through and i know a few of those
family always says i will love you no matter what but it is all fucking conditional they only love you when you do what they want or reach their high expectations
you and i experienced this splendid relationship in this season for a reason and i am truly grateful and appreciative for the companionship and love that you showed me through our relationship
please help i am deep in the abyss of depression any advice in how to make friends and to solve this problem is appreciated
as i grew older i realized the importance of education and the perk of being at the front row nevertheless i could not be as open as i wanted to be
i am done with them now and i am still bitter and angry and hurting i feel like my heart is going to explode
at one point in the movie 22 is caught in some kind of monster with people swirling all around her telling her she is not good enough she had no purpose and can not do anything right
i know it is generally not advised to drink alcohol when taking antidepressants but what happens when you do i really want to drink but at the same time i am scared what will happen if i do ironically
i thought i could develop those few college friendships more during this pandemic but it seems like all of those friends have just resorted to talking to closer friends that they had
i am hoping if i ever run into him again i do not feel emotional yet part of me does not want to see his face for the rest of my life
so for reference i am 16 also i did not know which flair to put i used to see my future like dream about it i could see myself in the future at a job and at my wedding but i do not see it anymore i just can not see myself doing anything in the future like nothing at all
after a while they need space and i get that i will get excited by a new thought sometimes but can not follow through in the least
it is painful this loneliness but i am trying to accept the fact that i will always be alone for the rest of my life
or the stranger shows up and rapes her she feels guilty or hates herself or it does not help her not until i was already desperate for a better explanation
i even had a pregnancy scare and barely cared because i could not get myself to think about what it could mean
to show the grandparents and s that we could handle the responsibility of raising a child in the future i decided to enroll back into school and finish my information systems degree i also agreed to help s get into college as well to get a job as a housing specialist or a counselor as this was her dream job
make sure you have the proper mindset i had the wrong mindset going into it i wish i was mixed
so we work together and hes been flirting with me i am not falling for thati see that i need this hormone of dopamine and serotine
it is always just fuck and leave i hope i can find a girl who would want to be with me for a long time
i am actually angry bc my mother messed up my childhood real bad and addiction was not her fault so i did not feel okay being mad at her although i never hugged her or told her i loved her she was hard to hate and even harder to love like blaming a child who accidentally shot you but you can not bring yourself to just be okay with being so hurt
it is been a few months since we semigot back together for a month after 2 years apart it did not work out and never would the person i fell in love with is now just a memory in my mind not who she is now and i barely think of her anymore
why can not i just erase everything and start on a new paragraph i got to just keep writing the same shitty story day after day
like i always want to stab myself or someone else but not with the intention of killing it is just because i want to know how it feels
a daily fight to just fucking hold on for a little longer when i was younger i used to have an issue with codependency
i was not best to be around with when it all happened but in time i focused on him and myself to get better which helped for a time being
i do not think i deserve oxygen and to breathe the only person who truly loved me was my dad and he died january 2019
so it is a christian song and i am not trying to convert anyone here or anything but the lyrics are really beautiful especially to me because i believe it
he throwing a freaking party with his friends he said he does not care about covid19 so now i am scared to death he will get it or give it to his family
so as people get smarter suicidal people will also get smarter right meaning that they will have more of a reason to kill themselves and it will be harder to stop them from doing so since it is easy to kill yourself if you think about it
i do not want to be here i just wish i could not wake up one day i said i would only break up with him when hell froze over and he felt the same
people started texting me only when the semester began again and only for favors i miss your kindness and your comfort i miss your presence next to me
over the next few months i began to go back to my old who are ways meanwhile i was talking to my best friend of 17 years
she also told me that all men will ever want to do to me is fk me that i loved you i still love you and i am scared that i always will
you lost your love and now you miss your dreamin i have searched my entire life for something to make it make sense
said exactly what was on my mind stuck to my morals had great relationships and hustled the job school and social life like no problem
she was everything to me and my best friend and now we do not even talk a lot of people have gone through worse a lot of people have dealt with heartbreak before
i just wish i did not feel like i had to do this all myself but that is the uncomfortable realization we have to face right we are alone ultimately
i have never had any romantic interest in them and they have never in me at least that i know of now most of them are married with children and going on disney vacations instead of playing poker
sometimes i think that i should just fill the void with random hookups because the boredom of literally having no one to talk to is driving me depressed and it is nice to feel some kind of intimacy even if it is not real
i am new to this sub and just posted a few minutes ago but after scrolling through for a few minutes i am already beginning to feel better thank you all so much
one thing i wonder is if i should send my ex a message he says he still cares about me and my wellbeing but i do not know how true that is
i feel so torn pressured and obligated to do things like spend equal amounts of time at each parents house do everything my parents and siblings ask me to do withfor them and not object or because any problems
this is important to me because i am a very creative person who has always loved movies books just about everything based on magic or people with super powers
i want him to move on and be happy because that is what he deservestoday should have been our one year anniversary
she made everything better no matter what the problem was and it carried into high school i fell behind on my work in class but with her beside me i actually tried
i keep thinking of the what ifs if i had only just been more focused in my earlier life and sorted myself out
she does not like drama she usually tries to handle things by herself or in a mature manner and she does not agree with rebounds or meaningless hookups
my first therapist i saw for 11 years then i went 10 years without seeing a regular therapist i hate being around people especially my family
so my question would be am i qualified or have been hit hard enough by life to get this tattoo but in the form of jewelry or is my case not serious enough to get it
i have lost almost all interest in the hobbies i used to enjoy such as playing instruments or doing paintingart also i have a hard time focusing on things now
for example one of the first girls that became my friend started ignoring me after a month of knowing her and i have a long list of failed friendships but i digress
fast forward a bit i a guy with whom i get along the most among classmates bob and tim decide to go out one night dink something and have some fun and talk
through some foolish contact she would tell me how her parents were upset with her decision to leave me it was a good first school year just because of her
i asked her if it was me but she said it was her she needed to deal with stress about school homework stress in general and an ex who was abusive
all that to say sometimes people really do need space hey i hope you had a great day again almost 30 and never once had a real relationship in my life
there is been no drama since and we get on really well if not better now though i have had reoccurring gut wrenching feelings when he talks to other people
but it is not a nice thing to receive a message on instagram one day later telling me how shit of a driver i am and how i am a dickhead for causing the crash
some back story around the time that we broke up we were both going through a hard time emotionally with our families not liking some of our life direction choices as an individual a lot of conflict and going through our own things which lead to us arguing and just not really having a good time as a couple and ultimately lead to our break up
my failure and gods inability to answer or help fuck himthis shit sounds painfulthat is the only part of my plan that i am incredibly uneducated about
i already begged and pleaded but with no result but i gave that girl all that i knew how to give and then some
it does not help that i think like this everyday or that i have these constant mood swings whenever i am around my mom
i do not even know if i want kids and i said it and they keep saying who is going to look after you when you are older i feel like they only had me to look after them
he also is applying to grad school atm which is also up in the air of where he will be for the next few years
there is nothing bad going on in my life right now i am in a better place than i was a few years ago
i really hope i die in my sleep before the year is over i am just so tired of living now i have suffered enough
you feel like you can not talk about it anymore in a serious conversation since all you here is how relatable you are even though they have a good organized life where everything is fine and bills have been paid
i typically am not a fan of the holidays for past reasons but this year i was extra nonexcited due to going through a break up after 35 years that happened right before thanksgiving it fucking sucks my heart hurts every day
i remember finding something that suggested that i was dealing with speech blocks and it described what i was dealing with pretty well other than the times when i completely mixed up my sentences and slurred them
i have no motivation to do anything or keep goingwhat would you like to include that is not that well known about the issue
my parents said stuff like they wished i was not ever born how my mother wished she aborted me when she could have that i am dumb worthless
my college is about 45 minutes from our hometown btw when i broke up with her i barley felt pain or heartbreak
i was actively trying to make friends but they just kept on ignoring me even some people at my job said are you new here
the thought of going back makes me want to cry she does not know shit about me even tho i keep on telling her my things my plans my dreams
he held me as i was breaking up with him and told me he loved me i am so so ashamed of how i acted and of course now i miss him i do not know what to do
